<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>An 11-year-old boy from California expressed his appreciation for the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>He wrote: “I am grateful for it, and I encourage other families to read this book because it is great. It is . . . helping my family to find peace and happiness in our home.” This youngster’s experience should encourage us to offer the <em>Family Happiness </em>book to people of all ages. Here are a few suggestions that you may want to try in your ministry during February.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When meeting a young person, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Many in your age group are thinking about marriage. But where can you find reliable information on the subject? [Allow for response.] Young people often say that they are not sure if they are ready for marriage. Let me share with you what this handbook says about the subject.” Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996021/4:147-7:695">page 14 in the <em>Family Happiness</em></a> book, and read paragraph 3. Then point out each subheading in the chapter. Offer the book, and arrange to return.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When speaking with a parent, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “We are sharing with parents some practical guidelines that really work for raising children. These have been compiled in this handbook <em>The Secret of Family Happiness.” </em>Turn to page 55. Read paragraph 10, followed by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a>, in paragraph 11. Then point out the italicized sentences in paragraphs 12 to 16. Continue by saying: “This book has helped many to achieve greater success as parents. If you would like to read it, I will be pleased to give you this copy.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When talking to an elderly person, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “After I read this brief comment, please tell me what you think.” Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996033/21:388-24:512"><em>Family Happiness </em>book to page 169</a>, and read the first two sentences of paragraph 17. Then ask for a response. Depending on the reply, you might read further excerpts from the book before offering it.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>When following up placements of the <em>Family Happiness </em>book, have in mind trying to start a Bible study. <a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996048/">Lesson 8</a> in the <em>Require </em>brochure or <a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995026/">chapter 15</a> in the <em>Knowledge </em>book may be an appropriate place to begin. In the process, let us endeavor to help people of all ages to build a happy Christian family life.</p>

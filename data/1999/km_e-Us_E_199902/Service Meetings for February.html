<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>How Are We Benefited By Enrollment in the Theocratic Ministry School? Audience discussion conducted by the school overseer. Training in public speaking is not the only purpose of the school. There are other ways in which we directly benefit. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1101971051/15-22"><em>School Guidebook, </em>pages 12-13</a>.) We learn how to communicate better with other people. We are taught to speak with clarity, poise, and self-confidence. We become skilled in answering questions about our beliefs and in explaining our Bible-based decisions. Our knowledge of the Bible increases, helping us to be more effective in witnessing to others. We learn to acknowledge our shortcomings and to accept counsel, which results in our dealing more amicably with others. The overall training that the school provides helps us to remain “adequately qualified” as God’s ministers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:5-47:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:5, 6</a>.</p>

It is difficult to witness to people living in apartments where conversation is limited to what can be said through an intercom. Consider ways to create interest. In a friendly manner, introduce yourself as a neighbor; use the householder’s name if it is shown on the directory; mention a timely subject that you want to discuss, or read an introduction directly from the <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/1-64$p/E:1101989203/"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 9-15;</a> and explain that you wish to deliver a tract, magazine, or brochure that answers an important question, and state what it is. Where contact is limited, write letters to the tenants or witness to them on the street as they come and go. Demonstrate a method used locally that has achieved good results with apartment dwellers.</p>

Offer the Family Happiness Book to People of All Ages
1 An 11-year-old boy from California expressed his appreciation for the book The Secret of Family Happiness. He wrote: “I am grateful for it, and I encourage other families to read this book because it is great. It is . . . helping my family to find peace and happiness in our home.” This youngster’s experience should encourage us to offer the Family Happiness book to people of all ages. Here are a few suggestions that you may want to try in your ministry during February.
2 When meeting a young person, you might say:
▪ “Many in your age group are thinking about marriage. But where can you find reliable information on the subject? [Allow for response.] Young people often say that they are not sure if they are ready for marriage. Let me share with you what this handbook says about the subject.” Turn to page 14 in the Family Happiness book, and read paragraph 3. Then point out each subheading in the chapter. Offer the book, and arrange to return.
3 When speaking with a parent, you could say:
▪ “We are sharing with parents some practical guidelines that really work for raising children. These have been compiled in this handbook The Secret of Family Happiness.” Turn to page 55. Read paragraph 10, followed by Deuteronomy 6:6, 7, in paragraph 11. Then point out the italicized sentences in paragraphs 12 to 16. Continue by saying: “This book has helped many to achieve greater success as parents. If you would like to read it, I will be pleased to give you this copy.”
4 When talking to an elderly person, you might say:
▪ “After I read this brief comment, please tell me what you think.” Open the Family Happiness book to page 169, and read the first two sentences of paragraph 17. Then ask for a response. Depending on the reply, you might read further excerpts from the book before offering it.
5 When following up placements of the Family Happiness book, have in mind trying to start a Bible study. Lesson 8 in the Require brochure or chapter 15 in the Knowledge book may be an appropriate place to begin. In the process, let us endeavor to help people of all ages to build a happy Christian family life.

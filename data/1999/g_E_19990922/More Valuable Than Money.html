<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“[She] gave her daughter a gift far more valuable than any amount of money,” acknowledged an editorial comment in <em>The Monitor </em>newspaper of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia. What was the gift? It was her “wonderful example of honesty.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Anna and her daughter Tanya stopped at a yard sale and bought a white purse to hold Tanya’s Bible. When they arrived home, Tanya opened a zipper inside the purse and was astonished to find $1,000 in bills. Immediately, mother and daughter returned to the yard sale and handed the money to the lady who had sold them the purse. Apparently, the seldom-used purse had belonged to her recently deceased mother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, and it had not been closely examined before being sold. Extremely grateful, the lady remarked: “It restores my faith in people . . . It’s nice to know there are honest people out there.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A front-page article about the incident in the local newspaper quoted Anna as saying: “As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we couldn’t consider anything else. We have a Bible-based [conscience]. We also want to teach Tanya what’s right.” For Tanya, the new white purse will be a special reminder of a lesson in honesty.</p>

“My Greatest Desire”
A CLASS of students in Vranje, Yugoslavia, were assigned to write a paper on the above subject. The following is the essay of eight-year-old Sergej, whose composition was later posted at the school for all to read.
“First, I wanted to write that my greatest desire is to finish school with the best grades and to go to Belgrade for vacation. But at home I was thinking about something else. My greatest desire is for the whole world to be at peace, for all people to live happily, and for them to love and help one another. I would like all people to be healthy and our planet to be cleaner than it is now.
“Today the earth is polluted with chemicals. Water and air are contaminated too. Because of hunger in the world, thousands of children are dying every day, and many more are dying because of illnesses. I would like all that to disappear, and I would like all children to feel their parents’ love, so that they can go to sleep joyfully and happily, knowing that each tomorrow will be a beautiful day. This is not possible in this world, but in the future it will be. This is my greatest desire.”
What made Sergej certain that these things will be realized? He believes in the promises of God as described in the Bible. The brochure Does God Really Care About Us? describes these promises in the section entitled “The Marvelous New World of God’s Making.” You can obtain a copy of this brochure by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

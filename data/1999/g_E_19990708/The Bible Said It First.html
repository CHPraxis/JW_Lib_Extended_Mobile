<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “Conversation was never begun at once, nor in a hurried manner. No one was quick with a question, no matter how important, and no one was pressed for an answer. A pause giving time for thought was the truly courteous way of beginning and conducting a conversation. Silence was meaningful with the Lakota . . . [This] was done in the practice of true politeness and regard for the rule that, ‘thought comes before speech.’”—Luther Standing Bear, Oglala Sioux chief (1868?-1939).</p>

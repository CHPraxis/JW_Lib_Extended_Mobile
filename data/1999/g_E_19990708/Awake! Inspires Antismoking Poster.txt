Awake! Inspires Antismoking Poster
BY AWAKE! CORRESPONDENT IN ITALY
RECENTLY, in the city of Mortara in northern Italy, the Italian Anticancer League and a local newspaper organized a contest among high school students to design an antismoking poster. Fourteen-year-old Simona, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, consulted various issues of Awake! for ideas about the dangers of tobacco, particularly the July 8, 1989, and May 22, 1995, issues. Simona writes: “When doing research, I was struck by the covers of these issues. I drew a skull with a cigarette in its mouth like the one I saw in Awake!, and the cover title gave me the idea for my slogan.” Her slogan was, “Smoking—It Kills Millions of People to Make Millions.” Her poster was one of 250 entered in the contest.
Although Simona was younger than many of the other students in the contest, she was awarded the first prize, including a $300 scholarship. Simona wrote to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society to express her gratitude for the effective covers of Awake! that gave her the ideas. She enjoys reading Awake! not only because of its covers but also because of its timely and practical articles regarding health, current events, and the challenges facing young people. She concludes her letter: “PS: Keep up the good work!”

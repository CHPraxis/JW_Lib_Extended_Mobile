The Bible Said It First
● “Conversation was never begun at once, nor in a hurried manner. No one was quick with a question, no matter how important, and no one was pressed for an answer. A pause giving time for thought was the truly courteous way of beginning and conducting a conversation. Silence was meaningful with the Lakota . . . [This] was done in the practice of true politeness and regard for the rule that, ‘thought comes before speech.’”—Luther Standing Bear, Oglala Sioux chief (1868?-1939).
“Know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath.”—James 1:19, the Bible (first century C.E.).
“The heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer, but the mouth of the wicked ones bubbles forth with bad things.”—Proverbs 15:28, the Bible (about eighth century B.C.E.).
“All his spirit is what a stupid one lets out, but he that is wise keeps it calm to the last.”—Proverbs 29:11, the Bible (about eighth century B.C.E.).

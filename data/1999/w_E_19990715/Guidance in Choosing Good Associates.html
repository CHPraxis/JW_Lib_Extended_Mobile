<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">YOUNGSTERS look to their peers rather than to their parents for guidance on clothing and music, observes a report in the <em>Reader’s Digest. </em>It is therefore vital for parents to know who their children associate with and where.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It is your responsibility to investigate,” says Esmé van Rensburg, senior lecturer in the department of psychology at a South African university. She adds: “The chances are that your child will be annoyed with you, but they will cool down.” Then she gives the following tips to parents. Rules should be logical and have definite underlying principles; listen to your child; don’t overreact, but keep calm, and know what you want to say. If your child has already developed a friendship with an undesirable associate, focus on the unacceptable behavior the friendship has promoted instead of merely forbidding further association.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sound advice for parents has long been available in God’s Word, the Bible. For instance, it states: “Be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>) The Scriptures also give this fine advice on the choice of associates: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) These examples illustrate the wisdom available to those who read the Bible with appreciation and apply what it says in daily life.</p>

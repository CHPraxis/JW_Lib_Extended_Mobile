<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what the brochure <em>A Book for All People </em>did for a man from Mexico. This is what he wrote about the brochure:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The new and reasonable way the subjects are broached leaves the reader with the desire to read the Bible. . . . I personally enjoyed the introduction, the references, and the subjects ‘A Book That “Speaks” Living Languages,’ ‘Can This Book Be Trusted?,’ and ‘Does This Book Agree With Science?’ Each one is simple, soundly based, and illustrated. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Personally, I have been greatly encouraged by this information. I have had the joy of reading the whole Bible, but the first thing I did after reading this brochure was to acquire a large-print Bible. Now, a week thereafter, I am reading the Bible with greater enthusiasm and with the desire to learn more.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE above is what a reader from North Carolina, U.S.A., wrote about the book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>which was published last year. She added: “Thank you for lighting fires of curiosity in my heart and mind.” She then noted the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Today, while sitting on my back porch, I saw a bright green inchworm. It moved about so carefully. Cautiously, it checked each forward movement and then, ever so gracefully, continued. However, it was on the last plank of our porch decking. I thought that if it fell off for some reason—a fall of perhaps five feet <strong>[a meter and a half]</strong>—it would probably not be seriously harmed. Yet, if a man fell a comparable distance, it would surely kill him.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The woman wondered, “What makes the little green inchworm so different?” She concluded that this is “only one of millions of questions that will be exciting to have answered. But, in the meantime, we can learn many things about our Creator from that little green worm.”</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Our Choice​—The <em>New World Translation. </em>Talk and demonstrations. Among religious organizations, ours is unique in that we publish, use, and distribute a translation of the Bible produced by anointed worshipers of Jehovah. It is not that we desire to profit commercially or to disseminate sectarian beliefs. Rather, we are motivated by a desire to honor God’s name and to help others get to know him better. Other translations often render God’s Word in a form difficult to understand, so review the distinct advantages of the <em>New World Translation. </em>(See <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101990134/41:53-42$p/E:1101990135/1-62"><em>“All Scripture” </em>book, pages 327-31</a>. Note comments in paragraph 3, point out examples of improved renderings in paragraph 6, and highlight benefits covered in paragraphs 22-3.) Have two brief demonstrations that suggest how we might respond when others say, “You have your own Bible.”​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989250/17:115-24$p/E:1101989251/"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 279-80</a>.</p>

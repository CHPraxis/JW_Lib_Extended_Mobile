See the Power of the Bible!
How? By viewing the video The Bible​—Its Power in Your Life. It is the third volume in the videocassette series entitled The Bible​—A Book of Fact and Prophecy.
Do you want a successful marriage? Do you need help to survive difficult times? How can young people grow up to be responsible adults? The Bible can help, as this video shows. Hear people tell of the power for good that the Bible has been in their lives. Listen to them explain how its principles have helped them face the problems of modern-day life.
This video is a valuable tool for helping newly interested ones see the benefits of using God’s Word as a guide in their lives. The Society has The Bible​—Its Power in Your Life in stock. You may request a copy through the congregation literature servant.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Many people ask, “What makes Jehovah’s Witnesses different from other religions?” How would you reply? You could explain some of our Bible-based beliefs. But have you also thought about pointing out how much our public ministry sets us apart from other religions?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Today, few religious people feel motivated to share their beliefs with others. They may think that it is sufficient to obey Caesar’s laws, to lead a morally decent life, or to do kind deeds for others. However, they feel no obligation to help others learn what the Bible says about gaining salvation. How are we different?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Our zealous ministry stands in sharp contrast with the activities of other religions. For over 100 years, modern-day Witnesses have diligently preached the good news to the ends of the earth, in imitation of the early Christians. Our objective in doing so is to help as many people as possible bring their lives into harmony with God’s will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>What Is Your Reputation? </strong>Are you known as a zealous preacher of God’s Word? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:2-44:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:25-44:18:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18:25</a>) Because of your preaching activity, do your neighbors readily see the difference between their religion and yours? Are you known as one who is eager to share his hope with others? Do you have a regular routine for participating in the ministry? Remember that we distinguish ourselves not only by our name but also by our doing what that name describes​—witnessing about Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Love for God and for neighbor motivates us to engage in the preaching activity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>) That is why we, like Jesus and the apostles, want to take advantage of every opportunity to share the Kingdom message with others. May we continue to preach the good news zealously to those who are willing to listen. Doing so will help honesthearted ones to “see the distinction between . . . one serving God and one who has not served him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:18-39:3:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mal. 3:18</a>.</p>

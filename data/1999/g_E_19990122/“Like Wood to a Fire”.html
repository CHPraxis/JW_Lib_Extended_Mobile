<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is how Jennifer, a 16-year-old girl from Oakland, California, U.S.A., described the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. “By continually feeding my zeal with their contents, I blaze strong,” is the way she put it. “The way things are written,” she said, “makes it obvious that they are being written to reveal the truth of matters to those in the dark.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jennifer also wrote to express thanks for “all the information that defends the validity of the Bible.” She noted: “Almost every person I talk to lacks confidence in the Bible. The fact that all this information proving that the Bible is worthy of examination is being published lets me know that this information isn’t needed only where I live.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is very true. Information highlighting the value of the Bible is clearly needed worldwide. That is why the brochure <em>A Book for All People </em>has been provided. It answers such questions as: Can the Bible be trusted? Does it agree with science? Is it a practical book for modern living?</p>

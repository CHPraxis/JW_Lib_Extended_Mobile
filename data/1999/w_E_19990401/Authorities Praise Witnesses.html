<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN Cádiz, Spain, a seaport city situated some 300 miles <strong>[500 km] </strong>southwest of Madrid, mayor Doña Teófila Martínez presented a plaque (pictured above) to Jehovah’s Witnesses. It reads: “The city hall of Cádiz to Jehovah’s Witnesses in appreciation for their collaboration and efforts in behalf of this city.” What did the Witnesses do to receive this honor?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It was given in recognition of the work the Witnesses had done to renovate part of the city’s municipal stadium. Over several weekends, hundreds of Witnesses volunteered to help remodel the ground-floor restrooms of the Carranza football stadium. Now, all who use the stadium benefit from the pipes, plumbing fixtures, and flooring that were installed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For some time, Jehovah’s Witnesses have enjoyed a good relationship with the city of Cádiz. Every year, city hall kindly makes the Carranza Stadium available to the Witnesses for their annual district convention. Therefore, the Witnesses are glad to do what they can to help keep the stadium in good repair.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In addition to occasional physical labors, however, Jehovah’s Witnesses regularly visit the city’s neighborhoods to support the public in another way. They proclaim the “good news” of God’s Kingdom. Of course, they do not engage in their public ministry in order to receive praise from men. It is performed in obedience to Jesus’ command to preach the “good news of the kingdom” and to “make disciples of people of all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:19</a>) In this way, Jehovah’s Witnesses hope to serve the community by educating people in “the path of righteousness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:28-20:12:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:28</a>.</p>

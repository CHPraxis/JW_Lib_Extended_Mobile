“Happy Husband of a Charming Wife”
OCCASIONALLY, some people pointedly accuse Jehovah’s Witnesses of breaking up marriages. However, numerous successful marriages where only one spouse is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses show this to be far from the truth. Taking heed of the Bible’s counsel in family life makes for happy marriages, as the following letter published in a French newspaper shows.
“For almost 28 years now, I’ve been the happy husband of a charming wife who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She raised my five children, of whom two were not her own, with equal care and much love. Being at the present time a company director with 45 employees, I can assure you that she has contributed greatly to my professional success. That is why when I saw an article in my regular newspaper presenting Jehovah’s Witnesses as a threat to the Lot-et-Garonne region, I decided to provide you with an authoritative testimony.”
The letter also says: “They do not smoke or get drunk. Is this a threat? They are tolerant Christians who do not impose on anybody the rules that they follow. Rather, they are an example in many areas. . . . They are not involved in financial scandals or in drug trafficking. They do not take a vow of chastity, and I can assure you, they live normal lives. . . .
“You may well ask me: So why aren’t you yourself one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Because Christian faith and strict morals are needed, and these are not easily found among common mortals.”

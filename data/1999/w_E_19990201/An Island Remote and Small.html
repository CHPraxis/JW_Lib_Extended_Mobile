<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE adjectives most frequently used to describe the island of St. Helena are “remote” and “small.” That is fitting, for this island, ten and a half miles <strong>[17 km] </strong>long and six and a half miles <strong>[10 km] </strong>wide, is 1,200 miles <strong>[1,950 km] </strong>from the nearest land, the southwest coast of Africa. It was here that Napoléon Bonaparte was sent in 1815 to live out his last years as a defeated exile.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From the ocean the island looks like a formidable fortress. It is actually an extinct volcano rising steeply from the Atlantic with sheer cliffs reaching 1,600 to 2,300 feet <strong>[500 to 700 m] </strong>high. At its center, Mt. Actaeon, at 2,685 feet <strong>[818 m]</strong>, dominates the entire island. On account of the cool South Atlantic trade wind and ocean current, the island has a generally mild and pleasant climate. But from the low-lying coastline to the mountainous interior, there is a great variety of weather conditions and vegetation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">St. Helena has been a British possession since the late 17th century. The small population of some 5,000 is a mixture of people of European, Asian, and African origins. English is used throughout the island, but it is spoken with a distinctive accent. There is no airport here; the only tie with the outside world is by ship, with regular passage to South Africa and England. In fact, broadcast television became available only in the mid-1990’s, thanks to a satellite hookup.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the early 1930’s, the good news of God’s Kingdom reached these shores for the first time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Through the years, many islanders have taken hold of this treasure that makes material riches insignificant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>) Today, St. Helena enjoys the distinction of having a Witness-to-population ratio of 1 to 31, the best in the world!</p>

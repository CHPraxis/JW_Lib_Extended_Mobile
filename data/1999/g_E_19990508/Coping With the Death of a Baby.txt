Coping With the Death of a Baby
A MOTHER from Britain wrote to express appreciation for the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. “The brochure is certainly food at the proper time for our family.” Then she explained:
“The experiences related in the brochure were ones we could identify with. It was so comforting to know that others have felt, and do feel, as we have.
“I especially appreciated the part that acknowledged that a miscarriage is a death and causes grief. Because the baby hasn’t actually lived outside the womb and become a person to them, many do not understand this grief.
“My miscarriages weren’t such in the conventional sense of the word . . . I had to have labor induced on both occasions and gave birth to dead babies. I echo the words of Veronica (on page 10 of the brochure), who said: ‘To give birth to a dead baby is a terrible thing for a mother.’”

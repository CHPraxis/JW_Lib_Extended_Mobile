<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MOTHER from Britain wrote to express appreciation for the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>“The brochure is certainly food at the proper time for our family.” Then she explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The experiences related in the brochure were ones we could identify with. It was so comforting to know that others have felt, and do feel, as we have.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I especially appreciated the part that acknowledged that a miscarriage is a death and causes grief. Because the baby hasn’t actually lived outside the womb and become a person to them, many do not understand this grief.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“My miscarriages weren’t such in the conventional sense of the word . . . I had to have labor induced on both occasions and gave birth to dead babies. I echo the words of Veronica (on page 10 of the brochure), who said: ‘To give birth to a dead baby is a terrible thing for a mother.’”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah’s organization provides a regular program of theocratic activities designed to satisfy our spiritual needs. Appreciation moves us to take full advantage of everything arranged, such as visits of the traveling overseer, assemblies and conventions, and other special activities planned locally. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) However, some miss out on many of these spiritual provisions because of other commitments they have made. What can be done to prevent this? How can we make sure that nontheocratic activities do not crowd out “the more important things”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Wise Planning Is Essential: </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a> admonishes: “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want.” To get the spiritual “advantage,” we need to plan ahead diligently, keeping in mind theocratic activities that have been arranged. We should schedule our personal activities for a time when they will not interfere with our being on hand to reap spiritual blessings. If we hastily make plans to do things we personally want to do, without giving thought to upcoming theocratic events, it is likely that we will suffer spiritual “want.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Do Not Miss Out! </strong>All of us make plans for the future, including for vacations, business trips, visits with relatives, and so forth. Before you commit yourself or finalize your plans, consult the schedule of upcoming spiritual activities. If you find that the circuit overseer is coming or that an assembly is scheduled at the same time you might be away, make an earnest effort to rearrange your affairs so that you can participate. We are informed well in advance about major events scheduled for the future. The elders in your congregation can tell you what has been planned locally.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>By exercising foresight and planning ahead for the more important things, we will be “filled with righteous fruit, . . . to God’s glory and praise.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:11-50:1:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 1:11</a>.</p>

You Are Cordially Invited
THE death of the man Jesus Christ over 1,900 years ago was the most important event in history. It opened up the prospect of attaining everlasting life under Paradise conditions. During a simple ceremony, Jesus used wine and unleavened bread as symbols of his loving human sacrifice. Then he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) Will you remember?
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to join them in observing this Memorial celebration. It will be held after sundown on the date that corresponds to Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. You can attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place. The date for the celebration this year is Thursday, April 1.

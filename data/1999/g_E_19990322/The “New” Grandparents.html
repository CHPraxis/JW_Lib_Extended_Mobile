<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Welcome to Grandma and Grandpa’s—Children Spoiled While You Wait.” So reads the sign on the entrance to Gene and Jane’s home.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">STEP inside, however, and you will not see an elderly couple in rocking chairs. Rather, you will find a youthful, energetic couple in their 40’s. Far from shunning their roles as ‘elder statesmen,’ Gene and Jane have enthusiastically embraced grandparenthood. “True, it’s one of those little signals in life that you’re getting older,” says Gene, “but this is one of the rewards, the payback for raising your kids—grandchildren.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">An ancient proverb says: “The crown of old men is the grandsons.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:6-20:17:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:6</a>) Grandparents and grandchildren often enjoy a very special bond of love and closeness. And according to the journal <em>Generations, </em>“an unprecedented number of people in American society are grandparents.” The reason? “Increased life expectancy and new rhythms in the family life cycle,” explains the article. “Changes in mortality and fertility mean that an estimated three-quarters of adults will live to be grandparents . . . Most middle-aged people become grandparents around age 45.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A new generation of grandparents has arisen in some lands. Many, though, are finding themselves more and more involved in caring for their grandchildren. For example, Gene and Jane’s son and former daughter-in-law have divorced and share custody. “We are trying to help out by caring for our grandson while our son works,” explains Jane. According to one survey, grandparents in the United States who look after their grandchildren average about 14 hours a week doing so. This amounts to as much as 29 <em>billion </em>dollars worth of labor a year!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE death of the man Jesus Christ over 1,900 years ago was the most important event in history. It opened up the prospect of attaining everlasting life under Paradise conditions. During a simple ceremony, Jesus used wine and unleavened bread as symbols of his loving human sacrifice. Then he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) Will you remember?</p>

“Tall as a Cedar on Lebanon”
ON THE beautiful mountains of Lebanon grow trees that are known as Arz Ar-rab, meaning “Cedars of the Lord.” These imposing evergreens, which once blanketed the mountains, are mentioned in the Bible some 70 times​—more than any other tree.
To describe the stately cedars of Lebanon, the Scriptures use the words “choice” and “majestic.” (Song of Solomon 5:15; Ezekiel 17:23) The cedar’s size and the durability of its wood have long made it popular for building homes and ships as well as for making furniture. The fragrance and warm red color of the wood are very attractive, and its high resin content makes it resistant to decay and insect infestation. The trees are strikingly tall and massive, attaining a height of up to 120 feet [37 m] and a circumference of up to 40 feet [12 m], and they have deep, strong roots. No wonder some modern foresters have described them as “the crowning glory of the plant world”!
The Bible writer Ezekiel prophetically likened the Messiah to a twig of a cedar, which God himself then plants. (Ezekiel 17:22) In fact, the Hebrew word for “cedar” comes from a root meaning “to be firm.” Today, followers of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, likewise need to “stand firm in the faith, . . . grow mighty,” like a tall, resilient cedar. (1 Corinthians 16:13) How can this be accomplished? By firmly resisting unchristian influences and steadfastly enduring in a course of integrity and godly devotion. Those who do so are described in the Bible as “the righteous . . . [who] grow tall as a cedar on Lebanon.”​—Psalm 92:12, The New English Bible.

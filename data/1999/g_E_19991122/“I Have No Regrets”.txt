“I Have No Regrets”
“I enjoy reading newspapers, novels, and poetry, but I never had any interest in reading Awake!” writes a man from northern Brazil. “Whenever I saw Jehovah’s Witnesses coming, I would close the door of my modest apartment and keep quiet so they would not suspect that I was at home. When I did speak to them, it was to accept the magazines as quickly as possible and put them away without reading them.
“One fine day I had nothing to read, so I picked up the September 22, 1997, Awake! with the cover title ‘Beware of Swindlers!’ Its clear presentation of information and teachings left me spellbound. Without delay, I searched out all the copies that I had acquired in the past and had laid around the house. Then I got in touch with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and subscribed to Awake! I have been receiving the magazine and reading it for eight months now, and I have no regrets.”
As you might expect, Jehovah’s Witnesses produce other publications that focus on topics that many people wonder about. Many ask: “Does God really care about humans? If so, why does he permit suffering? Will it ever end?” These questions are answered in the 32-page brochure Does God Really Care About Us?

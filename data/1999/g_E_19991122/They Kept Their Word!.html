<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ANTONIO, who was in his last year of high school, wanted to give an informal witness to his classmates. So he suggested that his history teacher show the video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault. </em>Although skeptical, the teacher agreed, saying that she would show the video on the following day.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“At the beginning,” relates Antonio, “the teacher was watching the video with an air of superiority; but when she realized that eminent historians were narrating the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the concentration camps, she paid close attention. At the end she thanked me for suggesting the video.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">During the next lesson, the teacher tried to describe the work of the <em>Bibelforscher, </em>as Jehovah’s Witnesses were known at that time in Germany; but she realized that it would be better to let Antonio do it. Antonio explained the Witnesses’ role in society and some of their doctrines. He concluded by saying: “Obviously, people can’t get any benefit from the precious message we bear if they don’t listen to us, if they slam their doors in our faces, or if they don’t read our publications.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">All Antonio’s classmates agreed with this reflection, and the teacher proposed a resolution to the class. At the first opportunity, they would listen to the Witnesses and accept their publications. The class continued to talk about the video for some time. You can imagine Antonio’s satisfaction over the next few days when he saw several of his fellow students arrive in class with Watchtower publications and heard each of them say with a smile: “You see, I kept my word!”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PEOPLE respond to modern-day stories of angelic encounters in several ways. First, there are the believers. They argue that because such stories are so numerous and so widespread, they must be true. Second, there are the skeptics. They point out that there is no solid evidence to support the claims. Widespread belief, they argue, does not make something true. After all, people once believed in mermaids. Third, there are those on neutral ground. Expressing this neutral view, the book <em>Angels—Opposing Viewpoints </em>states: “Many people claim to have seen angels. These sightings can’t be proved; they are believed on faith. Neither can skeptics disprove them, however, and few try.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many people agree that the Bible is a <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>reliable source of information about the spirit realm.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> It can help us to evaluate modern angel stories. As you probably know, the Bible assures us that angels are real, powerful, glorious spirit creatures. The Bible contains accounts of angels delivering messages and rescuing God’s servants from harm.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:1-19:104:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:4-19:104:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:33" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 1:26-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:6-44:12:11" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Acts 12:6-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible also indicates that there are evil angels. These spirit creatures deceive and mislead humans, turning them away from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>) For good reason, the Bible cautions: “Do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:1-62:4:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 4:1</a>) For example, before we would believe the predictions of a self-proclaimed prophet, we would wisely measure what he says against the Word of God, which he might claim to represent. Surely, we should expect the modern-day accounts of angelic appearances to stand up to the same scrutiny. How, then, do stories of modern-day angelic encounters compare with what is recorded in Scripture?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Angels Are Not What Many Believe</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Let us begin by clearing up two widespread misconceptions about angels. Contrary to popular belief, angels did not begin their lives as humans. They existed in heaven long before God created life on earth. The Bible says that at the time when God “founded the earth . . . , all the [angelic] sons of God began shouting in applause.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Another modern misconception is that angels are permissive and tolerant of wrongdoing. Instead, faithful angels uphold God’s righteous standards and act according to his direction. They are in the service of God, not humans.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:20-19:103:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 103:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Angels Are Interested in Our Spiritual Welfare</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Among current angel stories, rescue accounts abound. In one best-selling book, we read of a young girl who is gently led from a burning house by an unseen hand. Another book tells of two college students stranded in a blizzard. Suddenly, a truck appears and tows them to safety, yet it leaves no tracks! Elsewhere, another story tells of Ann, who is stricken with cancer. Three days before she is to enter the hospital for surgery, a tall stranger comes to her door. He introduces himself as Thomas and says that he has been sent by God. Thomas holds up his hand, and Ann feels a hot, white light pass through her body. When she arrives for her surgery, the doctors are astounded. Her cancer is gone!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These stories raise an obvious question, If everyone has a guardian angel, why are some people rescued, whereas many are not? <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>Countless millions have died from disease, wars, famines, and natural disasters. Surely, many earnestly prayed for help. Why didn’t a guardian angel save them?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible offers help with this question. It points out that God is not partial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 10:34</a>) Furthermore, while God’s loyal angels are interested in our physical welfare, they are more interested in our <em>spiritual </em>welfare. The apostle Paul suggested this in question form: “Are [angels] not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:14-58:1:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:14</a>) Physical help brings temporary benefits, but spiritual help can bring eternal benefits.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Many angel stories seem frivolous. Angels are said to help a tired mother change the sheets on a bed, to remind a shopper to buy matches, and to help drivers find parking places. A young woman in Scotland says with a giggle: “I’ve parked my car on a yellow line in St Mary’s Street for the past three weeks and asked my angel to surround it with love and compassion. If any traffic warden does approach they’ll be so overwhelmed with feelings of love that they’ll leave my car alone. I’ve never had a ticket yet.” Little wonder that some compare the modern-day guardian angel to a fairy godmother or a Santa Claus for grown-ups.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Faithful Angels Do Not Contradict God’s Word</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Angel books are full of adages and advice supposedly from the spirit realm. For instance, one book claims to contain teachings passed on from the archangel Michael to a woman in Colorado, U.S.A. Among the “sayings” from Michael is this: “All roads lead to God. All beliefs, all truths of light lead to God.” In contrast, Jesus said that there are only two religious roads and that only one of them leads to God’s favor and everlasting life. The other leads <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>to disapproval and everlasting destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>) Clearly, these statements cannot both be true.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Where do the “angels” of “the new spirituality” stand on marriage and morality? In one book the reader learns of Roseann, who was told by her “angel”: “You have many to reach, and being with [your husband] is not where your life’s path is anymore. You love him and he loves you, but it is time to separate.” She got a divorce. Yet, the Bible shows that God hates a divorcing without proper grounds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:16-39:2:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Malachi 2:16</a>) Another story tells of a couple who commit adultery, convinced that the angels look on with rejoicing and surround them with an aura. But the Bible says: “You must not commit adultery.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:14-2:20:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 20:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Could it be that these modern-day messages update the Bible? No, God’s Word does not change. The apostle Paul wrote to some in the first century: “I marvel that you are being so quickly removed from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness over to another sort of good news. But it is not another; only there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to pervert the good news about the Christ. However, even if we or <em>an angel out of heaven </em>were to declare to you as good news something beyond what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:6-48:1:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 1:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“Calling All Angels!”</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Should we call upon angels for help in dealing with problems and dangers in life? This is the topic of many books. Here are two examples. The book <em>Ask Your Angels </em>is said to show readers ‘how they can draw on the power of angels to reconnect with their lost inner selves and to achieve their goals.’ A similar book is <em>Calling All Angels!: 57 Ways to Invite an Angel Into Your Life.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Never, though, does the Bible encourage us to call upon angels. Jesus made this point clear in the model prayer. He said: “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our <em>Father </em>in the heavens . . .’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to <em>God.”</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>In the Name of Angels</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The new spirituality” places great importance on learning the names of angels. Popular books offer the supposed names of thousands of angels. Why? It is not to satisfy idle curiosity; it is to summon them. This is closely associated with magic. The <em>Encyclopedia of Angels </em>states that along with ritual, magical objects, and invocations, “the use of ‘names of power,’ or names of specific spirits, releases powerful vibrations that open the door between the physical realm and the realm of the spirits, enabling the magician to . . . communicate with spirits.” Yet, the Bible states plainly: “You must not practice magic.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:26-3:19:26" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible itself reveals the names of only two faithful angels, Michael and Gabriel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:26" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Luke 1:26</a>) In providing these names, the Bible shows that angels are unique spirit persons. Why were not more names given? Likely the reason was to prevent people from elevating angels to a position of undue honor—something to which the angels themselves do not presume to aspire. Thus, when Jacob asked an angel to reveal his name, the angel refused. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:29-1:32:29" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 32:29</a>) Later, the angel who appeared to Joshua identified himself not by name but as the “prince of the army of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:14-6:5:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joshua 5:14</a>) Similarly, when Samson’s father asked an angel his name, he was told: “Just why should you ask about my name, when it is a wonderful one?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:17-7:13:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judges 13:17, 18</a>) God’s faithful angels want us to honor God and call upon him, not them.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sc"><strong>Modern-Day “Encounters” With Angels and Aliens</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sc">  Many people today claim that they have seen angels and spoken with them. Others say that they have had contact with aliens from other worlds. The book <em>Angels—An Endangered Species </em>lists the similarities between these accounts, claiming that both may have a common explanation.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Following is a summary of some similarities listed in the book.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sm"> <strong>1. </strong>Both angels and aliens come from other worlds.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sm"> <strong>2. </strong>Both are advanced life-forms, either spiritually or technologically.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sm"> <strong>3. </strong>The friendly variety are youthful and beautiful in appearance, and they are kind and full of compassion.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sm"> <strong>4. </strong>Both have little trouble with language, speaking clearly in the language of the listener.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sm"> <strong>5. </strong>Both are masters of flight.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sm"> <strong>6. </strong>Appearances of both angels and aliens are accompanied by brilliant light.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sm"> <strong>7. </strong>Both appear fully dressed, commonly in either robes or close-fitting tunics. White or blue are favorite colors.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sm"> <strong>8. </strong>Both are usually the same height as humans.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sm"> <strong>9. </strong>Both express concern about the plight of humanity and the planet.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sm"><strong>10. </strong>The evidence of both alien and angelic encounters is the testimony of the beholder.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sc"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p>
<div id="fn2" class="fcc"><p id="p41" data-pid="41">The explanation common to both is that wicked spirits, or demons, are evidently behind many such “encounters.” As the Bible says, “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>)—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:101996490/1-9:146"><em>Awake!, </em>July 8, 1996, page 26</a>.</p></div>

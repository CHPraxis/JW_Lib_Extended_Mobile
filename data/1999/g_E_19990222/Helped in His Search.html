<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LIFE is hard for many people throughout the world, and some are searching for the reason why this is so. A 35-year-old man with two children wrote from the city of Grodno, Belarus:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A woman stopped me on the street and offered me the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. I didn’t know what this magazine was about, but since it was attractive in appearance, I took it. When I came home, I looked at the articles, and they caught my interest.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I do not think of myself as a believer. However, in your publication I found reliable answers to many questions that were disturbing me. Our life isn’t easy now, and we especially need the Bible’s help. I would like to ask you to send me more information about God and his teachings. For a long time, I have sought answers to many questions, and your publication has helped me in my search.”</p>

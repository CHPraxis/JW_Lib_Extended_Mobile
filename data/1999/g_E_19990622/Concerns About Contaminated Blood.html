<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN Demetrio Pessoa, a biochemist in Bolivia, ran into complications after surgery, he was rushed to a clinic. There he received a blood transfusion, and his situation stabilized. Before long, however, the biochemist broke out in a fever. After examining him, the doctors told him the bad news: Mr. Pessoa had received blood contaminated with the parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi. </em>As a consequence, he had become a victim of Chagas’ disease.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Mr. Pessoa’s case is no exception in Bolivia, notes Panos, a London-based news organization. A lengthy medical study carried out in 12 Latin-American countries shows that in that part of the world, infections caused by contaminated blood are everyday occurrences. In one Latin-American country, of every 10,000 patients who received a blood transfusion, 220 ended up with an infectious disease. That means that 1 out of every 45 persons given a blood transfusion became a victim!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Chagas’ disease, though, is not the only threat. The same study shows that several Latin-American countries did not test donated blood for hepatitis C and that in some countries tests for syphilis were carried out only occasionally. In addition, a number of countries lacked sufficient equipment to test blood for HIV. When speaking about contaminated blood, Tonchi Marinkovic, the Bolivian minister of health, said: “God save us from an emergency, because we might end up with a medical crisis of syphilis, hepatitis, Chagas’ or AIDS.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Unwittingly, this government official was pointing in the right direction for halting this threatening medical crisis. The journal <em>Notícias Bolivianas </em>noted some years ago in an article on the risks of blood transfusions: “Abstinence from blood is recommended in harmony with the Biblical commandment.” The Biblical command that this Bolivian journal refers to is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:29-44:15:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 15:29</a>. It says: “Keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.”—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:3:17-3:3:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Leviticus 3:17</a>.</p>

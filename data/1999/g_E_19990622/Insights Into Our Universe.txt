Insights Into Our Universe
THAT is what the new book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? provides in its chapter “How Did Our Universe Get Here?—The Controversy.” But it does more. It examines how life began—whether by chance or by creation.
A professor of physics in the United States observed: “The book deals with some of the most outstanding puzzles in astrophysics, molecular biology, and human anatomy, which are hard to explain by chance. It clearly presents the issues involved without getting bogged down by technical detail. The book reasons with the reader and quotes from many leading scientists in various disciplines. This is a ‘must read’ for anyone interested in the origin of the universe and life, either as a scientist or as a layman.”

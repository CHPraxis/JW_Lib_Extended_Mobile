Question Box
▪ Are you prepared for an emergency?
In the modern world, “time and unforeseen occurrence” often combine to create a medical emergency, including pressure to take a blood transfusion. (Eccl. 9:11) So that we can prepare for such an eventuality, Jehovah has provided help in many ways through his organization, but he expects us to do our part. Below is a checklist to help you.
• Carry the current Advance Medical Directive/​Release card at all times.
• See that your children carry the current Identity Card.
• Review the September 1992 Our Kingdom Ministry insert, rehearsing how to reason with doctors and judges regarding treatment for your child.
• Review articles on blood fractions and alternatives to blood. (Recommended: The Watchtower, October 1, 1994, page 31; June 1, 1990, pages 30-1; March 1, 1989, pages 30-1; Awake!, December 8, 1994, pages 23-7; August 8, 1993, pages 22-5; November 22, 1991, page 10; and Our Kingdom Ministry, September 1992 and November 1990 inserts. Keep them in a folder for ready access.)
• Decide conscientiously if you can allow use of machines that circulate blood outside the body or if you can accept products containing blood fractions. (If you complete a health-care durable power of attorney, or proxy, form​—which is advisable—​you will see that provision is made on the form for you to declare your own informed choice of treatment.)
• Before going to the hospital, if at all possible, let the elders know so that they can support you and contact the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) if necessary. In the case of a young child, ask the elders to notify the HLC early.
Make Clear Your Refusal of Blood: Reports show that some brothers and sisters wait until the last minute to tell the treating doctors that they do not want blood. This is unfair to medical personnel and puts you at risk of being transfused. If the doctors know your convictions and your wishes are backed up by signed documents that state your specific directions, it helps them to proceed without delay and often gives them additional options for nonblood medical treatment.
 Since a medical emergency can occur at any time, usually when you least expect it, take steps now to safeguard yourself and your children from a blood transfusion.​—Prov. 16:20; 22:3.

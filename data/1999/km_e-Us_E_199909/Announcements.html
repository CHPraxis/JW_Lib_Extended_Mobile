<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>September: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em><strong>October: </strong>Individual copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. <strong>November: </strong><em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>or <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em><strong>December: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>with the <em>New World Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ When in the ministry, you may meet a person who is deaf. If there is a sign language group or congregation functioning in your area, you should follow the direction provided in the Society’s October 15, 1998, letter to all congregations in the United States. It explains: “The Please Follow Up form will be used to make a note of people, whether in your congregation’s territory or not, who speak another language, <strong><em>including sign language. </em></strong>Generally, it should be used for this purpose even if the individual does not show interest in the Kingdom message. . . . After filling out the Please Follow Up form, it should be given directly to the congregation secretary or placed in the box for field service reports at the Kingdom Hall.” With each publisher being alert to cooperate in this way, sign language congregations will be able to compile a list of deaf people located in their area.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a><em>, </em>regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more persons planning to visit the Society’s facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the Society’s facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The Society will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. LODGING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CONGREGATION ELDERS AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONGREGATION SECRETARY. Before your visit, please review the March 1998 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>Question Box.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ The Society does not fill individual publisher’s requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ The 1998 “God’s Way of Life” District and International Conventions were truly a blessing for all in attendance. Among those present were 2,764 missionaries and international servants who were able to visit their home countries with the aid of generous donations from the congregations. Support of this arrangement is very much appreciated. With the conclusion of these conventions, the remaining funds donated for this purpose will be used to support the worldwide preaching work.</p>

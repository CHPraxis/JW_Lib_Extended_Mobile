<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah is the God of purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 55:10, 11</a>) We are exhorted to imitate him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1</a>) This certainly ought to hold true of the way in which we perform our ministry. So the question is appropriate: “Are you working with a purpose?”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Your preaching from door to door, witnessing informally, and distributing literature is all part of a purposeful ministry. But remember that our commission involves not only preaching but also disciple making. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) After sowing seeds of Kingdom truth, we need to return to water them and provide regular care as we look to Jehovah to bring the increase. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6</a>) We need to be conscientious about making return visits and starting Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Expand Your Ministry: </strong>There is always a good feeling when you can look back on what you did in the service and say to yourself: “I accomplished what I set out to do.” As recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, Paul urged: “Fully accomplish your ministry.” That includes expanding your efforts to follow up on all the interest found. In your weekly service schedule, plan a definite time to make return visits. Work toward the goal of trying to start Bible studies with those inclined toward righteousness. This should be your purpose when sharing in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Ask publishers how they felt when they saw their Bible students get baptized at an assembly. They rejoiced, possibly as much as the ones who got baptized. They had accomplished a grand purpose! One disciple maker expressed it this way: “Making disciples means making more praisers of Jehovah. It means life for those who accept the truth. I just love teaching the truth to others​—it’s so beautiful! . . . Many of those who have come to love Jehovah have become my very dear friends.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Imagine being able to assist a person to become a dedicated servant of Jehovah! What a cause for joy! Such fruitage results from having worked with a purpose in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:17-51:4:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 4:17</a>.</p>

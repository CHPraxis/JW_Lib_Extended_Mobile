They express concern about safeguarding their children from the negative traits that they are exposed to at school, by television, and by non-Witness relatives and others. The brothers consider disrespectful attitudes, worldly speech and grooming, and unwholesome entertainment. After reflecting on the need to set a good example, they discuss ways to build up greater enthusiasm for the family study, the congregation meetings, and field service.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1999482/1-6:389$p/E:1999483/$p/E:1999484/">July 1, 1999, <em>Watchtower, </em>pages 8-22</a>, and <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:101991682/13:258-18$p/E:101991683/">September 22, 1991, <em>Awake!, </em>pages 8-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Make Good Use of the <em>Creator </em>Book. Talk and demonstrations. The April 1999 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>explained that the <em>Creator </em>book may be offered any time we meet people who (1) do not believe in God or (2) believe in God but have no real concept of who he is or what his qualities and purposes are. The thought-provoking questions and comments on the back cover can be used to stimulate interest in reading the book. Or page 152 can be used to good advantage. A publisher might ask: “Where can we find the very best advice on how to solve our most perplexing problems?” He can show the person how noted authorities have praised Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, ask him to choose one of the seven highlighted points that interests him most, and then read a few of the cited verses. Demonstrate both of these suggestions for offering the <em>Creator </em>book, mentioning the donation arrangement in each presentation. Encourage all to carry the book in the field service, being ready to offer it whenever appropriate.</p>

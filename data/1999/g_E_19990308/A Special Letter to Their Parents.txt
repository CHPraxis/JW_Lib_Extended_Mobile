A Special Letter to Their Parents
Two teenage girls in Spain recently wrote a letter of appreciation to their parents. Here are some excerpts:
To our dear parents, Pepe and Vicenta:
Where to begin? There are so many things we want to say, and it’s hard to put it all in a few words. We want to thank you for our 17 and 15 years of life, years that have been full of care and affection.
We have always known your opinions and your rules. Sometimes we wondered why we had to get home at a set time, but now, after observing how things turned out for other young ones who did not have a curfew, we realize that we have been protected by those rules.
Your example in not ever missing a Christian meeting at the Kingdom Hall, except for very good reasons, has helped us a lot, as has preaching with you on Sundays. On Sunday mornings we don’t need to ask if we are going in the field service. We know perfectly well that we are!
Our upbringing has also included learning hospitality. So many have visited our home, and you always give them the best you have. We have seen this with our young eyes, and we have appreciated that we have parents who are special.
There is no one who knows or understands us better than you do. You are our best friends, the ones we trust completely.
In conclusion, we want to say that we love you. You are our parents, and we wouldn’t exchange you for anyone else. If somehow we could choose our parents and our way of life all over again, we would, without a doubt, choose you, and we would live the same life all over again.
With affectionate kisses, your daughters,
ESMERALDA AND YOLANDA

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LET me see the light.” These are the words that the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi reportedly uttered to those attending to him just before his death. The words suggest man’s desperate attachment to life, represented by light.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Attachment to life is a precious impulse that moves most individuals to avoid dangers and to do all they can to keep living. In this, man is not greatly different from the animals, which have a strong survival instinct.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But what kind of life is truly worthy of being lived and loved? It is not mere physiological existence​—just breathing and moving. Nor does general satisfaction come from a get-as-much-out-of-life-as-possible approach. The Epicurean philosophy, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die,” has not brought contentment to people for the most part. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:32-46:15:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>) While man certainly has a number of basic material needs, he also has cultural and social interests, not to mention spiritual needs, tied to faith in a Supreme Being. Sadly, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people enjoy little more than mere existence because of miserable social and environmental conditions in many areas of the globe. Any who limit themselves primarily to satisfying their physical needs​—eating, drinking, having possessions, or gratifying sexual desires—​more or less lead an animal existence, from which they draw scant contentment. In effect, they make no use of the more meaningful resources that life offers to fulfill the human intellect and emotions. Moreover, any who seek to satisfy just their egoistic desires not only fail to get the best out of life but also damage the society in which they live, and they do not promote the interests of others.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Confirming this, a judge who deals with juvenile offenders says that “crises of values, exaltation of negative role models, and success by quick and easy enrichment” tend to “promote an exaggerated spirit of competition.” This leads to behavior that is damaging to society and destructive to youths, especially when they turn to drugs.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You know that life offers many attractions​—vacations in fascinating places, interesting reading or research, pleasant company, beautiful music. And there are other activities that bring satisfaction great and small. Those with a deep faith in God, and particularly in the God of the Bible, Jehovah, have more reasons to love life. True faith is a source of strength and serenity that can help people to deal with difficult <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>times. Believers in the true God can confidently say: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:6-58:13:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:6</a>) People acquainted with God’s love feel loved by him. They respond to his love, drawing deep joy from it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 4:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16</a>) They can lead an active and altruistic life that is a source of satisfaction. It is just as Jesus Christ said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sadly, there is another side to the present life. There are widespread suffering, injustice, poverty, sickness, and death​—to mention just some of the painful features that often make life barely tolerable. The rich, powerful, and wise King Solomon of the ancient nation of Israel lacked none of the resources that can make people happy. Yet, there was something that troubled him​—the realization that at death he would have to leave to someone else all that ‘his hard work,’ performed “with wisdom and with knowledge and with proficiency,” had procured for him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:17-21:2:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:17-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Like Solomon, most are aware of the brevity of life, which slips by all too rapidly. The Scriptures say that God ‘has put eternity into our minds.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>, <em>Byington</em>) This sense of eternity moves man to ponder life’s brevity. In the long run, without finding convincing answers to the meaning of life and death, one can become burdened with feelings of pessimism and futility. This can make life sad.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Are there answers to man’s anguished questions? Will there ever be conditions to make life more attractive and lasting?</p>

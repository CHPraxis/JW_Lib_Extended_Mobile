<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>Any 192-page book published prior to 1985 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer <em>True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>Individual copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Have <em>Require </em>brochure available for interested people, and endeavor to start home Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The insert in this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>regarding the 1999 district convention will be covered in the Service Meeting the week of December 28, 1998.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ All baptized publishers present at the Service Meeting the week of January 4 will be given the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the Identity Card for their children.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 1, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “How Real Is God to You?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Thursday, April 1, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between programs to allow time to greet visitors, encourage newly interested ones, and benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic and parking problems, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 1999 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 18. The subject of the talk will be “True Friendship With God and Neighbor.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 18, 1999.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>

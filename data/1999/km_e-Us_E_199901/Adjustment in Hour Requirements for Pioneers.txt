Adjustment in Hour Requirements for Pioneers
1 All of us appreciate having hardworking regular and auxiliary pioneers in the congregation. Even where the territory is limited and thoroughly worked on a regular basis, the pioneers have set a fine example by their zealous Kingdom service. They have encouraged all the publishers to keep busy in searching for those who are “rightly disposed.”​—Acts 13:48.
2 The Society has observed the mounting difficulties faced by pioneers, especially with regard to finding part-time secular work that will allow them to care adequately for their personal needs so as to remain in the full-time service. The present economic situation in many lands has also made it increasingly difficult for others to enter the pioneer work, even though that is their heartfelt desire. During recent months, these and other factors have been carefully considered.
3 Therefore, in view of the above, the Society has reduced the hour requirement for both regular and auxiliary pioneers. Starting with the 1999 calendar year, the requirement for regular pioneers will be 70 hours each month, or a total of 840 hours for the year. The monthly requirement for auxiliary pioneers will be 50 hours. The hour requirement for special pioneers and missionaries remains unchanged, since provision is made by the Society to help them care for their basic material needs. Thus, they can concentrate more fully on their preaching and disciple-making work.
4 It is hoped that this adjustment in the hour requirements will help more pioneers to hold on to this precious privilege of service. It should also open the way for many more publishers to take up the regular and auxiliary pioneer work. What a blessing this should prove to be for everyone in the congregation!

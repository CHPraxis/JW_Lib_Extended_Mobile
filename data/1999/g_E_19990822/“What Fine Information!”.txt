“What Fine Information!”
How can young people find a purpose in life, understand themselves, or learn to get along well with their parents? Recently, the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain received a letter, which said in part:
“My reason for writing is to congratulate you fervently for the good work you do in publishing marvelous books, such as the one entitled Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. What fine information! I congratulate the writers and publishers, who have fulfilled the dreams of thousands of young people.
“I am a 21-year-old girl who had previously sought out and studied the Bible. . . . Quite by chance, through a friend, the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work came into my possession.
“At first I thought that it would be of no help to me, but little by little, my interest in reading it grew. It made me think about many things, such as what I should do with my life, and gradually it answered my questions. With that treasure in my hands, I learned how to understand my parents, how to forgive, and how to be a woman and act like one.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How can young people find a purpose in life, understand themselves, or learn to get along well with their parents? Recently, the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain received a letter, which said in part:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My reason for writing is to congratulate you fervently for the good work you do in publishing marvelous books, such as the one entitled <em>Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. </em>What fine information! I congratulate the writers and publishers, who have fulfilled the dreams of thousands of young people.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am a 21-year-old girl who had previously sought out and studied the Bible. . . . Quite by chance, through a friend, the book <em>Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work </em>came into my possession.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“At first I thought that it would be of no help to me, but little by little, my interest in reading it grew. It made me think about many things, such as what I should do with my life, and gradually it answered my questions. With that treasure in my hands, I learned how to understand my parents, how to forgive, and how to be a woman and act like one.”</p>

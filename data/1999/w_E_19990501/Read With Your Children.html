<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">According to the Brazilian magazine <em>Veja, </em>children of diligent readers are more likely to develop a fondness for books than are children who lack such an example of reading in the home. “Shared reading reinforces intimacy between parents and children and allows the child to assimilate the books’ contents better,” notes Martha Hoppe, a specialist in child development.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Reading out loud to your children also gives you the opportunity to answer questions. You can discuss any pictures that accompany the text. “The more a child understands the contents of books,” observes Hoppe, “the more he will be stimulated to look for them when he wants to satisfy his curiosity.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many parents among Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy reading with their children. They may read such publications as <em>My Book of Bible Stories, Listening to the Great Teacher, </em>and <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Books like these not only help children to become good readers but also broaden their interest in the world’s best-seller​—the Holy Bible. Therefore, if you are a parent, set the example for your children by being an avid reader of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 1:7, 8</a>) And by all means, take the time to read to them!</p>

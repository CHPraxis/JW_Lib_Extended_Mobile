Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life with the New World Translation. January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1986 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. February: The Secret of Family Happiness. March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies.
▪ Since the Gilead graduation will be held on Saturday, March 11, 2000, no tours will be conducted that day at the Society’s facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York. Any who have planned to visit on that Saturday should reschedule their visit to another convenient time. No congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup that day.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1999 with their December literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ The Memorial for the year 2001 will be on Sunday, April 8, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. An exception will be made if there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk.

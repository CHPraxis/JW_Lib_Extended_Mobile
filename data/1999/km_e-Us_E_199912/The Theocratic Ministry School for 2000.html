<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The Theocratic Ministry School has proved to be a rich blessing to Jehovah’s people. Over the past 50 years, it has helped millions to develop their abilities as public speakers and teachers of Bible truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:10-19:145:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 145:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Can you see how the school has helped you? It can continue to do so during 2000 if you share in it fully and apply the counsel that is given.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Instructions about assignments and the publications that will be used are listed on the first page of the school schedule for 2000. The time allotted for each part, the source material, how the material is to be presented, and other details are considered. Please take the time to read the instructions carefully and apply them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Weekly Bible Reading: </strong>There are two separate programs for weekly Bible reading listed on the school schedule. One is the standard reading program that covers about five pages of the Bible. Bible highlights are based on this reading. The other reading program is supplemental and covers twice as much material. By following this program, you will be able to read the entire Bible in three years. It is understood that some may want to read more than is scheduled in the supplemental program, and others may not be able to keep up with it. Rather than comparing yourself with others, rejoice in what you can accomplish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 6:4</a>) The vital thing is to read God’s Word daily.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>To enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School, you should speak with the school overseer. Please take your assignments seriously, and do not cancel unnecessarily. Appreciate the school as a provision from Jehovah. Prepare well, become thoroughly familiar with the assigned material, and express yourself from the heart, thus benefiting to the full from this unique school.</p>

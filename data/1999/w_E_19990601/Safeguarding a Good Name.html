<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TO STUDY a beautiful painting carefully can be a rewarding experience. Looking closely, one will note how an artist used hundreds of brushstrokes to apply various pigments on a canvas.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Similarly, a good name is developed, not by one broad stroke of a brush, so to speak, but by many small acts over a period of time. Yes, little by little our reputation is built up through the deeds that we perform.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the other hand, one misplaced brushstroke can depreciate a painting’s value. So it is with our name. Wise King Solomon said: “It is the foolishness of an earthling man that distorts his way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:3-20:19:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>) All it takes is a little so-called foolishness​—perhaps a violent outburst of anger, an immoderate indulgence in alcoholic beverages, or one sexually unchaste act—​to sully a fine reputation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:32-20:6:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:17-20:14:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:1-20:20:1" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 20:1</a>) How vital, therefore, that we strive to acquire a good name and work zealously to safeguard it.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:5-66:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 3:5</a>.</p>

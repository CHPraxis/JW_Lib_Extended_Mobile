<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah’s Witnesses have always been interested in Bible prophecy. So we were thrilled to learn that the theme of this year’s district convention would be “God’s Prophetic Word.” We were eager to know what Jehovah had in store for us as “food at the proper time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) He did not disappoint us.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Convention Highlights: </strong>Friday’s keynote address, “Pay Attention to God’s Prophetic Word,” included an enlightening discussion of the transfiguration account. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 17:1-9</a>) It stressed that right now we are on the threshold of the best of times because we are very, very deep into the time of the end, with the new system just ahead! An important way in which we need to pay attention to God’s Word is by reading it regularly. The symposium “Take Delight in Reading God’s Word” provided practical suggestions for making our Bible reading more profitable and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>On Saturday afternoon we reviewed reasons why we should be convinced that we are living in the last days. Can you remember all of these? Sunday morning, Habakkuk’s prophecy came alive as we learned that our day closely resembles his day and that momentous events are soon to come when Jehovah destroys the wicked and saves the righteous. Did you get the point of the Bible drama about Jacob and Esau? We must actively pursue blessings from Jehovah, resisting the spirit of apathy and indifference.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>An Intriguing New Book: </strong>How excited we were to receive the new book, <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>No doubt you are already reading this engrossing publication. The speaker who released it stated: “Except for a few details, all the prophecies in the book of Daniel have been fulfilled.” Does that not underscore the urgency of our times?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The convention program has greatly strengthened our conviction that all of God’s promises that are yet unfulfilled will come true. We are stimulated to keep on declaring to others God’s prophetic word!</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Be Magazine Conscious! State the total number of magazines placed by the congregation last month. How does this compare with the number received from the Society? If there is a large difference, what needs to be done? Invite the audience to comment on the following: (1) Each publisher should order an adequate but appropriate supply. (2) View every Saturday as Magazine Day. (3) Arrange your personal service schedule to include some magazine activity every month. (4) Plan to do more informal witnessing using magazines to start conversations. (5) Take specialized articles to business and professional people who are most likely to be interested in them. (6) Keep an accurate record of placements, and build up a magazine route, returning regularly with the latest issues. (7) Make good use of any older copies of the magazines so that none accumulate. Display the current magazines, and point out articles that are likely to stir interest. Have an adult and a youngster each demonstrate a brief magazine presentation.​—See the September 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.</p>

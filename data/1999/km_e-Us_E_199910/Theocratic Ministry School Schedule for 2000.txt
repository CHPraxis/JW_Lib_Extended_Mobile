Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2000
Instructions
During 2000 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], The Watchtower [w], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], Insight on the Scriptures Volume 2 [it-2], and “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the New World Translation [td] will be the basis for assignments.
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and a brief welcome. There is no need to give a preview of what is on the program. As the school overseer introduces each part, he will mention the subject to be developed. Proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on The Watchtower or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” When based on The Watchtower, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the “All Scripture” book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute talk, followed by a 3- to 5-minute oral review using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used.
The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested by the speaker.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. No theme is necessary. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the New World Translation. The setting may be an informal witness, a return visit, or a home Bible study, and the participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the assigned theme and helps the householder to reason on the scriptures. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. Not the setting but the effective use of the Bible should be given prime consideration.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. The subject for this assignment will be based on a Bible character or on “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the New World Translation. When this assignment is based on a Bible character, source material can be found under the Bible character’s name in Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character​—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of considering a Bible character is to show what can be learned from his example. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts as well as undesirable traits stand as strong warnings to turn Christians away from an improper course. When this part is based on “Bible Topics for Discussion,” the assigned theme should be used, and the student should endeavor to make practical application of the scriptures. A brother or a sister may be given Assignment No. 4. When assigned to a brother, it should always be a talk. When assigned to a sister, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3. Additionally, whenever the theme for Assignment No. 4 is preceded by #, it should preferably be assigned to a brother.
*SUPPLEMENTAL BIBLE-READING SCHEDULE: This is set forth in brackets after the song number for each week. By following this schedule, reading about ten pages a week, the entire Bible can be read in three years. No parts on the school program or the written review are based on the supplemental reading schedule.
NOTE: For additional information and instruction regarding counsel, timing, written reviews, and the preparation of assignments, please see page 3 of the October 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry.

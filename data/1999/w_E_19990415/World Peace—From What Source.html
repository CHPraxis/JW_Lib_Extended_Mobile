<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WILL globalization of education and religion bring world peace? This is the dream of Dr. Robert Muller, former assistant secretary-general of the United Nations and recipient of the 1989 UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. As reported in <em>The Vancouver Sun </em>newspaper, Dr. Muller is “convinced all the globe’s students must be taught a core set of facts and values about the planet, humanity and non-violence.” He envisions the day when around the world all institutions for learning will teach children about the UN as the best hope for peace. He also believes that “all the world’s religions should become members of a fledgling UN-like organization called the United Religions,” reported the <em>Sun. </em>Then “all religious teaching will promote non-violence.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Will world peace ever become a reality? Most assuredly! But not by means of any human agency. More than 2,700 years ago, an inspired penman identified the superior source of education for peace when he foretold that righthearted people would be “taught by Jehovah,” and their peace would be “abundant.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God is the one “who gives peace,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>) Even now a marvelous global education program is under way as Jehovah instructs his people to “seek peace and pursue it,” to “beat their swords into plowshares,” and not to “learn war anymore.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:11-60:3:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isaiah 2:2-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Worship that is founded on truth, free from hypocrisy and deceit, is approved and blessed by God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 15:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 4:23, 24</a>) Only true worship, in full harmony with God’s Word, can produce people who live in peace and unity and who have genuine love for one another.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>.</p>

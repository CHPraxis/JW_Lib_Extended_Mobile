<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WOULD you not view such a venture as ill-timed, foolish, and potentially disastrous? Some, however, thrust themselves into such a situation in a figurative way. How so? The 17th-century English author Thomas Fuller said: “Act nothing in a furious passion. It’s putting to sea in a storm.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Pursuing a course of action while in a state of unrestrained anger can have tragic consequences. This is borne out by an event recorded in the Bible. Simeon and Levi, sons of the ancient patriarch Jacob, reacted to the violation of their sister Dinah by storming forth in a vengeful rage. The result was wholesale murder and plunder. It is no wonder that Jacob condemned their wicked deed, saying: “You have brought ostracism upon me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:25-1:34:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 34:25-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Wisely, God’s Word, the Bible, recommends the opposite course. It says: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8</a>) Following that advice can prevent great sins.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:10:4-21:10:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:24-20:22:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year we all rejoiced to receive the book <em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>It is a book uniquely designed for those who, although well educated in secular matters, may not believe in God. This book fills an ever-increasing need.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For practical reasons the monthly literature offer usually features publications that have wider appeal. Does this mean that we should refrain from offering the <em>Creator </em>book? Not at all! This book may be offered at any time throughout the year to individuals who do not believe in God and who may benefit from it. It may also be offered to individuals who believe in God but have no real concept of who he is or what his qualities and purposes are. So you are encouraged to carry a copy in your witnessing bag and be ready to offer it to anyone you think will be interested in reading it.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you ever gone to a meeting for field service and discovered that you had no magazines in your witnessing bag? Well, recall the September 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert entitled “Make the Best Use of Our Magazines.” It told us to “have a definite magazine order,” stating: “Place a realistic order with the brother handling magazines for a definite number of copies of each issue. In this way, you and your family will have a regular and adequate supply of magazines.” Have you done this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Why not place a standing order for magazines? You will feel a greater responsibility to distribute the magazines week by week, and you will experience increased joy in doing so. If you already have a standing order, reevaluate whether you are obtaining the amount that you need for an average month in the ministry. Of course, we want to be faithful in picking up our order every week and should feel an obligation to do so. If you are going to be away from the congregation for an extended time, let the magazine servant know whether you want him to release your magazines to someone else until you return.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The same insert quoted above also said that we should “schedule a regular magazine day.” Can you support the weekly Magazine Day? As shown on the <em>1999 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>this is every Saturday of the year! Do not underestimate the importance of distributing <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>When we make an effort to share fully in magazine activity, we are “bringing good news of something better” to our neighbors.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 52:7</a>.</p>

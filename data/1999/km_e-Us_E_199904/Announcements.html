<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories may be worked by special pioneers or are accessible to nearby congregations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 1999 in Chinese, English, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. Cards will be shipped in lots of 25, according to the size of each congregation. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregations, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). Plastic badge card holders may be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the Society to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the secretary should complete and send a Presiding Overseer/​Secretary Change of Address (S-29) form to the Society promptly. This includes any changes in area codes.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the following pioneer forms: Regular Pioneer Changes (S-204), Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205), Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b), and Notification for Discontinuing Regular Pioneer Service (S-206). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Review the regular pioneer application form to make sure it is complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it.</p>

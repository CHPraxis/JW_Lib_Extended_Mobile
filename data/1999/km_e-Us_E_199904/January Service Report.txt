An all-time peak of 78,034 regular pioneers was reached in January! Additionally, 28,903 enrolled as auxiliary pioneers​—the highest number ever reported in the month of January. The reduced hour requirement for regular and auxiliary pioneers, announced in the January 1999 Our Kingdom Ministry, has made it possible for many of Jehovah’s dedicated people to seize the opportunity to have a greater share in the Kingdom-preaching work.

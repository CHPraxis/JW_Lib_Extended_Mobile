<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What could be more heartwarming than seeing husbands and wives, parents and children working together in the Christian ministry, publicly praising the name of Jehovah? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>) All families should have a good routine for regular participation in the field service. Does your family have a set day each week to spend in the ministry? If so, then everyone knows exactly what to plan for and can have a full share.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5a</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In advance of a family service day, why not make it a joint project to prepare the presentations that your family will use? Practice sessions can be most helpful, and they can engender a true spirit of family cooperation. How rewarding it is when the field ministry is a family affair and all members are well prepared!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>A traveling overseer accompanied an entire family in the magazine activity. While he was working from house to house with one of the daughters, she inquired: “How long are you going to work with me?” Then she explained that she was going to work with her father next. It was obvious that she and her father really enjoyed their service together. What a fine family spirit!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Some families may be able to auxiliary pioneer together one month during the year. Or it may be possible for at least one member of the family to serve continuously as an auxiliary pioneer or even to enroll as a regular pioneer. With good organization and cooperation, perhaps all members of the household would be able to increase their personal share in the service by giving support to the one who is pioneering. The family will certainly be blessed by this increased activity and by the good experiences that are enjoyed in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mal. 3:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Having a full share in the evangelizing work will help keep families close, zealous, productive, and happy in Jehovah’s service!​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 2:1, 2</a>.</p>

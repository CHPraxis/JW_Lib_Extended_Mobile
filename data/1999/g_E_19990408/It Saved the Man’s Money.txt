It Saved the Man’s Money
While traveling by taxi between cities in Nigeria, West Africa, a man discussed with a fellow traveler “Practices That God Hates,” a lesson found in the brochure What Does God Require of Us? When the taxi stopped at a restaurant, the man who had taken a keen interest in the brochure pointed to a package he was carrying and explained: “It is money. . . . I took it from one of the traveling bags in the back of the taxi.”
However, the man who had taken the money was now sorry for what he had done and wanted to return the money to its owner. The package was identified by a young merchant, a fellow traveler, as being his. It contained 150,000 naira (about $1,700). The thief, who had been trailing his victim for 300 miles [500 km], told the merchant that he should thank the one who had considered with him the information found in the brochure. It was that information, he explained, that caused him to return the money.
When the driver and the other passengers learned what had occurred, they were amazed, and they all wanted copies of the brochure. The merchant had never previously allowed the Witnesses to speak to him, but now he wanted a Bible study.

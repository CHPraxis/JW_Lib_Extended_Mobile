<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The evening before he died, Jesus passed a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of wine to his apostles and instructed them to eat and to drink. He also told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>.</p>

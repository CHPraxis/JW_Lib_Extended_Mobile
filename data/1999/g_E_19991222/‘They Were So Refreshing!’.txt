‘They Were So Refreshing!’
RECENTLY the general manager of a hotel located near one of the international airports in Japan visited the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ebina. He seemed quite excited. Why?
During 1998, over 200 Witnesses stayed at the manager’s hotel on their way to and from their international conventions in Africa, Australia, Korea, and North America. When the service staff of the hotel had a meeting to review the activities of the past year, they commented that of the hotel’s 30,000 annual guests, these convention delegates were the most impressive they had served.
Therefore, the hotel manager traveled to Ebina to express appreciation. ‘Those guests,’ he said, ‘were very polite and left their rooms clean and tidy. They often expressed their appreciation. Moreover, they provided words of encouragement from the Bible. They were so refreshing!’
The manager continued: ‘We see many guests who are troubled. So we have been looking for some helpful information for them. We would like them to benefit from the Bible’s teaching because it exerts a positive influence on the lives of people.’
As a result, the manager requested 80 sets of a number of publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses so that he could place them in the hotel rooms. Among the publications requested was the 192-page book The Secret of Family Happiness.

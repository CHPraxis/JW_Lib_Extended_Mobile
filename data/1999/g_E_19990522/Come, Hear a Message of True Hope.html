<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">YOU will hear such a message in the public discourse “Making All Things New—As Foretold,” which will be featured at the “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses this year. Many people hope that the year 2000 will usher in blessings for humankind.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The millennium means that we can wash our hands of a really terrible century,” noted one university professor. And although “the year 2000 may be just another year on the calendar,” <em>Maclean’s </em>magazine said, “it could happen to coincide with a truly new beginning.” Experience would suggest, however, that this is unlikely.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Human efforts to bring a “new beginning” have invariably failed. Why, then, can we believe the promise of God made more than 1,900 years ago, “Look! I am making all things new”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>) Convincing reasons will be given in this heartwarming public talk. You may listen to it at a nearby location, for beginning this month, it will be delivered at hundreds of conventions throughout the world.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally, or write to the publishers of this magazine for the location of the convention nearest you. The February 15, 1999, issue of our companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>lists the addresses of all convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Hello. My name is Amelia, and I live on an island in the Caribbean. I am seven years old. Some time ago my poor parents handed me over to a rich family living in the city.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Today, like every day, I got up at five o’clock in the morning. I fetched water from a nearby well. It was very difficult to balance the heavy jug on my head, but I made it—otherwise, I would have been beaten badly. Then I prepared breakfast and served it to the family. I was a little late in serving breakfast, so the master beat me with a leather strap.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">Afterward, I walked the family’s five-year-old son to school. Next, I helped prepare and serve the family’s lunch. Between mealtimes, I had to buy food in the market, run errands, tend the charcoal fire, sweep the yard, wash clothes and dishes, and clean the kitchen. I also washed my lady’s feet. Today she was very upset about something, and she slapped me in anger. I hope that tomorrow she feels better.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">I was given leftovers to eat—at least they were better than the cornmeal I ate yesterday. My clothes are ragged, and I have no shoes. My owners have never allowed me to bathe in the water I bring to the family. Last night I slept outside; sometimes they let me sleep inside on the floor. Too bad I could not write this myself. I am not allowed to go to school.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa">Have a nice day. Amelia.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">ALTHOUGH her real name is not Amelia, her plight is real.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Amelia is just one of the millions of children who must work—often under the worst conditions. Child labor is a major challenge of our times. It is a complex issue with no simple solutions. Massive in scale, corrosive to society, and fatal in its consequences, it is cruel to children and insulting to human dignity.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How extensive is child labor? What are the roots of this problem, and in what shapes does it come? Will there ever be a time when children—the most tender and vulnerable segment of the human family—no longer are subjected to a life of misery and exploitation?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MANAGER of a public library in Prague, Czech Republic, put a two-page evaluation of <em>Awake! </em>on an information board in the library. Among the things he wrote were the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I am neither a devoted supporter nor a deep-rooted opposer of the Watch Tower Society. Nevertheless, I cannot but warmly recommend the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, which I have been reading for a while. Just reading its title once a day would greatly benefit you. However, not only the title but the very contents of this magazine are a fine supplement to commercial magazines . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>“Awake! </em>has a well-thought-out concept. It offers articles on topics that other magazines are reluctant to publish for various reasons. It points to implications, educates in global consciousness . . . <em>Awake! </em>does not judge. It offers facts and the views of authorities, shows pros and cons, confronts current problems with Bible quotations, and leaves the reader to judge for himself. Moreover, <em>Awake! </em>asks—and teaches the readers to ask—questions.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On page 4 of each magazine, the section “Why <em>Awake! </em>Is Published” explains: “Most important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You will find this promise of God discussed in the final two sections of the 32-page brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>These sections are entitled “God’s Purpose Soon to Be Realized” and “Live Forever on a Paradise Earth.” You can receive this brochure by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

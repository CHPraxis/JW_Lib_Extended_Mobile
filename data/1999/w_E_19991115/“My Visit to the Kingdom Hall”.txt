“My Visit to the Kingdom Hall”
Laura,a a college student, was assigned to attend a religious service and write a report about her experience. She chose Jehovah’s Witnesses, and she entitled her essay “My Visit to the Kingdom Hall.” What did Laura find different about the Witnesses? Among the many things she mentioned were the following.
Children: “All the children were in the same room as the adults. In all the churches that I have attended, the children leave their parents and have to attend Sunday School.”
Racial harmony: “Usually, churches draw in members of a certain race or ethnic group. . . . Yet, the Jehovah’s Witnesses were all sitting together and not in certain cliques.”
A welcoming spirit: “Many people came and spoke to me. . . . Some even asked me if I was studying the Bible with anyone. Yet, I did not feel that they were pressuring me. They . . . left the decision to me.”
No collections: “One thing that really surprised me was the fact that nobody took an offering. . . . The churches that I’ve been to even took offerings in the children’s classes.”
There are nearly 90,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide. Why not visit the one nearest you?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">REVELATION 14:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 1. While Jehovah’s Witnesses believe in the inspiration of the book Apocalypse, why are they not an “apocalyptic sect”?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">CONTRARY to the accusations against them, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not an “apocalyptic sect” or a “doomsday cult.” They do, however, accept the Apocalypse, or book of Revelation, as part of the inspired Word of God. True, Revelation does contain judgment messages against the wicked. But in their public witnessing, God’s servants focus mainly on the wonderful hope set out in the Bible, including that in the Apocalypse, or Revelation. Thus, they do not add to or take anything away from the prophetic words found therein.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:18-66:22:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 22:18, 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. What are some scriptures that Jehovah’s Witnesses often use in their preaching work?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>An often cited Scriptural basis for the public ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses is Jesus’ statement: “This good news of the kingdom will be heralded in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>, footnote) And what is “this good news of the kingdom”? Many Witnesses would answer by quoting verses from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation chapters 20 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:27" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21</a> that refer to the Thousand Year Reign of Christ and his Kingdom government and the human society, where death, mourning, and pain will be “no more.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 21:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. To what mission does the public ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses correspond?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As heralds of these glad tidings, Jehovah’s Witnesses are really the mouthpiece of a symbolic heavenly messenger whose mission is also described in Revelation. “I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6</a>) The “everlasting good news” includes the announcement that “the kingdom [or, rulership] of the world” has “become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” and that Jehovah’s “appointed time” has come “to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:17-66:11:18" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>) Is that not truly good news?</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The opening chapter of the book of Revelation presents Jehovah as “the Alpha and the Omega, . . . the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.” And it presents his Son, Jesus Christ, as “the Faithful Witness,” “the firstborn from the dead,” and “the Ruler of the kings of the earth.” It also speaks of Jesus as “him that loves us and that loosed us from our sins by means of his own blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:5-66:1:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:8-66:1:8" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 8</a>) Thus, from the outset, Revelation expounds fundamental life-saving truths. “Those who dwell on the earth” will not benefit from the glad tidings brought to them unless they recognize the sovereignty of Jehovah, put faith in the shed blood of Jesus, and believe that Jehovah resurrected him and that Christ is now earth’s God-appointed Ruler.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:6-19:2:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5. In what role is Christ depicted in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:29" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Re chapters 2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:1-66:3:22" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 3</a> of Revelation?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The next two chapters depict Christ Jesus as the loving heavenly Overseer of the congregations of his disciples on earth. The scroll addressed to a selection of seven Christian congregations that existed in Asia Minor in the first century C.E. contained encouragement and firm counsel that still apply today. The messages sent to the congregations usually begin with such words as “I know your deeds” or “I know your tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:2-66:2:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 2:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:9-66:2:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Yes, Christ knew exactly what was going on in the congregations of his disciples. He commended some for their love, faith, labor in the ministry, endurance, and faithfulness to his name and word. Others he reproved because they had let their love for Jehovah and his Son cool off, or they had lapsed into sexual immorality, idolatry, or apostate sectarianism.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 6. What does the vision recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:1-66:4:11" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Re chapter 4</a> help people to understand?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:1-66:4:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Re Chapter 4</a> provides an awe-inspiring vision of the heavenly throne of Jehovah God. It offers a glimpse of the glory of Jehovah’s presence and of the heavenly ruling structure he will use. The crowned rulers, whose thrones encircle the central throne of the universe, do obeisance to Jehovah and proclaim: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7. (a) What does the angel summon earth’s inhabitants to do? (b) What is an important part of our educational work?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Does this mean something to people today? <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>It certainly does. If they want life under the Millennial Kingdom, they must heed what the “angel flying in midheaven” proclaims: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6, 7</a>) One of the main purposes of the Bible educational work carried out by Jehovah’s Witnesses is to help “those who dwell on the earth” to know and worship Jehovah, recognize his Creatorship, and willingly submit to his righteous sovereignty.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The following two <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:1-66:5:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Re chapters, 5 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:17" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6</a>, present Jesus Christ as a Lamb found worthy to open a scroll with seven seals, thus revealing in symbolic language the events occurring in our day. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>.) To this symbolic Lamb, heavenly voices say: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10</a>) This vision teaches that on the basis of Christ’s shed blood, certain humans of all origins are called to be with him in heaven and “rule as kings over the earth.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:5-66:1:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 1:5, 6</a>.) Their limited number is revealed later in Revelation.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In another vision, Christ is presented as the crowned rider of a white horse, going forth “conquering and to complete his conquest.” Happily, he will conquer the evil effects symbolized by the three other horsemen of the Apocalypse, whose furious ride has brought war, famine, and death to mankind since the pivotal year 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 6:1-8</a>) The unique role of Christ, the Lamb of God, in the salvation of mankind and in the outworking of Jehovah’s wonderful purposes is a principal theme of the Bible-teaching work of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Re Chapter 7</a> contains glad tidings indeed. Only in the book of Revelation do we find the number of those whom Jesus called the “little flock” to whom the Lamb’s Father gives the Kingdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:21, 22</a>) The apostle John, who received the Revelation, attests: “I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4</a>) This precise number is confirmed in a later chapter as being the total of those “bought from among mankind” to rule with the Lamb on the heavenly Mount Zion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1-4</a>) While the churches of Christendom give vague and unconvincing explanations of this number, interestingly, Bible scholar E. W. Bullinger says of it: “It is the simple statement of fact: a <em>definite </em>number in contrast with the <em>indefinite </em>number in this very chapter.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>To what indefinite number was Bullinger referring? In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Re 7 verse 9</a>, the apostle John wrote: “After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>) Who compose this great crowd, what is their <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>present standing before God, and what does the future hold for them? The apocalyptic answer is good news for earth dwellers. We read: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Through faith in Christ’s shed blood, they will be protected during “the great tribulation.” Christ “will guide them to fountains of waters of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14-17</a>) Yes, millions of people living today can become part of the innumerable crowd that will survive the end of the present wicked system of things. As subjects of the King Jesus Christ during his Millennial Reign, they will be guided by him to everlasting life on earth. Is that not good news?</p>

These judgments will be executed, first against false religion (“Babylon the Great”), then against the ungodly political systems, symbolized by wild beasts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 17:5-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:15-66:17:16" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 15, 16</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>These chapters portray the cleansing of the heavens, with Satan and his demons being cast down to the vicinity of the earth.

This is the only part of the Bible that actually mentions a thousand-year period that will be the prelude to an eternity of happiness in heaven and on earth. The churches of Christendom have rejected the Millennial hope. Since church dogma has it that the righteous go to heaven and the wicked to hell, it has no place for a paradise earth. The model prayer, which asks that God’s “will be done on earth as it is in heaven,” has lost all meaning for most members of Christendom’s churches. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>, <em>New International Version</em>) But that is not true of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

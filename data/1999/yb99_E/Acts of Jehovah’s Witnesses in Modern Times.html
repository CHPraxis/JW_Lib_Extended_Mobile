<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Germany</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus Christ told his followers: “Because you are no part of the world, . . . on this account the world hates you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>) Read for yourself what that has meant for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany. As you do, you will see how, despite hatred, they have been able to do a work that has greatly benefited people of many lands.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Malawi</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Located in the southeastern part of Africa, Malawi is a land of much natural beauty. Its people in general are friendly and eager to help. But there was a time, not long ago, when Jehovah’s Witnesses in Malawi were subjected to treatment that shocked the world. The record of their faithful endurance provides a remarkable example of integrity under adversity.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Uruguay</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Most Uruguayans do not view religion as a major concern in life. Yet, for 75 years Jehovah’s Witnesses have been zealously telling them about the opportunity to become wholesome subjects of God’s Kingdom. More than 10,000 have accepted the invitation. During just the past 20 years, the number giving this vital witness in Uruguay has more than doubled.</p>

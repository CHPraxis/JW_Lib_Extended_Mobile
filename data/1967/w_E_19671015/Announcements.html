<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Throughout the world the doctrine of evolution is taught as established fact. The origin of life and man is almost always presented in evolutionary terms in studies of science, philosophy, history and even religion. But does this doctrine really harmonize with the facts of science? What do you personally know about it? Read the 192-page hardbound book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>It bears directly on your life and future. Send only 25c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Freedom is a prized possession. Those who are spiritually free want to help others to be released from captivity to superstitions and false religious traditions. Jehovah’s witnesses strongly feel this way, for they recognize the symbolic Babylon the Great of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 18:2</a> as being the world empire of false religion, to which millions of persons are imprisoned. As Jehovah’s witnesses preach a release to Babylon’s captives during the month of October, they are offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three booklets, for $1.</p>

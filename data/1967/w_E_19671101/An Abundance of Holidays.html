<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Probably there is not a year that goes by in which you do not have your schedule or activities interrupted by some holiday you forgot. Had you lived in ancient Rome during the days of Julius Caesar your problems with an overabundance of holidays would have been worse. In the 40’s B.C.E. the Romans had over one hundred holidays each year, often involving religious offerings and sacrifices. How the hardworking Christians must have stood in contrast after 33 C.E., since the only day during the year that they celebrated was the annual observance of Christ’s death!.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>.</p>

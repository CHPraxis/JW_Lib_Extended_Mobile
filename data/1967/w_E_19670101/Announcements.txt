FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their ministry in an organized way, under the direction of their Fine Shepherd and Jehovah’s Principal Servant, Jesus Christ. In harmony with Jesus’ own instructions, those in the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses who take the lead are not an exalted clergy class, but the servants of their Christian brothers. Together, as a united group, they cooperate in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. During January they will be doing this from house to house by offering to interested persons this Bible magazine, The Watchtower, which, as its front cover shows, is devoted to “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” A year’s subscription, along with three Bible booklets, will be offered for $1.
ARE YOU GATHERED TO THE RIGHT HAND?
Did you know that Jehovah’s judgments are filling the earth in our day? All individuals are being gathered to the right hand of favor of his King-Son or are being abandoned at his left for destruction. Those who have received favorable estimate are commissioned to share in the program of proclaiming Jehovah’s judgment message. You will want to know how far this dividing work has progressed and what still lies ahead for us. Send for the report of worldwide activity of Jehovah’s witnesses as contained in the 1967 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Send for the 1967 calendar colorfully depicting the response to Jesus’ call for preachers. Yearbook, 50c; calendar, 25c. Send today.

A WISE CHOICE IN READING
In spite of the growing popularity of “picture” magazines and newspapers and the demands of television on leisure time, there is still a mass of reading material vying for attention. All this highlights the great need for reading material that is healthful food for the mind. As never before all persons need to know what is the truth concerning God’s purpose for mankind. The book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” meets that need. Send today and receive free a timely booklet on a Bible subject. Send only 50c.
FIELD MINISTRY
The Holy Bible emphasizes the need for keeping useful habits. (1 Cor. 15:33) To help others cultivate and keep the good habits that God approves, Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their ministry from door to door. In their field ministry they offer Bible literature that promotes fine habits such as prayer, the putting of God’s kingdom first in one’s life and the regular study of the Holy Scriptures. Such literature also stresses the right kind of association that is needed to keep these good habits. To help all interested persons find the happiness that comes from keeping divinely approved habits, Jehovah’s witnesses are offering during the month of August the Bible-study aid Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Son’s of God and a booklet, for just 50c.

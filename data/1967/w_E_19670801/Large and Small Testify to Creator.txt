Large and Small Testify to Creator
The power of the Creator, as well as his wisdom, can be seen in the large and in the small. (Rom. 1:20) The visible universe is so large and contains so many heavenly bodies that man cannot see the end of them with the most powerful telescopes. Nor can he see the smallest particles within the core of the atom, even with the most advanced microscopes. In regard to smallness, scientists have estimated that if all the hereditary material, the chromosomes, needed to produce all the people living today (more than 3,000,000,000!) were brought together, the amount of it would add up to less bulk than an aspirin tablet.​—Heredity, Race and Society, by L. C. Dunn and T. Dobzhansky.

FIELD MINISTRY
Freedom is a prized possession. Those who are spiritually free want to help others to be released from captivity to superstitions and false religious traditions. Jehovah’s witnesses strongly feel this way, for they recognize the symbolic Babylon the Great of Revelation 18:2 as being the world empire of false religion, to which millions of persons are imprisoned. As Jehovah’s witnesses preach a release to Babylon’s captives during the month of October, they are offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for Awake! magazine, with three booklets, for $1.
PROOF OF POPULARITY
Each year the magazine Awake! has more readers. Are you one of them? Its current circulation of 4,550,000 is almost double what it was ten years ago, and the total of twenty six languages in which it appears is almost twice what it was then. Have you discovered what it is that accounts for this growing popularity? Read Awake! regularly and be better informed as well as stimulated and refreshed. Send for a year’s subscription. It is only $1. Send now and receive three free Bible study booklets.

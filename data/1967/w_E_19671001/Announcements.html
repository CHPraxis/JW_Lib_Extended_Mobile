<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Freedom is a prized possession. Those who are spiritually free want to help others to be released from captivity to superstitions and false religious traditions. Jehovah’s witnesses strongly feel this way, for they recognize the symbolic Babylon the Great of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:2-66:18:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 18:2</a> as being the world empire of false religion, to which millions of persons are imprisoned. As Jehovah’s witnesses preach a release to Babylon’s captives during the month of October, they are offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three booklets, for $1.</p>

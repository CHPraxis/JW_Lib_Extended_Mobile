<p><span class="font24">W</span><span class="font21">HEREVER you go in the larger cities and towns you are almost sure to encounter evidences of vandalism, damage and defacement of public and private property. Who are the major offenders? Youths and children. But whose children? If you are a parent, how sure are you that your children are not among the vandals? Right now, do you know what your children are doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Faced as we are with steadily worsening conditions in all lands, this is surely no time for parents to lose track of the whereabouts and the doings of their youngsters. Unsupervised juveniles are responsible for a great deal of lawlessness. Nor are their actions limited to vandalism. Tragic fires have been started by little children. And sadistic cruelties have been practiced by them. A considerable percentage of fatal accidents on the highways are traceable to teen-age folly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Pointing up the vital responsibility of parents in this regard was the near-tragedy in a Toronto, Ontario, park where a five-year-old boy was kicked, beaten and his hair set on fire by an older Ijoy and a girl who fled when park officials responded to the little fellow’s screams. What about the parents of the five-year-old? Do they customarily allow him to roam around unattended? To what extent do you keep track of your young ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Even when such a case is reported in the news, how many parents questioned their own children as to their whereabouts at the time of this vicious attack? Is it possible that most fathers and mothers just concluded that their children would never be involved in anything like that? Even under ordinary conditions, how many parents care enough to require of their children an account of time spent beyond the supervision of the home? Accountability is something that has a healthy effect on adults as well as children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Then there was the heart-rending case reported in the San Antonio (Texas) </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Ex-press/News</span><span class="font21"> of February 4, 1967, of a fifteen-year-old girl who became pregnant, kept it secret, brought the child to birth unaided in the bathroom of her own home, and then left the infant to die of exposure in a vacant lot. How could it happen? Parents would have to be blind and deaf or just completely indifferent in order to be deceived in such a manner. What about your children? Are you closer to them than that? Do you know what they are doing with their time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Parents who live in a good neighborhood may treat the matter of child supervision lightly because they feel that children who are well fed and clothed and supplied with spending money have no reason for delinquent behavior. However, a well-known sociologist is reported in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &lt;£ World Report,</span><span class="font21"> April 26, 1965, as saying: &quot;Delinquency seems to be rising in the suburban areas, and the causes for it, we think, are basically the same that you find in the slum areas.’’ And what are those causes? Lack of parental supervision is the outstanding one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It is often too late when some parents awaken to the full sense of their responsibility. Consider, for example, this headline that appeared in the New York </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font21">of April 7, 1967: &quot;Parents Win $130,000 in Car Crash Fatal to Son.” The circumstances of this case are worthy of special notice. Tire dead youth had been a passenger in a car driven by his school chum, the car belonging to his chum’s father. The driver of the other car having been absolved of responsibility, the bereaved parents sued the chum and his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In one family they were mourning a son, while the other family faced financial ruin. Did the parents act in the best interest of their family by letting their boy have the keys of the car? Did they really know their own boy, or just think they did? Did the parents know where the boys were going with the car? Did they bother to check on the associations of their children? Too often the decisions are left to the immature judgment of youth, and too much confidence is placed in the ability of young people to stay out of trouble.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Future: Disaster or Prosperity?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">Many are the parents who are conscious of the need to protect their children from others, and this is commendable. But it is only part of their responsibility. As author Henry G. Felsen rightly says in his booklet </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Understanding Our Teen-Agers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“As parents, we have a dual responsibility with regard to our children. We are responsible for protecting them from harm, and we are also responsible for protecting the community from them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Only when their children are caught in some delinquent act do some parents realize that they have a child who is a bully, or a vandal or a speedster on the highway. In fact, their own children are measurably strangers to them, persons they see briefly at mealtimes or other special occasions. The rude awakening comes because they did not constantly inquire, “What are my children doing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">How beneficial, then, for parents to examine their actual relationship with their children. Is fond indulgence substituted for firm leadership? Is permissiveness the rule, rather than accountability? Godly parents will heed the Bible's counsel at Proverbs 13:24: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.” The ‘rod of discipline’ may not always be the literal rod, but surely it should involve that proper degree of supervision that demonstrates genuine love for the child, that guards the child from bad associations and bad conduct. &quot;What is my child doing?” is a matter of constant concern on the part of the loving parent.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:420pt;height:155pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">There are many changes that you no doubt would like to see in this order, that is, this framework of surroundings and conditions that has been built up on this earth and of which the world of mankind is an inseparable part. If you had the power, what would you do to make this a more desirable order in which to live? What improvements would you effect? In what kind of order* would you like to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In the introduction of their book, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">A Sane and Happy Life: A Family Guide,</span><span class="font21"> Doctors Abraham and Rose Franzblau made the interesting observation: “If we were to take a poll of the world population and consult humanity on the kind of world we would all like to live in, it is very likely that we could all agree on certain minimum requirements.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">These doctors listed a total of eight essential requirements for an order in which all normal humans would agree that they would like to live. Politicians, doctors and scientists of this system of things have been unsuccessful in achieving these essentials for the blessing of humankind. Interestingly, however, the basic wholesome desires of mankind are the very things that God purposes to provide under the rule of his kingdom. Consider, for example, the requirements listed by these doctors in comparison with the promises of God's Word the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“World Without</span><span class="font21"> War”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This was the first one they listed. Certainly we can all agree with that essential! O how the world of mankind longs to be free from bloodshed, brutality and violence! Yet today over 130 thousand million dollars a year are spent on stockpiling weapons of war. What horrible suffering and distress these are now bringing to millions of men, women and children in Vietnam and elsewhere! The threat of nuclear war causes others to live in dreadful fear, and not without reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet, the promise of man’s Creator, Jehovah God, is that he will soon intervene, and “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” (Rev. 11:18) The assurance of His Word is: “Evildoers themselves will be cut off . . . But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—Ps. 37:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">God knows of man’s desire for peace, and we can confidently look forward to his taking action by means of his kingdom to end all wars, as promised: “He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons he bums in the fire.&quot; (Ps. 46:9) In that peaceful, warless order of God’s making, the prophecy of Micah 4:3, 4 will also work out in a literal way: &quot;They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war any more. And they will actually sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and there will be no one making them tremble.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Is that not the kind of order in which you would like to live? If it really is, then it is urgent that you learn more about the One who will bring it to pass, Jehovah God. Only the powerful Creator, and not mere humans, can usher in such blessings. But there are other essentials necessary in order to make life truly enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">A World with Plenty</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Second, it would be a world without</span><span class="font19"> HUNGER, FROM WHICH FAMINE AND WANT WOULD BE BANISHED FOREVER.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Anyone familiar with the gnawing pangs of hunger will readily agree that this is a vital requirement for happiness. Lack of nutritious food is what makes life so miserable for hundreds of millions of persons today. The Director General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported a few years back that &quot;up to half of the world’s population, 1,500 millions, suffer from hunger or malnutrition or both.” Even richer countries are affected. The late President John F. Kennedy reportedly said: &quot;The facts are that seventeen million Americans go to bed hungry every night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Although fulfilling this essential presents an insurmountable problem for men today, Jehovah God will satisfy man’s desire for good things to eat under his kingdom in the hands of Christ. His promise is: “The earth itself will certainly give its produce. . . . There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth.” (Ps. 67:6; 72:16) No one will be lacking fine food. All will enjoy a sumptuous feast of both spiritual and physical things, as the Bible prophecy assures: “Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples, in this mountain, a banquet of well-oiled dishes, a banquet of wine kept on the dregs, of well-oiled dishes filled with marrow.”—Isa. 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Would you enjoy living when Jehovah God supplies plenty of food for all mankind? If so, it is now vital to appreciate your spiritual need, for, as Jesus Christ explained: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah's mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) These sayings of God constitute spiritual food. We must first take in this food if we are to enjoy the fulfillment of God’s promises of physical plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But besides peace and plenty, what other basic requirement could we all agree upon as an essential for the kind of order in which we would like to live? Note what is listed next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">.4 </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">World Without Illness and Disease</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Third, it would be a world without </span><span class="font19">DISEASE, A WORLD IN WHICH ALL WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO GROW UP TN HEALTH AND LIVE OUT THEIR DAYS FREE OF PREVENTABLE AND CURABLE ILLNESSES.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">O how humankind yearns for freedom from illness and disease! But has medical science been able to stem the tide of disease and make substantial steps toward bringing about conditions in which all would enjoy good health? The stark fact is that there are more sick and suffering humans on earth today than ever before in history. Many millions of persons die each year from heart disease and cancer, often experiencing an agonizing death. Crippling arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other debilitating diseases make life miserable for additional untold millions. Real-Jy, then, is not an order without illness and disease only a wishful dream?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Viewing the matter from a purely human standpoint, the answer must be Yes. However, Jehovah God knows man’s desire for physical health, and he purposes to satisfy this desire for all those taking exquisite delight in him. When God's Son, Jesus Christ, was on earth he demonstrated what could be expected on a grand scale in the way of physical healing during his thousand-year reign. Jesus restored sight to the blind, opened the ears of the deaf, loosened the tongues of the dumb, enabled the lame to walk and even resurrected the dead to life.—Matt. 15:30, 31; Luke 7: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Without doubt you would like to live in an order in which the world of mankind would enjoy such a restoration to physical health. Do not consider the prospect too good to be true, for it is the purpose of the same All-Powerful Creator who designed the earth and its many marvelous creations. He is able to accomplish what he promises.—Rev. 21:3-5; Isa. 46:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfying Work and Justice for All</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But even with the blessings of peace, plenty and health, life could prove to be boring and lacking satisfaction. Other requirements need to be met in order to have an ideal system of things. So consider the next essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fourth, it would be a world with </span><span class="font19">WORK FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO EARN A LIVELIHOOD TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Today much unhappiness and frustration exist because of unemployment. Humans require satisfying work to be truly happy. Jehovah God realizes this, and, therefore, he has always provided rewarding work for his people. The joy-yielding work of making disciples of people of all nations and of building up the Christian organization wil] be extended soon to include a literal building program. The prophetic promise is: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. . . . the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full. They will not toil for nothing.”—Isa. 65:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yet there are still other vital essentials that need fulfilling in order for everyone to be truly happy. For even if all the above blessings were enjoyed, would it be an altogether desirable system in which to live if personal freedoms were squelched by a totalitarian ruler? Note, therefore, the next essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fifth, it would be a world in which </span><span class="font19">EVERY MAN WOULD ENJOY FREEDOM UNDER LAW, WITH JUSTICE FOR ALL.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">No matter how earnestly they have tried, human rulers have failed to bring about freedom and justice for all. They have seldom shown equal consideration for all people. Injustice and oppression reign world wide. O how humankind longs for a righteous administration of affairs’ But what man cannot supply, God will. His appointed Ruler is the resurrected Jesus Christ, and of him Jehovah says: “My chosen one, whom my soul has approved! . . . Justice to the nations is what he will bring forth.” (Isa. 42:1; Matt. 12:18) Yes, under his administration, “the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.” In these words we can confidently trust.—Rom. 8:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Opportunities and Leisure</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Often today race, nationality or social position is a determining factor as to the rights and opportunities one enjoys. Prejudice and even persecution against unpopular groups are common. Although in many countries there are efforts to secure equal rights and opportunities for all and to break down prejudice, little real success has been achieved. Understandably, then, the following is an essential for a desirable system of things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Sixth, it would be a world in which </span><span class="font19">EVERY HUMAN BEING WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP HIS CAPACITIES AND TALENTS TO THE FULL, AND BE REWARDED FOR HIS ENDEAVORS, WITHOUT PREJUDICE.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Such an arrangement there will be under the rule of God’s chosen king, Jesus Christ. Christ will copy the example of his Father, who &quot;treats none with partiality nor accepts a bribe.” (Deut. 10:17; Rom. 2:11) Therefore, all will have opportunity to develop their talents to the full. God through Christ will answer the request made to Him concerning the king: &quot;May he plead the cause of your people with righteousness and of your afflicted ones with judicial decision. Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one.”—Ps. 72:2, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Man was created to be happy and enjoy life. And while satisfying work is necessary, so also is rest from one's daily work. Certainly, then, we can all agree that the following is also an important essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Seventh, it would be a world in </span><span class="font19">WHICH ALL MEN WOULD HAVE AMPLE LEISURE TO ENJOY THOSE THINGS THEY REGARD AS THE GOOD THINGS IN LIFE.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">God created man and, therefore, appreciates his need for an opportunity to desist from his regular work. Jehovah took this need into consideration and provided his people the Israelites a sabbath day each week in which special attention was to be given to spiritual matters. So we can be assured that under the rule of His kingdom God will satisfy the human desire for periods of time in which to desist from one’s work, relax and give special attention to spiritual matters.—Ex. 20:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">An Order Founded on Love and Integrity</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What other requirement, you might wonder, could there be for a desirable order? The eighth and last essential listed by the doctors involves qualities possessed by those who would inhabit that order. Consider how important these are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Eighth,</span><span class="font19"> rr </span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">would be a world in </span><span class="font19">WHICH THE HIGHEST PREMIUM WOULD BE PLACED UPON THOSE QUALITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH MAN FROM THE LOWER ORDERS OF LIFE, SUCH AS INTELLIGENCE AND CREATIVITY, HONOR AND INTEGRITY, LOVE AND LOYALTY, SELF-RESPECT AND UNSELFISHNESS. AND CONCERN FOR HIS FELLOW MEN.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Love. Integrity. Unselfishness. Concern for one’s fellowmen. Are not these the qualities that truly make life pleasurable? Would you not delight to live with a society of people who have genuine love and concern for one another? But how can such an order be established? Through the efforts of men? Have their attempts thus far given reasons for optimism? It is obvious that they have not. If we are going to enjoy these ideal conditions, it is clear that mankind needs an entire new system of things to administer his affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Man's mistake has been in failing to look to his Grand Creator for the creating of such a righteous new system. Yet, this very thing God has promised, in harmony with his purpose and for man's eternal blessing! (2 Pet. 3:13) So if we want life, yes, if we want to live in a righteous new order amid people who manifest love and integrity, then we must turn to Jehovah God, who is the only One who can bring it about. We must learn God’s will, and do it. For it is a fact: This “world [of unbelieving mankind] is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever,” to enjoy eternally the blessings to be showered upon them by their loving Creator.—1 John 2:17.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>ASSEMBLY TIME</span></h1>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!&quot; correspondent in Malawi i ~</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font21">HERE is excitement in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Three more days and the much-talked-about assembly is due to begin. Assembly delegates from various parts of Malawi are already arriving at the assembly site. While we are busily engaged in helping our fellow workers with the building of a mammoth grass roof to serve as a sunshade for the 6,000 delegates expected to attend the assembly, an elderly man with a most happy face walks up to me. &quot;I also want to help in this work,” he says. Nothing unusual about that, but, as I learned from him, this assembly delegate had spent the last month or so in walking some 500 miles to the assembly site. He had just arrived, and the first thing he did was to volunteer his services in the preassembly work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Many others who, like this old man, could not afford to use public means of transport are now arriving. Some of them have cycled 400 to 500 miles in order to get here. Their spontaneous and heartfelt expressions of joy and happiness at what they see upon arrival at this neat-looking, newly built convention village seem, for the time, to transcend everything else. Yes, assembly time in Malawi is a happy time that Jehovah's witnesses here do not want to miss, even if it means walking or cycling for hundreds of miles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">Here in Malawi we build our own meet-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">ing place, so why not join me in seeing the preparations for an assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Selecting Assembly Site</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Selecting a suitable assembly site is not always easy. We may find a spacious, beautiful place and feel that everything is just right. We have enough ground, the place is near to the main road and not far from the railway station—things that are important to consider at this stage. Suddenly, however, something comes to mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Water! The fact that there are only a few houses in the vicinity makes one wonder if it could be the water situation that is keeping people away from this beautiful area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Zikomo Bmribo”</span><span class="font21"> (“Excuse me, Sir,&quot; in Cinyanja, the local tongue), I say to a man coming out from his thatched-roof hut, “where is the nearest water hole or stream with some good drinking water?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“Pepani</span><span class="font21"> (“I am sorry”), but it is a long way from here. Can you see those blue gum (eucalyptus) trees over there in the distance? Just behind them there is a lovely stream.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If that happens, we can no longer consider the place for an assembly site because there is no water available within a reasonable distance. But for the assembly now drawing near we have at last found a suitable site. Yet, if you could see it two months ahead, you would no doubt say: &quot;But where is the assembly going to be?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It is all “bush,&quot; long grass head high, big stones, rocks and trees. This is where we are going to have our assembly, and it is going to involve a lot of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Preassembly Work Hegins</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Early in the morning we are at the site ready to start work. More than fifty of us are here with the same thought in mind: Our assembly is only eight weeks off. Looking out over the bushy and stony area, we are comforted to know that there will be hundreds of our Christian brothers coming to give us their voluntary help each weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Now to the work! Our first task is to build some sleeping houses. This very place will be our home for the next two months. So off we go to cut enough grass, bamboos and a few trees. That is all we need in the way of building materials. It is true that we use a few nails, but for the most part we use “luzi,” a natural &quot;homemade&quot; string, as a substitute for nails. This “luzi” is taken from the inner bark of the &quot;mombo” tree mostly and is very strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When the sun sets, our houses are not ready, but we have sufficient shelter for the night. Before we retire we enjoy some good food in an improvised dining room made earlier during the day. This dining room has a grass roof supported by some bamboos, a long table, also of bamboos, with the top made of grass tightly tied together. There are some bamboo seats on each side of the table. While enjoying our evening meal, we are entertained by a music festival provided by the birds in the trees, singing their evening songs and filling the air with their soft melodies, and the gentle breezes refresh one’s tired body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“The first thing we have to do is to cut 25,000 bundles of grass,&quot; the one in charge of the work tells us the following morning. “It will take us at least four weeks to do that. Some of you have been assigned to cut grass, others to tie it in bundles and others again to carry it out to the main road. From there it will be brought here by truck and stacked in various places, as a precaution against fire,&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">After having completed the grass cutting, which took us four weeks, we are taken to a place fifteen miles from the assembly site to start cutting bamboos. &quot;We will need approximately 6,000 bamboos for the construction of assembly departments, the platform, a cycle park, a sunshade for the assembly arena, and seats for 6,000 people,&quot; we are told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From early in the morning to sunset we cut bamboos. We are happy because already with our eyes of imagination we can see 6,000 seats in the assembly arena. Some of the women Witnesses are preparing a meal for us right there in the bamboo field. They had to carry water in big buckets on their heads for over a mile and at least two of them had babies on their backs. We certainly appreciate the meal they prepare, enjoying it under an open sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We cut and carry out about 1,000 bamboos a day, which means that in a week's time we have enough bamboos to meet our needs. Since some 600 trees are needed mainly for the construction of the sunshade, the meeting place and the sleeping houses, we also cut them and have them transported to the assembly site. Some smaller trees, about 600 of them, are also cut to be used with some 3,000 bamboos for building the seats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Plan of the Assembly Area</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">By now we are tired. The cutting of all the grass, bamboos and trees is hard work, not entirely free from dangers, with a few poisonous snakes having to be eliminated to make the area safer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When showing us a plan of the assembly area, the Witness in charge gives us some interesting facts about the work to be done. The meeting hall is to be 36,000 square feet, 120 feet by 300 feet. There is to be a distance of 15 feet between each of the supporting poles holding up the gigantic 36,000-square-foot sunshade, which is to be 12 feet high near the platform and 7 feet at the back of this open-air “stadium,” making it possible even for tall people to walk around freely without having to bend. Can you picture before your eyes such a mammoth grass roof? The platform, 30 feet by 20 feet, is to be built of very steady eucalyptus trees with neat-looking reed mats attached to a splitbamboo frame. It is to be 12 feet high and have a floor made of dirt and bricks with a cement top painted red. The entire back wall facing the audience will have a beautifully designed painting framed with dark-blue curtains. What an exciting sight for the assembly delegates, some having walked for days from faraway bush villages!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">But that is not all. Equipment to furnish electric light is to be brought in, not only for lighting the platform, but for lighting the whole assembly area. What a surprise! Electric lights in the bush! The assembly area will look like a small lit-up town. Needless to say, we are really excited when we think of all these things as more interesting details about the assembly are made known. “We are going to build bamboo seats with back supports for more than 6,000 people,” we are told. “Ti'ue, this is something new in our country, but with Jehovah’s blessing we know we can do it. We will also build a cycle park for hundreds of cycles. This park will have a sunshade made of bamboos and grass. Any assembly delegate turning in his bicycle to this park is to receive a numbered ticket from an attendant in a small reed-mat office specially built for that purpose. When a cycle owner again wants his bicycle, all he has to do is to turn in his ticket to the attendant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We are going to have two huge towers of bricks to mark the entrance to the assembly hall. A big banner with the assembly theme on it is to be stretched from the top of the two towers. All the various departments, thirteen of them, are to be built of bamboos and reed mats. Sleeping quarters covering an area of more than 70,000 square feet to provide accommodation, dormitory-style, for some 5,000 people are to be erected. Each house is to accommodate from 200 to 700 assembly delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Cool drinks and other refreshments are to be served from three refreshment stands, and there are to be two cooking areas. Not many assembly delegates will come in private cars, but a well-designed car parking lot is to be cleared up, leveled and marked off with whitewashed stones, sectioning off a space for each car. What a strange thing to see on a maize field! Finally, the little pathlike road leading off from the main road to the assembly area has to be widened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Organization of the Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">After having received all this information, with only three weeks to go, we realize that we have a lot to do, but we are determined to make the assembly a success; so early next morning we are out in well-organized groups. Clearing the area of grass, bushes, trees and stones and then leveling it is the first task. As soon as one area is cleared, the group measuring and marking the sizes of the various buildings comes on the scene. Everything is clearly marked off with bamboo sticks, and immediately after the measuring is done a construction group with all the building materials now on hand begins working. A few are assigned to dig the holes in the ground for the poles and the bamboos; others are cutting the trees and the bamboos to the right size; some are splitting the bamboos; a few are handling the grass and some are busy using the hammer. For thirteen days about fifty Witnesses are busily engaged in making bamboo seats, producing each day seating for almost 500 people. The excitement grows daily as more and more neat-looking rows of seats are produced, until, finally, the entire area of 36,000 square feet is covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Only some hundred yards from the main entrance to the meeting hall, where two bricklayers are busy building two huge towers twelve feet high, with a three-foot diameter, another group of Witnesses is making some stands for the cycle park. Not far from the assembly center, many small groups are erecting the sleeping houses. Half the total number of sleeping houses are a bit bigger in size. The women will sleep in these. The children sleep with the mothers and so they need more space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">During the assembly the women get up early and go for water to a river about a quarter of a mile away. Hundreds of them walk to the river with either a bucket or a big pot on their heads. They first go downstream to wash themselves, their children and maybe some clothes, and then they walk upstream where the water is clean to get their needed supply. Then, with the water container on their heads, they go back to prepare some food before the morning session starts at eight o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A hazard at assemblies like this is fire. With many cooking fires and with an abundance of dry grass around, fire is indeed a danger, particularly when strong winds blow. So, on top of a huge abandoned anthill, a fire tower has been built. Twenty-four hours a day. assembly delegates take turns on the tower, looking out for fire or thieves who might try to enter the assembly area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As we are walking back to the assembly center with the program soon to begin, a friend runs up to me all excited about the things he has seen. With thousands of others he has just arrived to attend the assembly. “I cannot believe my eyes, what a difference in such a short time!” he exclaims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Yes, he, like many others who saw the place before the work on it started, may have found it hard to believe his eyes, but it all came about by hard work of a group of dedicated people who had a burning desire to make assembly time in Malawi, not only a happy occasion, but one that would bring glory to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We seldom think, perhaps, about the great amount of traveling we do, even while we are at home; for the earth, our home, is in orbit, revolving rapidly around the sun. As it so orbits, the earth is about 93,000,000 miles away from the sun. This may seem like a great distance; but the earth travels that far around the sun in about 60 days! Revolving around the sun at an average of 18 1/2 miles a second, 66,600 miles an hour, or about 1,600,000 miles a day, the earth completes its orbit around the sun after traveling about 595,000,000 miles a year. A person a hundred years old would have traveled with the earth nearly 60,000,000,000 miles!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>“Proof That There Is Liberty’'</span></h2>
<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font21">HE above headline appeared in a newspaper in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on June 14, 1966. The proof given that there is liberty was that a number of Jehovah's witnesses had claimed and been granted exemption from performing military service because of religious convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The then minister of the army, and now president. Marshal Arthur da Costa e Silva, was talking with a group of university students concerning some individuals opposing military service for what were considered political reasons, but of Jehovah's witnesses he declared: “We have some exemptions from military service of the ‘sons of Jehovah.’ These men prefer to lose their political rights rather than abdicate their pacifist convictions, but they are really pacifists, because they suffer the sanctions, they lose their political rights, and I am tired from signing claims of the 'sons of Jehovah' that do not want to perform military service for they abhor war. </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">So these men exercise a right that</span><span class="font21"> is </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">always observed.” (Diario Popular</span><span class="font21"> of June 14, 1966) (Italics ours) The right referred to is set forth in Article 150 of the Constitution of the Republic of Brazil, recognizing religious liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Exempt Because of Religious Convictions</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Before Marshal Costa e Silva assumed power on March 15, 1967, Marshal Castelo Branco governed Brazil, and his administration had already recognized the right of Jehovah's witnesses to exemption from performing military service because of religious convictions, and even before that this exemption was given, but the procedure was not well clarified. After the revolution of March 1964, the revolutionary government decreed the cancellation of the political rights of a number of persons prominent in Brazilian politics to remove from power men that were considered corrupt or dangerous to national security, but this was not the case with Jehovah's witnesses, who are recognized as being peaceful, upright and in favor of order, being obedient to the laws and the constituted authorities. Some misinformed newsmen wrote sensational reports when they read the presidential decree canceling the political rights of Jehovah’s witnesses who were granted exemption from performing military service. Nevertheless, in high military circles the position of Jehovah’s witnesses was well understood and no animosity was shown toward them for requesting such exemption because of religious convictions. There were needed, however, better established instructions and procedures on the handling of the requests. The military authorities studied ways of doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">On his ascension to the presidency, Marshal Arthur da Costa e Silva well knew the position of Jehovah’s witnesses, for he had served as minister of the army in the previous government. Now the authorities showed a desire to formulate a procedure for the processing and solution of the cases of Brazilian citizens seeking exemption from military service because of their religious convictions. Thus the constitutional right to religious liberty would be strengthened and clarified. So, in Decree No. 56, on June 8, 1967, the present minister of the army, General Aurelio de Lyra Tavares, set out instructions to the Directory of Military Service for granting claims for exemption from performing military service because of religious convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In accord with this decree, the minister of the army, in harmony with the proposal of the Directory of Military Service and the opinion of the chief of staff of the army, decided to approve detailed and complete instructions for the processing and solution of these cases. These “Instructions&quot; were published in the government newspaper, the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Diario Oflcial,</span><span class="font21"> on June 14, 1967, pages 6381 and 6382. Thus all military authorities throughout the country were advised of such instructions and will now be better able to attend to the claims of persons requesting such exemption. The </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Didrio Oflcial</span><span class="font21"> also published the terms of the request of the claimant and models of the declarations that should accompany it, making it a matter of regular routine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">To facilitate the handling of these requests by Jehovah’s witnesses the Directory of Military Service sent an official communication to </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Sociedade Torre de</span><span class="font21"> Vigia </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">de Biblias e Tratados,</span><span class="font21"> the legal agency of Jehovah's witnesses in Brazil, asking that all &quot;Congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses&quot; in the country be informed of this and that they read the “Instructions&quot; published in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Diario Oflcial,</span><span class="font21"> and this was immediately done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Although simplifying the process by which a Brazilian citizen may be exempt from performing military service because of religious convictions, this would not be a right automatically granted without investigation. The &quot;Instructions&quot; of the minister of the army published in the </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Didrio Oflcial</span><span class="font21"> indicate the investigation to be made &quot;in order to verify the truthfulness of the religious condition of (the petitioner), as claimed in the process in which he requested the right to exemption from performing military service because of religious convictions.” The investigator would interview the superintendent of the congregation of the petitioner and then make his i^ecommendation as to whether the request should be granted or not. The head of the religious community would accept responsibility for the information given, seeing that it was truthful and exact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Since this is a personal matter of conscience, the military authorities expect that the petitioner have true religious motives in order to enjoy such constitutional rights, and that he understand that the concession implies the loss of political rights if the exemption be granted. This would mean that he would be unable to vote, hold elective office, or act as a functionary of the government. Jehovah’s witnesses recognize that each individual must make a personal decision in this and other matters of conscience, and the overseers of the congregations would limit themselves to transmitting the instructions published in the official government organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">A People Who Are Respected</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">After being observed for many years, Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil have gained the respect of the people and of the governmental authorities by their good record of conduct and obedience to the laws. This was strikingly noticeable in January of this year when more than 46,000 gathered in an international assembly in Sao Paulo. For five days Pacaembu Municipal Stadium was transformed into a gigantic Kingdom Mall of Jehovah’s Witnesses as Bible dramas and discourses showed the practical application of Christian principles in modern living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A number of years ago there was a move to have the legal agency of Jehovah's witnesses dissolved, one of the charges being that they were against military service and civic worship of the flag. But after eight years of investigation, the counselor general of the republic gave a favorable opinion for Jehovah’s witnesses, and this was supported by the president of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Brazilian authorities have consistently recognized the constitutional right to freedom of worship, and the text of the new Constitution, which became effective on March 15, 1967, confirms this freedom. In Article 150, paragraphs 5 and 6, it. states: &quot;The Constitution assures Brazilians and foreign residents in the country the inviolability of their rights concerning life, liberty, security and property, in the following terms: ... §5 - There is complete freedom of conscience and the exercise of religious worship is assured to believers, as long as it is not contrary to public order and good customs. §6 - No one will be deprived of his rights because of religious beliefs, or philosophical or political conviction, unless he requests exemption from legal obligations imposed on all, in which case the law will determine the loss of rights incompatible with the excuse of conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Jehovah's witnesses have shown their appreciation of the recognition of these rights, and will continue to be obedient to the laws of the land, to pay their taxes honestly, and to respect that for which the flag of the nation stands by being orderly and progressive. Throughout the country they conduct free adult reading and writing classes, and this contributes to the progress of the people. Above all, they teach the high moral values found in God's Word, the Bible, building up in men, women and children appreciation of eternal spiritual values that contribute to the well-being of all peoples.—</span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">By &quot;Awake!” correspondent in Brazil.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark19"></a>WILL SUCH LIBERTY EVER COME TO SPAIN?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">REEDOM-LOVING nations grant ministers of religion exemption from military service. However, in Spain such exemption has not been granted to non-Catholic ministers. The New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Post of</span><span class="font20"> July 6, 1967, reported: &quot;At least 67 Jehovah's witnesses face the possibility of life terms in Spanish prisons for refusing to do military service.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Under Spanish law these ministers are being imprisoned repeatedly on the same charge. The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font20"> noted: “The courts invariably sentence them to between six months and six years for the first offense, at the end of which they are obliged to present themselves again for military service. . . . when they again refuse to serve, military courts impose bigger sentences of up to seven years' imprisonment.&quot; And England's </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font20"> of July 4, 1967, reported: “Four of the men are now serving their third consecutive prison sentence. They have been in prison for periods totalling between eight and 14 years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One minister, Alberto Contijoch Berenguer, has been sentenced three times to terms of 3 years, then 4 years, and then 6 years and one day, a total of 13 years and one day. In May of this year he was indicted for the fourth time for the same offense and is a prisoner in the Spanish Sahara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Spain's authorities have had several opportunities to correct this deplorable situation, but they have not done so to date. For instance, the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font20"> noted: “Although Spain is officially a Catholic country, it has not so far implemented a declaration by the Second Vatican Council recommending ‘that laws make humane provisions for the case of those who, for reasons of conscience, refuse to bear arms.<sup>1</sup> ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Another opportunity presented itself when Spain passed a new law on religious liberty. The original draft would have exempted nonCatholic ministers from military service. But what happened? The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font20"> stated: &quot;Rightwing deputies reversed the law in the Cortes, expressly altering it to ensure that non Catholic ministers of religion, unlike Catholic priests in Spain, must be liable to military service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Spain's course of action shocks decent people everywhere. They ask: Will true liberty ever come to Spain?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>PATIENT ENDURANCE YIELDS RIGHTEOUS FRUITA(</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">; EHOVAH GOD has set the perfect example in exercising the qualities of patience and endurance. And as his doing so has resulted in some persons' repenting and taking up His service, so the exercise of these qualities by Christians often has been similarly blessed. The following is an experience illustrating this fact:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;It was in 1956 that my mother and I first began to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. I was nine years old and my brother was just two. At this time our circuit minister encouraged my mother to begin a regular family Bible study. At first my father made no objections, since he was working full time and was home only in the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;However, my mother soon began taking us to all the congregation meetings. This irritated my father, as he felt that this was ‘too much religion.’ About this time he began having problems, and thereafter could work only part time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;In 1958 my mother and I both symbolized our dedication to Jehovah God by water baptism. I was eleven years old at the time. This really upset my father, because he realized how seriously we took our religion. And while he never caused us bodily harm, his constant belittling of Jehovah and his people often made it almost impossible to study the Bible at home. So we went ‘underground,’ and never missed our Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;In 1960 both my mother and I took advantage of the provision to share in the full-time ministry for a limited period (vacation pioneering), and we found this to be a great source of encouragement. Also encouraging to us through these trying times, when father was giving us such a hard time, was the love and consideration shown by our Christian brothers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“In that year, 1960, we also derived upbuilding from attending the Peace-pursuing District Assembly. However, this irritated my father so much that he broke some of our furniture. He also threatened to burn down the new Kingdom Hall that the Witnesses had recently built. And causing him even greater distress, my little brother, who was then five years old, became a regular Kingdom proclaimed</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;During the last three years (1963 to 1966) my father's mental condition became increasingly worse. But because of his attitude, there was little that we could do to encourage him. We had about given up hope that he would ever change. In the meantime, I became a regular full time pioneer minister, In August of 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“By the fall of 1966 my father’s condition worsened. My mother said: ‘All we can do now is leave it in Jehovah’s hands and wait on him.' And that we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“During the first week in November 1966 father began listening to our new Kingdom songs, and his attitude began changing. These songs softened him and he began to cry. Then he started reading the Watch Tower Bible publications for the first time in ten years. He got rid of his guns, and then things really began happening—for the good!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“That first week in November we will never forget. One evening father announced that he was going to become part of our family unit and share in all family activities. He even had prayer offered at the table, which is something he had never done before in his life. That same night he asked for a Bible study, and we arranged for one to be held with him. To top it off. he wanted to attend all the congregation meetings! In January he was present at the Theocratic Ministry School to hear his son, who is now twelve years old, give his first fifth student talk. It was indeed a very special occasion for us all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“For the past two months father has been attending all the congregation meetings, commenting at our congregation book study, answering at the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font20"> study, and even sharing in the house-to-house field ministry! He recently attended his first circuit assembly and was thrilled by the program, and especially by the loving consideration shown him by our Christian brothers. As mother said: ‘We are so happy we do not know what to say except, &quot;Thank you, Jehovah, for helping us to patiently endure.&quot;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;While ten years may be a long time, because of our present joy it seems almost as though the troubles that we experienced never really happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By &quot;Awake!” correspondent in Canada</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">I</span><span class="font21">F YOU were asked to cite some specimen of extinct animal life, which creature would you name? You might think first of the huge dinosaurs or perhaps the hairy mammoth. But did you know that other famous names have been added to these?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Indeed, modern times have produced some unexpected vacancies in the list of animals and birds, and man has had much to do with these disappearances. In fact, it has been said that man is responsible for the disappearance, or near disappearance, of more than 450 animal species. Now, with such a lengthy list as that, which would you suspect to be the most famous extinct animal or bird?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Unhappy Fame</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">You would, perhaps, guess the dodo, for this curious creature has become the very symbol of extinction. Although Mr. Dodo always appeared in the most proper dress, attired in dark-gray plumage and whitish breast, he was a most improbable bird. A member of the pigeon family, he was larger than a turkey. His combination of heavy body, large hooked beak and short curly tail waddled about on stubby legs. And for wings—mere rudiments! Mr. Dodo was earth-bound!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The dodo's rise to unwanted fame followed its discovery on the island of Mauritius by the Dutch in 1598. Appearing doltish and clumsy in bearing, it fell victim to the sport and cooking pots of sailors who called at the island. When the island was colonized, introduced rats, dogs, cats and pigs escaped into the woods to destroy the eggs and the young of the dodo. Its forest homo was stripped for ebony. By 1681 this defenseless bird had disappeared, becoming one of the most celebrated examples of extinct creatures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">Among the names of vanished animals few are more intriguing than the quagga of South Africa. Tins zebra-like creature was chestnut brown with black-and-cream stripes on its head, neck and shoulders only. Thickset and stocky, it resembled a colorful pony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">From the time of their arrival, European colonists killed the quaggas to provide meat for their native servants, leather for their shoes, and hides to make sacks for storing grain. In 1800 these splendid animals existed in droves of countless thousands. Less than a century later, by 1878, relentless hunting had completely annihilated them in the wild. A few had been sent to Europe, one pair even learning to draw their delighted owner’s two-wheeled carriage about London’s Hyde Park on Sunday outings. But, on September 12, 1883, a lonely quagga in the Amsterdam Zoo relinquished the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">QUAGGA</span></p><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:98pt;height:72pt;">
<p><span class="font21">melancholy distinction of being the only quagga in the world. Its</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">beautiful race was thereby added to the '**' list of extinct creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The North American Scene</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Each continent has suffered the loss, in whole or in part, of animals and birds once plentiful. However, “of all the continents, North America has witnessed the most drastic changes in abundance of wildlife and the greatest number of extinctions in historic times,&quot; according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. And once again, humans take the blame!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Massive Extermination</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The classic example is that of the passenger pigeon. This bird once comprised an estimated 35 percent of the entire bird population of North America. Here, indeed, was a most unlikely candidate for extermination. It is difficult to imagine the spectacle it presented along migration routes of 150 years ago.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-10.jpg" alt="" style="width:105pt;height:154pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">In the distance one could hear the roaring like a gale at sea. On the horizon appeared a dense cloud of dark furor, advancing at speeds approaching sixty miles per hour, until the air was filled with the din of millions of beating wings. The sun disappeared behind the wheeling, darting mass of feathers. For hours the uproar continued! Alexander Wilson, a leading ornithologist of 1810, described one flock that stretched for 240 miles and was one mile wide. He estimated that it contained over two thousand million birds. ten times the entire bird population of Great Britain!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">When such flocks settled to roost or nest, hundreds of birds filled every tree until large branches gave way under the weight. Nuts, seeds and fruits were consumed in tens of thousands of tons daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Many square miles of lush forest were devastated by a single nesting. While such invasions could hardly be allowed to continue unchecked without ruinous damage to valuable crops, man mishandled the situation so badly that the unthinkable resulted—the passenger pigeon disappeared!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The habit of congregating in dense flocks made the passenger pigeon vulnerable to mass slaughter. Hunters, amateur and professional, greedy for sport or profit, performed a full-scale massacre. Men and boys equipped with guns, nets, clubs, poles, axes and even small cannons, waded into the roosting grounds and reduced the pigeons by millions annually. Records from the 1870’s tell of eleven million birds’ being shipped to food markets from one point near the Canadian-American border in one three-year period alone, and more than fifteen million from another point in only two years. Hundreds of thousands of mangled pigeons were left to rot otto be consumed by scavengers. &quot;Sportsmen” captured others alive for later use, such as the 1881 Coney Island pigeon shoot that blew 20,000 birds out of the sky as they were released from their cages. Not even the multitudinous passenger pigeon could withstand such an onslaught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">One of the last nestings in considerable numbers was reported from the Canadian prairie province of Manitoba in 1887. Thereafter the flocks dwindled and disappeared until, finally, a solitary blue hen blinked with forlorn gaze from her perch in the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens. Her name was Martha. A reward of $1,000 was offered to find her a mate. No one collected. On September 1, 1914, Martha died a spinster at the age of twenty-nine years. The passenger pigeon was added to the list of the extinct!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Persecuted Wildlife</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The great auk, a penguin-like, flightless bird, once decorated the barren ocean rocks of northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland. However, it was long slaughtered indiscriminately for its flesh, feathers and oil. In early June, 1844, a pair waddled across a ledge into the path of three waiting hunters, and the last two great auks known to man joined their forebears in oblivion. Another addition to ' the extinction list.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-11.jpg" alt="" style="width:53pt;height:97pt;">
<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT AUK</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">The heath hen, a form of prairie chicken, was industriously pursued for early American cuisine. Once plentiful, it too was reduced to a point of no return. It was last seen on March 11, 1932. All of these extinct birds were once considered too plentiful ever to vanish. This misconception of inexhaustible wildlife also resulted in a change of scenery in the Canadian and American West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Rison to Bones</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It is early fall on the western Canadian plains. Below our vantage point an unbelievable panorama unfolds on the vast windswept prairie of southern Saskatchewan. As far as the eye discerns, the entire plain is a sea of bison in the most breathtaking seasonal migration among land animals! Shading our eyes from the dazzling sun, we blink a moment; the vision vanishes, and in its place are fields of golden grain, where a million bison once roamed the grasslands. In retrospect, the moment of history required for man to deplete the “buffalo&quot; appears just as fleeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">An estimated sixty million bison once trampled the Great Plains from Canada to Texas. This humped, thick-shouldered beast provided the Plains Indians with virtually everything needed for their existence. Indian hunts took a heavy toll, but it was the coming of the railroad and professional hunters that really staggered the bison. An unprecedented slaughter ensued. One hunter recorded a kill of 4,280 bison in just twelve months. His name was William Cody, the famed Buffalo Bill.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-12.jpg" alt="" style="width:97pt;height:85pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">Railroads, in Canada and the United States, transported hides and tongues, the latter considered a delicacy, to eastern markets, leaving millions of carcasses to decompose on the plains. When the herds were gone, bleached bones were shipped east to be ground for fertilizer. The appalling sight of glistening bones scattered everywhere so impressed the settlers that these bleak remains were incorporated in the naming of settlements. Regina, provincial capita] of Saskatchewan, had the inglorious title of “Pile-O-Bones&quot; until the 1880's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Public sympathy toward the bison finally spurred attempts to save it from being added to the growing list of extinct animals. Although now gone from the wild state, the animals are faring well in parks and zoos, where they continue to delight visitors. But as one returns the blank stare of this shaggy, sullen beast, one cannot help imagining a note of nostalgia for bygone days, the days before Mr. Bison almost became a stuffed curiosity in the museum of extinct animals and birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The Next to Go?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Among other creatures said to be perched precariously on the verge of annihilation are the grizzly bear, the American bald eagle and the marmot-like prairie dog. Even the pouch-billed pelican is reported to be losing ground, not slowly, but very quickly. The sentimental favorite in this struggle for survival is a majestic bird that could well be the next to vanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The whooping crane is the most statuesque of North American birds. Standing over five feet tall, with a wing span of seven feet, it is satin white with black wing tips. This noble bird migrates annually between Texas and breeding grounds 2,500 miles north. Agricultural drainage drove the crane farther north to find suitable terrain beyond human haunts. Following a nesting in Saskatchewan in 1922, location of its nursery remained a mystery of the wilderness for over thirty years until a Canadian helicopter pilot made a supply trip to a bush fire in Wood Buffalo National Park. This ideal sanctuary spans the iake-and-muskeg border between Alberta and Canada's Northwest Territories. In spite of conservation sanctuaries and legal protection, naturalists remain concerned that agricultural chemicals or a few careless hunters could destroy the fewer than fifty survivors and relegate this splendid creature to the lengthening list of extinct ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Earth's largest living creature may soon be added to the sorrowful list. The blue whale is known to attain a length of a hundred feet, and its organs alone are huge, the heart weighing almost half a ton and the liver almost a ton. How thrilling it would be to see this massive creature gliding effortlessly through the waters of the southern hemisphere! But alas! this may soon be impossible. It is estimated that over 300,000 of these huge, graceful creatures have been slain during the past hundred years, 30,000 being the known catch for a single year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Says </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The World Book Science Annual, 1966,</span><span class="font21"> on this subject: “Sad to say, these icy waters [of the Antarctic] may also be its graveyard, for it has been driven headlong toward extinction—a victim of the harpoon and the desire for profit. ... no one has been able to give the blue whale complete sanctuary. And now the struggle for survival may be hopeless.” One authority estimates that fewer than 600 of the great creatures remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“The demise of the dinosaurs,” writes international conservationist Noel Simon, “remains veiled in mystery and surmise, but there is no need to speculate on the disappearance of the blue whale; the rapaciousness of man is wholly responsible.” Selfish man has been aptly described as &quot;the most dangerous predator,&quot; and his treatment of God’s animal creation described by expressions such as “unrestricted slaughter&quot; and “continued plunder.” According to a recent issue of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian,</span><span class="font21"> almost 1,000 species of wildlife are now on the danger list. How much longer will the list of the extinct creatures become?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Selfish challengers of God’s beneficent rule of all his creatures take delight, as did Nimrod of old, in defacing man’s earthly home by senseless slaughter of living creatures. (Gen. 10:8, 9) The Supreme Sovereign of all the universe will not permit this condition to continue indefinitely. In fact, he has declared his purpose shortly to &quot;bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” (Rev. 11:17, 18) Thus the wanton slaughterers of wildlife themselves will become extinct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24">W</span><span class="font21">ATER is an interesting and unique part of our earth. Its abundance and availability mark the earth as different from the other planets in our solar system. We all know from personal experience how important water’ is. Without it we could not have a morning cup of tea or coffee, nor make ice for our cold drink during</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font21">the hot summer months.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">Without it we would</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">have neither steam heat nor water-cooled engines in our automobiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Probably the most extensive use for water is for irrigation purposes in farming. In the United States alone it is estimated that between 75 and 100 thousand million gallons </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">a day </span><span class="font21">are used in this way. This use accounts for about half the fresh water that is used annually in the United States. The next-largest customer for water is, not the home, but the factory. Steam power plants and other industries use an estimated 70 thousand million gallons of fresh water daily. How is so much water used? It takes IS barrels of water to refine one barrel of oil, 300 gallons of water to make a barrel of beer and 10 gallons of water to refine a gallon of gasoline. A large paper mill uses more water each day than does a city of 50,000 people. But what is it about water that makes it so useful? What makes water work the way it does?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Water is one of the most interesting of all the chemical compounds, being a mixture of two gases that combine to form, not another gas, but a liquid. This, in turn, can be solidified and used as ice or heated into steam, acquiring even more interesting properties. The formula for water was proved when the two gases hydrogen and oxygen were exploded by an electrical current. The result was water, and an amazing property of water was thus discovered. When two of the most volatile gases known are exploded together, the result is, not a fire, but water, the substance used to put fires out!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">There is a definite chemical relationship between the two gases when combining to form water. From the viewpoint of their relative weights, it takes one part by weight of hydrogen to combine with exactly eight parts by weight of oxygen. Oxygen is a much heavier element than hydrogen, so, from the viewpoint of the volumes of - the gases instead of their</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">weights, it takes two volumes of hydrogen to combine with one volume of oxygen to get, not three, but two volumes of water vapor. This is because the 2H combine with O to form a molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O. And how large is this molecule? It takes about a trillion trillion of them to make an ounce of water</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The Universal Solvent</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">One of the most important properties of water is its power to dissolve a great variety of different compounds. There is no liquid on earth that can surpass water for its practical solvent qualities. With good reason it has been called the “universal solvent.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Especially is waler a vital solvent for living things. Since all the different substances that comprise protoplasm (the essential substance of both the cell body and (he cell nucleus) are either soluble in water or can be suspended in it, water is an essential means of transporting nutrients to the cells and of carrying away the waste products. Every organic process occurs in a watery medium; for example, respiration and digestion. Blood really is composed of about 90 percent water. A large volume of blood is necessary at all times to carry oxygen to the tissues and to carry away waste products. Adequate water must be maintained in the body tissues as well. For example, adult muscle is from 80 to 90 percent water. All tissues contain water in their protoplasm. In terms of total body weight, water makes up over two-thirds of the human body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What happens when one does not get enough water? The water content in the tissues lowers and the blood becomes more concentrated. This means that the blood cannot circulate as freely, and its oxygencarrying capacity is reduced. The tissues do not receive the oxygen they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Waste products begin to accumulate in the tissues. If water is not obtained soon enough, the functions of the body eventually stop and death results. It is thought that one cannot live if he loses about 20 percent of the water in his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Water and Good Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">If we are to stay alive, we must have water, and that almost daily. It has been observed that some animals can live as long as three months and sometimes more without food, but they will die in five to ten days when they cannot get water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">How much water is necessary for good health? That depends on physical condition, weight, age and other factors. Under ordinary conditions the adult human body loses about fifty fluid ounces of water a day. Of this about twenty ounces is lost through the skin as perspiration, another thirteen ounces in the air exhaled through the lungs, and the balance, about seventeen ounces, in the urine. Naturally this varies with each individual. For good health this lost water must be replaced daily. Not all need be taken as fluids; some is obtained in the food we eat. Fruits and vegetables contain from 80 percent to 90 percent water, and milk about 87 percent. In the normal diet we can expect to take in from one and a half to two pints of water a day, including the water that is present in food and that which is formed by the body in the oxidation of food. How does the body make water by oxidation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It has been observed that when one molecule of glucose is oxidized in digestion, six molecules of water are produced. Where did the water come from? From inside the glucose molecule, which has many hydrogen and oxygen atoms in its structure. When that molecule is broken up by the influence of gastric juices and enzymes, other products are produced, and the leftover hydrogen and oxygen atoms are combined by the body to form water. How truly wonderful is the chemical makeup of the body! We surely must agree with the psalmist who wrote: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—Ps. 139:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In this manner, the body can manufacture some water for itself; indeed, some animals, such as certain deseildwelling rodents, can make so much water that they never need to take a drink! In humans it has been estimated that a person producing 2,400 calories of heat per day can obtain about ten fluid ounces of water as a result of this oxidation of food. Such water is sometimes called “metabolic water.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">How Plants Use Water</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Plant life is greatly affected by the abundance or lack of available water. In the study of trees we can learn much about how water is utilized in other plants. About 75 percent of the weight of a tree either is water or is made from water. All the food for the tree, the nitrates and the minerals, is absorbed from the ground. To be carried into the tree the nitrates and minerals must be soluble in water. There may be present in the earth certain chemical elements, but if they are bound in compounds that are not water soluble they cannot be carried into the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Carbon dioxide is another product that the tree must have in order to grow. It enters the tree through the leaves, but cannot be used until it is dissolved in the water inside the tree. Once inside the tree the elements can be used in the vital processes of life because the water transports them to different parts of the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Another important role that the water plays in the tree is in maintaining &quot;turgor,” which is the normal tension on the cell wall necessary lor the support of the cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Plant cells utilize water in yet another way. This is in what is called &quot;bound water.” This differs from free water in that it is combined either physically or chemically as a part of the molecule in the plant. This “bound water” is very difficult to separate from the molecule since it actually is a part of the molecule itself. At low temperatures this water does not freeze and cannot be rendered useless by winter weather. At high temperatures it is not lost through evaporation. Naturally this has many advantages to the plant. Bound water is of special interest in connection with the ability of plants to resist low temperatures and drought. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and produces its crop the following summer. A severe winter will kill many varieties of winter wheat, but a hardy variety of winter wheat may contain three or four times as much bound water as a nonhardy variety. Drought-resistant grasses may contain ten limes as much bound water as nondrought-resistant varieties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Chemical and Physical Properties</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Water has other useful properties that make it work in many ways for our benefit. For instance, water has almost the greatest heat-absorbing capacity of known substances (bromine and hydrogen being two exceptions). How is this property useful?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For one thing, water, in the form of oceans and lakes, acts as a cushion against the rising and the falling of temperatures and therefore makes a more comfortable climate in the areas where there are large bodies of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In the regulation of body heat, water has an important role to play. This is because it possesses what is termed “high specific heat.” This enables the body to store heat effectively without greatly raising the temperature. It also has “high heat conductivity.” This property permits heat to be transferred readily from the interior of the body to the surface. Finally, water possesses &quot;high latent heat of evaporation,&quot; which causes a great deal of heat to be used in the evaporation of water and thus cools the surface of the body when we perspire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">We have already mentioned the transportation of water in plants, but one way in which this is accomplished is interesting. Water has a strong attraction for itself; it “sticks to itself,” which we call cohesion. It also sticks to other things, and we call that adhesion. This latter property of water is very important. Because water can stick to other substances it can actually “climb&quot; up in a small tube. This is known as capillary action and is the main means of transportation in plants. The water enters the plant from the ground and must climb up the tree, carrying with it the dissolved substances that the plant, needs for life. Actually, this process depends upon both the cohesion in the liquid itself and the adhesion to the walls of the small veins inside the plant. How powerful is this force? It is known that in some trees a water column of 430 feet in height can be supported by this powerful “sticking” force of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Water inside living things enters into many of life’s chemical processes. Many compounds can be split by water to form others and thus carry on the chemical work of the organism. Cane sugar, for example, is split into equal parts of glucose and fruit sugar, one water molecule being used up in the process. Of even greater importance to life is the splitting by water of some of the phosphate compounds. This process releases energy, which then can be used by the body for the building up of other vital compounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">In plants, too, water plays a chemical role in the photosynthesis process. Sunlight on the green plant causes oxygen to be released from the water and causes the hydrogen atoms left over to be utilized, along with carbon dioxide, in such a way as to form sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Ice and Steam</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">A discussion of water’s properties would not be complete without a word about its many applications and its usefulness in the solid state as ice and also as water vapor —steam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Water is unusual in that it reaches its most dense point </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">before, it becomes a solid. </span><span class="font21">How is this important to us? If water gradually became more dense with the lowering of the temperature, as do most substances, it would solidify in such a way as to be a real problem for mankind. Actually, water reaches its most dense point at 4 degrees </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">above</span><span class="font21"> its freezing point or at 4 degrees Centigrade. This means that when a large body of water, such as a lake, cools from the cold air above it, the surface water becomes cold first and grows heavier. It sinks to the bottom of the lake, and the warmer water rises. In this way the entire body of water cools at the same rate. Finally, the surface water falls below 4 degrees Centigrade and the water turns to ice, which is lighter than the dense water below it and so does not sink, but, instead, floats on the surface. Therefore, instead of having the bottom freeze first, and thereby eventually filling up the lake with ice and killing all water life, a thin crust of ice forms on the surface and prevents the rest of the water in the lake from becoming cold enough to freeze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">One of the principal uses of water in industry is to generate power through steam, water in the vaporous form. Water has the ability, when changing from ice to liquid to steam, to “store up&quot; heat and hold it without itself rising in temperature. Hai'd to believe? Then read an explanation given in the book </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">“Steam, Its Generation and Use,”</span><span class="font21"> by the Babcock and Wilcox Company:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“If we take a quantity of ice, say one pound, at absolute zero and supply heat, the first effect is to raise its temperature until it reaches a point 492 degrees above the starting point. Here it </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">stops growing warmer,</span><span class="font21"> though we keep on adding heat. It, however, changes from ice to water and when we have added sufficient heat to have made it, had it remained ice, 238 degrees hotter or a temperature of 315 degrees by the Fahrenheit thermometer, it has all become water, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">at the same temperature at which it commenced to change, </span><span class="font21">namely, 492 above absolute zero, or 32 degrees by Fahrenheit’s scale. Let us still continue to add heat and it will now grow warmer again though at a slower rate, that is, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">it now takes about double the quantity of heat</span><span class="font21"> to raise the pound one degree that it did before—until it reaches a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit —here we find another critical point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“However much more heat we may apply, the water, as water . . . cannot be heated any hotter but changes on the addition of heat to steam and it is not until we have added </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">heat enough to have raised the temperature of the water to 1,178 degrees . . </span><span class="font21">. that it has all become steam, which steam </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">nevertheless is at the temperature of 212 degrees.</span><span class="font21"> Thus over four-fifths of the heat which has been added to the water has disappeared, or become insensible in the steam to any of our instruments . . . the heat which has been absorbed by one pound of water to convert it into a pound of steam at atmospheric pressure is sufficient to have melted 3 pounds of steel or 13 pounds of gold. This has been transformed into something besides heat; stored up to reappear as heat when the process is reversed. That condition is what we are pleased to call latent heat, and in it resides mainly the ability of the steam to do work.&quot; (Underlining ours)</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What an amazing substance water is! Every day of our lives we see water working for us, in the plants we must have for food, in our own body chemistry to keep us healthy and in the practical uses we find for it to help us do our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Systems have been devised that allow space explorers to orbit the earth in outer space, but scientists know’ that, unless they can solve the problem of providing sufficient water, the human race is bound to this earth by its need for abundant water in order to maintain life. The fact that we have this water on our planet earth— a unique feature of the earth in the solar system—shows us in what a wonderful way the Creator, Jehovah God, has provided for the life that He created here. Understanding some of the interesting ways in which water works for us helps us to appreciate the boundless wisdom that God possesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Antarctic Was Warm</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Taking note of drastic changes that have occurred in the earth’s crust and climate, The World Book Science Annual for 1965, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Science Year,</span><span class="font20"> said: &quot;The discovery of coal and fossil ferns in the Transantarctic Mountains . . . was evidence of a warm climate in the past. Obviously, there had been a reversal of climate.’’ Great climatic changes took place after the Noachian flood.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Let’s Have a “Mezza” Together</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!&quot; correspondent in Lebanon</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">B</span><span class="font20">HAT is my invitation to you if you ever come to Beirut. What is a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza f</span><span class="font20"> It is a Lebanese speciality Ln food that you will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We can go to an open-air cafe by the seaside. With a starry sky overhead and the moon shining on the beautiful Mediterranean Sea, waiters bring huge trays with forty or more small, diamond-shaped dishes. Their shape allows them to fit snugly on the table with no space wasted. Since the waiters do not rush us, we can take our time, as much as two hours or more if we wish. Now permit me to describe some of the interesting foods. They are all Arab specialities and delicacies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We have a salad called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">tabooli</span><span class="font20"> that is made of parsley, fresh mint, onions and tomatoes that are all chopped fine and mixed with cracked wheat. To this has been added lemon juice, olive oil and spices. You will enjoy it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There is also something that resembles eggs hut which is much larger and brown in color. This is a Lebanese speciality called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">kibbee. </span><span class="font20">It is made of ground lamb mixed with cracked wheat molded into hollow egg shapes. Into the hollow center of each are stuffed meat, pine nuts and onions. These are fried until they are a golden brown. There is also another dish of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">kibbee</span><span class="font20"> that is served uncooked. The lamh and cracked wheat are kneaded together and served raw, with some olive oil on top, and onions and fresh mint to garnish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Two dishes resemble each other, both looking like mashed potatoes with olive oil on top; but they are different. One, called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">baba-ghanouj,</span><span class="font20"> is made from grilled eggplant that has been mashed with sesame oil, garlic, lemon juice and spices. The other dish, called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">homos,</span><span class="font20"> is made from boiled chick-peas and is also mashed with the same ingredients as </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">baba-sjhanouj.</span><span class="font20"> Each has a distinctive taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font20"> you like seafood, the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza</span><span class="font20"> will not disappoint you There are some shrimps, oysters, a bit of lobster, small fried fishes and a few snails. There is also an assortment of cold meats, such as tongue, liver, spleen and brains. In addition to the salad already mentioned, there are other salads, mixed with sauces and spices, to go with the various dishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Something that may raise an immediate question from you is a dish with cigar-shaped things lying on it. These are cooked grape leaves with a mixture of rice, tomatoes, meat and spices rolled up inside of them. You will find them delightful. There are also lots of nuts. When you sit down to this interesting table of many small diamond-shaped dishes. I will say, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Tfadd'.iUoo!”</span><span class="font20"> which means “Help yourself!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Do not look for knives, forks and spoons, because we are enjoying this </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza</span><span class="font20"> in Lebanese fashion. We use bread in place of utensils. On the table are baskets of round, flat bread. Pieces of bread that we tear off the loaves serve as our forks and spoons. With a bite-size piece in one hand scoop up a morsel of food directly from one of the dishes. This is sanitary because, each time you scoop up some food with the bread, you eat the bread and all. The next time you scoop in a dish, it is with a fresh piece of bread. You can reach most of the dishes without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza</span><span class="font20"> is not complete for many persons without a glass of Lebanon's national drink. It is called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">ar ack,</span><span class="font20"> made from white grapes and flavored with aniseed. When water is added to a glass of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">arack</span><span class="font20"> to dilute it for drinking, it turns a milky white. With some icc added, it is usually drunk slowly along with the meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">An exchange of conversation is an important part of a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza,</span><span class="font20"> because it is not just a meal. It is a form of entertainment. That is why it may last for two hours or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When you leave the table after the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza, </span><span class="font20">your stomach will feel full and satisfied. But more than that, you will have tasted dishes such as you may never have tasted before. Indeed, a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">mezza</span><span class="font20"> is an unforgettable experience!</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font22"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Price Variance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">A recent survey report issued by the American Medical Association shows that the price of a specific drug can vary between drugstores as much as 1.200 percent. The price range for every drug studied varied by more than 100 percent</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><img src="g_E_19670822_files/g_E_19670822-14.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:119pt;">
<p><span class="font24">T</span><span class="font21">HE apostle Paul, in giving instructions on congregational meetings of Christians, stated, among other things: “I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man.” (1 Tim. 2:12) Today many religious organizations take exception to these words of Paul. In fact, we find more and more women being ordained to Protestant pulpits. Just why did the apostle state this rule?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">This rule is based on a principle that governs the relations between the sexes, namely: “The head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.” (1 Cor. 11:3) The logic of headship must be apparent to all. If two or more intelligent persons are to cooperate, there must be organization, and for organization to be successful there must be a head. That Jehovah God, the Father, is the Head of his Son. Jesus Christ, is obvious; also, that his Son should be the head of his congregation. But not so readily appreciated is the statement that man exercises headship over the woman and that therefore woman should not exercise authority over the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">However, the facts show that the headship of man is both somatically and psychologically sound and in the best interests of all concerned, even as we shall see. Thus a leading authority on the human body </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">(soma), Gray's Anatomy</span><span class="font21"> (1966 Edition), tells the interesting fact that as regards the human skull there is no difference between the male and the female until the time of puberty; but then as adulthood is reached the difference becomes more and more apparent. The female skull is lighter and its cranial capacity is about 10 percent smaller than that of the male, even as is the rest of the anatomy. The contour of the female skull is also more rounded and the facial bones are smoother. Apparently, with the lines of beauty goes less rugged strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">True, mere brain size in itself is not as important as brain quality, but where the quality is the same tile larger brain size has an advantage, Thus </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Science News, </span><span class="font21">April 1, 1967, told of twenty African children who were so extremely undernourished in the first few years of their lives that “head circumferences . . . averaged an inch less than the others, indicating smaller brain.&quot; And over the years all these were found to have verbal, mathematical and perceptual capabilities far below those of other children. Implicit in these findings is that man is advantaged by a greater brain size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">That it is in the best interests of both sexes for man to take the lead is also supported by psychological evidence. One of New York city’s leading psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, Dr. Marie N. Robinson, in one of her books, which deals with certain frustrations of married women, skillfully demonstrates by case histories that many of these particular frustrations can be ended if women will but recognize the fact that the way their bodies are made gives evidence that it is intended for man to be the head. As she expresses it, women must learn the art of &quot;eternal acquiescence” and &quot;deep altruism” in dealing with their husbands if they want to find happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The children also stand to benefit when the Scriptural principles governing the sexes are followed. To woman falls the lot, not only of conceiving and bearing children, but also, to a great extent, of nurturing them in their earliest infancy and on to maturity. It stands to reason that for a mother to do justice to her task she must, have an abundance of love and devotion, she must have much patience, great gentleness and mildness and be extremely sensitive to the needs of her offspring from infancy onward, if they are to thrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">It follows that her entire personality must be of such a sensitive and gentle nature as to do justice to the delicate needs of the tiny developing minds and bodies. However, an abundance of such qualities does not go hand in hand with those needed for leadership and meeting stem challenges. More than that, by the Scriptures' limiting the woman’s role in the congregation it makes it more likely that she will have the needed time and energy to look after the needs of her family properly. So, while she may have other interests, she should never forget that as a wife her career is caring for the physical, mental and emotional well-being of her family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Scriptural position might be said also to take into consideration woman's biological nature. As every woman in the prime of life is well aware, she has certain difficult days each month during which she cannot give of her best and during which she very much appreciates her husband’s showing her consideration. But if she had responsibilities of oversight and was required to hold forth regularly on the public platform regardless, either her performance or her health would suffer. Recognizing this factor, God’s Word counsels husbands to dwell with their wives “according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one.’’—1 Pet. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Of course, the foregoing does not mean that mothers are not to teach their own children. The Bible speaks of “the law of your mother” and tells of the good results of mothers’ teaching their offspring the Word of God, as in the case of the Christian minister Timothy. (Prov. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:5; 3:14, 15) Nor does it mean that women may not be schoolteachers, instructing youths and adults in secular subjects. But women are not to exercise authority over Christian men in the Christian congregation nor are they to assume authority over their own husbands in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">That women are not precluded from preaching to those outside the Christian congregation can be seen from the prophecy quoted by the apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost: “I shall pour out some of my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams; and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.” (Acts 2:17, 18) In keeping with this prophecy, today there are literally hundreds of thousands of women ministers who “prophesy” by preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and who teach Bible truths to both men and women in their homes and who receive many blessings from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The headship that the Scriptures assign to the man indicates that man and woman have different roles to play in life. The fact that Christian husbands are commanded to love their wives as Jesus Christ loved the congregation, he even dying for it, should certainly preclude any criticism of the role that God’s Word assigns to the man. His is a difficult assignment, but for it he has also been equipped. Truly the Scriptural position is seen to be sound, practical and wise. Happy are all those governed by it!—Eph. 5:25-33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">The Age of Rebellion</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;t&gt; The criticalness of our day has never been more obvious than in the last few weeks— chaos in the streets of Newark, Plainfield and other cities in America; strikes and the threats of strikes in the railroad, rubber, copper and auto industries; civil war in Nigeria, violence in Hong Kong, riots in Korea, tribal war in the Congo, raids on the Sudanese, war in the Middle East and southeast Asia. Hunger, disease and ignorance are said to be &quot;not inevitable,” but they exist and become Intolerable for many, leading to violence. Wars are generally abhorred among the common man, but governments continually become involved in them and seek ways to wage these wars more vigorously. These events are in keeping with the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. World conditions witness to its truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Rise of Lawlessness</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; Disrespect for law and order was prophesied for our day, and New Yorkers can testify to the truthfulness of the Bible account. Iron bars on house doors, protective gates on storefronts and heavily screened windows have become standard equipment in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. &quot;Look up and down this avenue and you’ll see more gates than you will see in any prison in the U.S.A.,” remarked an old-time merchant. “Years ago, back say to 1945, this was a class avenue.” This is where once movie actors used to buy their suits. There were 82 synagogues in the neighborhood. Now there are only two or three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A detective told a caller: &quot;Don't come out this way by subway. You could be mugged getting off the train in broad daylight.” In this neighborhood even the police are mugged in daylight. In an area of 67,000 residents about fifty trips on emergency calls are made each day by police. On the days when welfare recipients go out to cash their checks, thieves snatch about fifty pocketbooks. One police precinct reported 1,883 arrests in 1956. In 1966 there were 3,901 arrests. That is almost eleven arrests every day of the year, on an average, for one precinct!</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Homosexuals “Married”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">-4i&gt; Two male homosexuals were secretly &quot;married” by a Roman Catholic priest in Rotterdam. The &quot;couple” had asked for a mass to be said to confirm their relationship. During the mass, held in private and attended by the families of both men, the “couple” exchanged rings. The Catholic priest explained, on July 5. that homosexuals “are among the faithful to be helped.&quot; The priest. H. M. J. Stoelinga, said that he was moved by his conscience to perform the marriage ceremony. The Roman Catholic Church was thus put in the position of blessing the homosexual relationship. What could be more disgusting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Britain the House of Commons voted, on July 4. to approve a bill to reform British law on homosexual conduct. The proposal for reform was originally made in 1957 by a committee headed by Sir John Wolfenden. It was rejected twice, but In recent years opinion has shifted. The Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church and the Methodists all supported the Wolfenden proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In America, on July 4, a score of placard-carrying pickets in front of Independence Hall In Philadelphia contended that homosexuals are denied rights. One sign read: &quot;Fifteen million U.S. homosexuals ask for redress of grievances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Children on the Rampage</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the Bronx Zoo, New York, there is a sign above a window that says. 'See the most vicious animal alive.’ People rush to the window to have a look. The window Is equipped with a mirror. Usually there is a burst of laughter. The experience, however, is both revealing and condemning. If zoo keepers in Seattle, Washington, were reminded of this sign early in June, they had their reasons. More than 15.000 children and adults charged through the new children's zoo on June 9, leaving behind tormented animals and a mutilated landscape. A number of turtles and pigeons were stolen. A woman dug up a rhododendron plant. Fantail pigeons had their feathers plucked and broken. Baby turtles were dropped from heights, splitting their shells. A peacock had its elegant tail feathers plucked. Tormented for hours, the bird turned and pecked a four-year-old child on the face. Youngsters picked up stones from a stream and heaved them at the ducks. One zoo employee complained: &quot;I don’t get it. We give them something free and they destroy it.” It was a day that had again proved the axiom that animals are sometimes better behaved than people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Church in Decay</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; The Church of Canada is rife with ‘bigotry', prejudice and idolatry,’ stated Kenneth McMillan, minister and general secretary of the Canadian Bible Society. He said that the average churchman in Canada has no idea what the church is about. “Many people cling fanatically to some institution, to some building—identifying their faith with some particular window or some organ or pew; or something that happened long, long ago,&quot; he said. Church adults, he commented, &quot;are tempted to retreat into a narrow nationalism, into de-r.ominationalism, into confes-sionalism into fundamentalism, or something else.” He also said that in Canada ministers in droves are wondering what the ministry is all about. &quot;So many are really broken men, trying to carry on. not having lost faith but desperately concerned and frustrated. They're just worried sick about it.” “They are confronted with the sheer triviality of church life, with its heartbreaking pettiness,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">War Cost to Rise</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">*&gt; The cost of the Vietnam war to Americans will no doubt rise in men and money as a result of renewed evaluations from the battle zone. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara made his ninth trip to Vietnam early in July. The results of the previous trips were not always reassuring. In 1963 he predicted that most of the American forces would be out of Vietnam by the end of 1965. Now U.S. strength is scheduled to reach nearly 500,-000 by the end of 1967. General W. C. Westmoreland, in his regular evaluations of the situation, is understood to have suggested </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font20"> possible American force of 750,000 men. People in Washington foresee a possible 55,000,000,000 increase in military spending as a result of the new military build up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">A Not-So-Quiet Revolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; Quebec, Canada, with its population of 6,000,000 French-speaking persons and overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, is undergoing a not-so-quiet revolution. Quebec is rapidly becoming a secular state. It is moving away from Roman Catholic authoritarianism. Among the clergy and youth traditional conservatism has given way to unrest. The Montreal archdiocese, with a population of 1,348.000 Roman Catholics, has fewer than 1,000 regular clergy to staff its 267 parishes. 70 hospitals and hundreds of schools. In the past the church was the main voice in articulating the aspirations of French Canadians. Today many voices are being heard. People feel free to accept secular values without seeking the approval of the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Marriage Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; In Honduras a marriage is not considered valid unless it is performed before the civil authority. In the spring of this year Monsignor Hector Enrique Santos, archbishop of Honduras, requested the government to authorize the priests to perform civil marriages prior to the religious ceremonies. But the clergy were reminded that Honduras is a state separate from the church. The Civil Code of Honduras says that civil matrimony may be celebrated only by mayors or the chief of the district and by no other authority. Though religious weddings have been performed without the required civil matrimony, they are not recognized as valid before the authority of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Freakish Weather</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;*» A</span><span class="font20"> massive cold front swept over Buenos Aires from Antarctica, dropping temperatures to 22 degrees above zero. Nearly all the flowers perished in the cold wave. At least six deaths were reported. The con sumption of natural gas leaped by 50 percent and prices on heaters rose 25 to 50 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A typhoon roared in from the Pacific on July 9, and before the day was through, 347 persons died or were missing in the southern areas of Japan. The storm, called Billie, hit the western half of Kyushu. Torrential rains fell, setting off landslides. The floodwaters swirled through Hiroshima and its surroundings, smashing houses into rubble and driftwood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Employment Discrimination</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Citizens aged 65 and over now are nearly 10 percent of America's population. Officially the unemployment rate for the elderly is below the overall rate. But. such figures mis lead. One reason is that the elderly simply stop looking for jobs, knowing there are no jobs for them. They are often referred to as &quot;retired,’’ which is a polite word for unemployed. Nine out of ten large U.S. corporations have mandatoryretirementpolicies One-half of the job openings in the United States are closed to anybody aged 55 or over, and one in four job openings is closed to workers as young as 45. The U.S. Labor Department classifies a worker aged 45 or older as an “older worker” and this age-group makes up nearly one-half of the long-term unemployed ir the United States. The cost to the United States econom;. of the situations, in unemployment compensation and lost production, is estimated at more than $4,000,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Higher Taxes on Alcohol</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&gt;&gt; Cirrhosis of the liver is reportedly the 10th-most-fre-quent cause of death in America, accounting for more than 20,000 deaths a year. A recent study showed that deaths from the disease were rising constantly. Dr. Milton Terris, president-elect of the American Public Health Association, called for higher taxes on alcohol to price it out of the reach of the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Dishonesty over the Centuries&quot; </span><span class="font20">• Hans Kung, dean of the Catholic theological faculty at the University of Tubingen, West Germany, offered his opinions on the role of the Catholic church to an audience at Stanford University. How can the church fight for theological truth? he asked. Answering, he said: By &quot;preaching the gospel without compromise”; &quot;by courageously ridding ourselves of feudal titles, gestures and customs that the world has long since found to be dishonest; by ridding ourselves of pomp and luxury in liturgy and life, in dress and ornament&quot;; by providing &quot;more freedom in the church in all areas, especially in theology by getting rid of the imprimatur in theological literature.&quot; &quot;How much does it take,” he asked, &quot;before a Catholic theologian openly admits that any particular fallible pronouncement, like an encyclical, or a papal address, or a decree of the Holy Office, was a mistake? One tries to find a way out by means of clever distinctions. When the error is admitted it is often too late for the world,” Kung said. &quot;The church could win back through truthfulness some of the credibility she has lost in the eyes of the world through dishonesty over the centuries.&quot; he declared.</span></p>

I've just checked your X rays” ... “You what? I’m calling my wife.” For an hour all the wrong numbers were being tied into the trank line. The 100-A machine, about tile size of a small tape recorder, had a malfunction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">Whether by telephone or jungle drums, we need to communicate with others who are beyond the sound of our voice. Generally such communications take the form of person-to-person discussions with specific individuals, though occasions do present themselves when we would like to communicate our message or point of view to the public at large. In ancient times rulers used official couriers and heralds to publicize their proclamations. But when the time came that private persons were free to publicize their own ideas, tracts and pamphlets, copied by hand, became popular. Now the printing press has made this means of publication one of the chief means of mass communication. And leading the field of periodicals that communicate factual information at regular intervals are </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font21"> and </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>

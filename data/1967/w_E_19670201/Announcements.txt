FIELD MINISTRY
There are many things in life that may bring a person a measure of joy, but there is one source of joy that stands out above all others in the lives of Jehovah’s witnesses. What is that? Sharing in Jehovah’s service. Not that the preaching work is always easy, but there is abiding satisfaction in knowing that one is doing the will of God and is aiding his fellowmen to lay hold of eternal life. It is this joy that Jehovah’s witnesses will have during February as they call at the homes of people to discuss the Bible and to offer, as an aid to interested persons, a year’s subscription for The Watchtower for just $1.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There are many things in life that may bring a person a measure of joy, but there is one source of joy that stands out above all others in the lives of Jehovah’s witnesses. What is that? Sharing in Jehovah’s service. Not that the preaching work is always easy, but there is abiding satisfaction in knowing that one is doing the will of God and is aiding his fellowmen to lay hold of eternal life. It is this joy that Jehovah’s witnesses will have during February as they call at the homes of people to discuss the Bible and to offer, as an aid to interested persons, a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>for just $1.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal in 1967 is Saturday, March 25, after 6 p.m. Standard Time. Each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses should start now to make arrangements so that all who are regularly associated with the congregation and other interested persons can gather together for this occasion. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers, if available and capable, should be assigned to deliver the discourse. In harmony with Jesus’ instructions to his disciples while he was still on earth, we urge all readers of <em>The Watchtower </em>to be present for this meeting.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>.</p>

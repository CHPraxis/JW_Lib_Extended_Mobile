<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus Christ said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) These words are as applicable today as when they were first spoken. Jehovah’s Christian witnesses know this and so they realize that, to be spiritually nourished, it is important not to neglect the house of the true God. Regularly each week their meetings build them up spiritually and equip them to witness to others about God. During July, as they apply this training, they will be sharing with others one of the fine Bible-study aids that they use in their own congregation meetings. They will offer to all persons the book <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God, </em>with a booklet, for only 50c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The ability to win friends and influence people is the desire and ambition of many sincere persons. Is it yours? Do you take into consideration with it how your efforts along these lines please God? Our relationship with others should concern us, but so should the principles that God has laid down in his Word, the Bible, to govern these relations. What Bible principles are involved in a happy marriage? How do they affect our choice of employment, our attitude toward political activities in the community and conflicts between nations? Read the hardbound book of 416 pages, <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </em>Sent at once, for only 50c.

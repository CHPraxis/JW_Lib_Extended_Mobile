<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The theme that the apostle Paul develops right from the beginning of his letter to the Galatians is that God through Jesus Christ has delivered his people from this present wicked system of things. The apostle stresses the fact that Christians have been made free for the new system of things, and now they are to stand fast for that freedom, zealously guarding their liberty-giving worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:3-48:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:1-48:5:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>) One of the main ways Jehovah’s witnesses guard their liberty-giving worship is by sharing it with others. But for others to experience this grand deliverance and to attain to liberty-giving worship they need the Word of God, the Bible. To meet this need, Jehovah’s witnesses, during the month of December, are offering to all persons a copy of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>along with a booklet for $1.</p>

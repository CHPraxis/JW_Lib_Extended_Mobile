FIELD MINISTRY
Before his ascension to heaven, the Lord Jesus instructed his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people . . . teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) It is in obedience to that command that Jehovah’s witnesses call at your door. Yes, they are teachers of the things that are recorded in the Bible, and they offer their personal services free of charge. As a further aid to interested persons, during April they will be offering a year’s subscription for this fine Bible-study aid, The Watchtower, with three booklets, for just $1. Avail yourself of the opportunity to obtain it.
HOW STRONG IS YOUR FAITH?
In the crucial days ahead the faith of all Christians will be tried to the limit. How strong is your faith? If it is to be an unwavering faith you must be fed the pure Word of God regularly. No magazine is so dedicated to this lofty purpose as is The Watchtower. This is proved each year as thousands of its newer readers dedicate their lives to God, relying in faith on God’s promise to direct their steps in security. You can share this joy this coming year by subscribing now. One year, one dollar. Order now and obtain three free booklets on Bible topics.

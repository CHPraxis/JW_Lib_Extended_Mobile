Effects of Rebellion
It is often claimed that through the efforts of science the life-span of humans will be lengthened greatly. But the Bible states that because of Adam’s rebellion, mankind has been degenerating and actually has a shorter life-span today than he did several thousand years ago. Will science eliminate the effects of Adam’s rebellion? The New York Times of October 30, 1966, in the article “Medicine: The Mystery of Why We Grow Old,” stated: “At the moment, efforts to lengthen the life span seem to have broken down. . . . it is now generally agreed that no single factor is involved in aging. . . . the conquest of cancer, heart disease and the like will not lead to a dramatic increase in the life span. Too many weaknesses are built into the human frame to be overcome.” Only in God’s new order will this be reversed so that man can grow back to the perfection of mind and body that Adam enjoyed before his rebellion.

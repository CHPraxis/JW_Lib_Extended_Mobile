<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● From 1946 to 1948 an American soldier and a German civilian worked together at an American base in West Germany and became good friends. After several transfers, both met again in 1951 and worked together until 1952. It was during this period of time that the wives of both started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, much to the unconcern of the soldier and the opposition of the German.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1952 the two parted ways and lost contact with each other for the next fifteen years. Then they met again in February of this year at South Lansing, New York. Both of them were there to attend the two-week Kingdom Ministry School, a refresher course for overseers and ministerial assistants of Jehovah’s witnesses. What a joy to meet after all these years! Especially to be united in the worship of the only true God, Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When the two sat together at the school and examined their lives, it was interesting to note that the wife of one was able to overcome the lack of interest, while the wife of the other overcame opposition. It was also interesting to note that both of them had begun to study the Bible in 1953; both were baptized in 1956, within two months of each other; both received their first appointment as ministerial servants in the congregation in 1958. And now, in 1967, both attended the 90th class of the Kingdom Ministry School!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Both of these ministers are thankful to Jehovah God for blessing them with a new start in life, and hope that they can be used still further to give honor to His name.</p>

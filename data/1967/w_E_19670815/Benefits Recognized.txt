● At a circuit assembly in California the following experience was related: “At my place of employment a group of workers had evidently discussed Jehovah’s witnesses, one of them expressing the belief that the Witnesses are right and that they had an enlightening book with the word ‘Babylon’ in the title. A co-worker of mine told him she felt I would be able to get the book for him. The next morning she told me about the discussion; and I was able to tell the man that I could get him the book, adding that I did have with me a copy of the book ‘All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.’ He said: ‘I will take it.’ I told him that I would bring the book ‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules! tomorrow. He said, ‘OK! Bring me ten!’
“Arrangements were made to deliver them during the lunch hour, at which time I asked, ‘What are you going to do with all these books?’ He said, ‘I am going to mail some of them and pass some of them out to my friends. If a little bit of this truth rubs off on whoever reads it, it will do a mighty lot of good.’ Later, through a telephone call he asked me for two more ‘Babylon’ books, two ‘All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial’ and two copies of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. He subscribed for both The Watchtower and Awake! and placed an order for more Bible-study aids. Though he has been transferred, I learned that one of the Witnesses who works nearby has made arrangements for further helping this interested man.”

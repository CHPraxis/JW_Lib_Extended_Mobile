FIELD MINISTRY
Before his ascension to heaven, the Lord Jesus instructed his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people . . . teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) It is in obedience to that command that Jehovah’s witnesses call at your door. Yes, they are teachers of the things that are recorded in the Bible, and they offer their personal services free of charge. As a further aid to interested persons, during April they will be offering a year’s subscription for this fine Bible-study aid, The Watchtower, with three booklets for just $1. Avail yourself of the opportunity to obtain it.
MAKE THE BIBLE AN OPEN BOOK TO YOU
The Bible is universally acknowledged as the best seller of all times; over two billion copies being distributed in 1,200 languages. Yet it is still a closed book to many. Do you find it so? Many are discouraged from Bible reading by archaic, outdated language and stiff, obscure translation. Now the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures brings you a new modern version in our everyday speech, opening up the Bible to you. To add to your pleasure and understanding, read also the valuable Bible-study aid Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. Both, only $1.50. Send today.

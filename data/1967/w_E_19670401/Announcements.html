<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before his ascension to heaven, the Lord Jesus instructed his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people . . . teaching them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) It is in obedience to that command that Jehovah’s witnesses call at your door. Yes, they are teachers of the things that are recorded in the Bible, and they offer their personal services free of charge.

Now the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>brings you a new modern version in our everyday speech, opening up the Bible to you. To add to your pleasure and understanding, read also the valuable Bible-study aid <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </em>Both, only $1.50. Send today.</p>

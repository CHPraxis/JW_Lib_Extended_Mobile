<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their ministry in an organized way, under the direction of their Fine Shepherd and Jehovah’s Principal Servant, Jesus Christ. In harmony with Jesus’ own instructions, those in the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses who take the lead are not an exalted clergy class, but the servants of their Christian brothers. Together, as a united group, they cooperate in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. During January they will be doing this from house to house by offering to interested persons this Bible magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>which, as its front cover shows, is devoted to “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” A year’s subscription, along with three Bible booklets, will be offered for $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>HOW DO YOU VIEW THE BIBLE?</strong></p>

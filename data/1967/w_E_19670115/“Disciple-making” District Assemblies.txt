“Disciple-making” District Assemblies
Memories of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies held during 1966 have not yet faded. In fact, in South America and the Caribbean those assemblies are still in progress. Those who attended any of these assemblies were deeply moved by the things that they saw and heard and they are looking forward to the next assemblies arranged by the Watch Tower Society. So the question is already being raised: Where will we have our assemblies during 1967?
Arrangements for these assemblies have been under way for some time now, and we are glad to pass on to you the details now available concerning the dates and cities. The assemblies will be spread throughout the entire period of the northern summer, and they are conveniently located so that every reader of The Watchtower should find it possible to attend. We encourage you to make plans now to be sure that your vacation dates include one of the 1967 “Disciple-making” District Assemblies.
Each assembly will open on Thursday afternoon and conclude on Sunday evening at about 6 p.m. Will you be present all four days? We encourage you to do so. Those who came to the assemblies only for the weekend last year were disappointed to find that they had missed some of the choicest portions of the program. We feel confident that, with Jehovah’s blessing, the program this year, right from the first day, will be just as delightful and spiritually upbuilding as was the one in 1966.
Unless otherwise indicated, the programs for the assemblies listed below will be in English, but, as you will note, some of the assemblies in the United States will provide a program in Spanish.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In order for people to put faith in Jehovah God and his provision for salvation through Christ they need to hear the Bible’s message and have opportunity to get their questions answered. During March, if one of Jehovah’s witnesses calls at your home, it will be with the desire to help you personally to get satisfying Bible answers to your questions. He will gladly take time to show you the answers in your own Bible. As a further aid, he will encourage you to subscribe for this fine Bible journal, <em>The Watchtower, </em>for a year, for $1.</p>

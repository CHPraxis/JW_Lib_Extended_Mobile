‘Happy Those Having Part in the First Resurrection’
Many readers of The Watchtower were well acquainted with William R. Brown and Thomas E. Banks, both of whom died late in January. William R. Brown, long known in West Africa as “Bible Brown,” was approaching the age of 90. Of his fifty-seven years as a full-time minister, twenty-seven were spent in West Africa, where he saw Jehovah’s witnesses grow in numbers from one to more than ten thousand ministers. He finished his earthly course in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on January 25, 1967. Thomas E. Banks represented the Society for many years in the southern States and the Caribbean islands. Later he served as branch servant in Jamaica. There he completed his earthly ministry, which began with his dedication in 1901, on January 29, 1967. Doubtless these devoted servants, by their faithful course unto death, may now enjoy the happiness of the first resurrection, triumphing over death.​—Rev. 20:6.

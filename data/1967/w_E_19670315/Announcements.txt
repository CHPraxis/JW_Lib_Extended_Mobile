FIELD MINISTRY
In order for people to put faith in Jehovah God and his provision for salvation through Christ they need to hear the Bible’s message and have opportunity to get their questions answered. During March, if one of Jehovah’s witnesses calls at your home, it will be with the desire to help you personally to get satisfying Bible answers to your questions. He will gladly take time to show you the answers in your own Bible. As a further aid, he will encourage you to subscribe for this fine Bible journal, The Watchtower, for a year, for $1.
TO OPEN NEW FIELDS OF UNDERSTANDING
How much do you know about the Bible as a book? its origin? its writers? the evidences of its inspiration? Regardless of your past study, the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” will open new fields of understanding and appreciation of the Book of Books. This intensive, heartwarming view of the Bible is not an interpretative study, but it will acquaint you with the background and contents of every one of the Bible’s sixty-six books.

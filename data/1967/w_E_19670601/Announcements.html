<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Life is a gift from God. Recognizing this, Jehovah’s witnesses endeavor to use their lives in harmony with the will of God. They appreciate that they are in debt to God; so they apply themselves to pay what they owe to God. They devote themselves to his service and to aiding others to learn of God’s loving provision for everlasting life in a righteous new system of things. To that end, they urge everyone to read the Bible. During the month of June they will be calling at the homes of as many persons as possible to offer them a fine, modern-English Bible, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>for just $1.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Life is a gift from God. Recognizing this, Jehovah’s witnesses endeavor to use their lives in harmony with the will of God. They appreciate that they are in debt to God; so they apply themselves to pay what they owe to God. They devote themselves to his service and to aiding others to learn of God’s loving provision for everlasting life in a righteous new system of things. To that end, they urge everyone to read the Bible. During the month of June they will be calling at the homes of as many persons as possible to offer them a fine, modern-English Bible, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, for just $1.
SECURITY AND A HAPPY LIFE
Few things are as diligently sought after as happiness. Even most persons who make money their goal in life believe that it will bring them security and a happy life. But the basis of all happiness is the exercise of godly principles. That is because these never fail; they are eternal. And the one who can live by them has found a treasure that no one can take away. Make these lasting principles a part of your daily life by reading the Bible daily. Obtain the excellent modern-English version New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures and read it with understanding and lasting benefit. This complete Bible is only $1.

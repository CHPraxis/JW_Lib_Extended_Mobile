FIELD MINISTRY
Zealous activity marked the life of Jesus’ disciples. They joyfully accepted the responsibility of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. That is the way it is with Jesus’ modern-day disciples, Jehovah’s witnesses. They are joyfully busy in preaching, but keep this work in balance with other Christian responsibilities. (1 Pet. 1:13, 1950 Ed.) During May part of their work will consist of calling on people from door to door to talk about God’s kingdom and to offer them the excellent Bible-study books Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God and “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” either one for 50c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HE WAS only a nine-year-old lad, but he had gotten the spirit of the good news of God’s kingdom. This was apparent from the letter he wrote the branch office of the Watch Tower Society at Athens: “My parents told me that if I succeed in the annual school examinations by obtaining a perfect mark, they would give me as a present 500 drachmas [about $17.00 in value]. In fact, I succeeded in the examinations, and my parents gave me this promised gift money, telling me to use it at my own discretion. After having reflected, I came to the decision to use this money for expanding the publication of the good news, and I remit it to you through our overseer.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Remarkable? Yes, but not altogether unique, for that the good news of God’s kingdom has this effect on children is also seen from what a five-year-old Rhodesian child wrote the Watch Tower Society’s branch office at Salisbury: “Dear Brothers, Here is my donation to the Society for 1/​- [one shilling; value, 14 cents] that my Daddy gave me for sweets. Instead of buying sweets my mind decided to send it to the Society because it will help a lot more than to buy sweets.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yes, remarkable it is that young children should manifest such an unselfish spirit, but perhaps even more remarkable is the mature way these two young children expressed themselves: “After having reflected, I came to the decision,” wrote the nine-year-old; and “my mind decided to send it to the Society,” is the way the five-year-old put it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Both of these youngsters appear first to have given the matter some thought, then resolved in their little hearts to give expression to an unselfish impulse and then acted upon that resolve. In doing so they were acting in keeping with the apostle <span id="page313" class="pageNum" data-no="313" data-before-text="313"></span>Paul’s inspired advice: “He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:6-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By this advice the apostle Paul manifests a wisdom and understanding of human nature that came to him by means of God’s holy spirit. We may have resolved, decided or purposed in our hearts, after due reflection, to contribute so much of our weekly wages or salary to the Christian cause, but then when it comes actually to parting with the money, it may not be so easy. Obviously, it is far easier to resolve in one’s heart than actually to give, but this is where a test of one’s appreciation comes in, as well as a test of integrity, of keeping one’s self-respect with God. At the time we resolved we were keenly aware of the merits of the Christian cause, but, when the time comes actually to give, we may all of a sudden become keenly concerned with our own needs, which then may seem more pressing. The principle here is similar to that governing the making of vows.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This principle can be applied to ever so many situations in life. For example, a husband may be sick abed and, appreciating how much care and affection his wife is showering upon him, resolve in his heart to buy her a large bouquet of roses or to take her out to a fine dinner just as soon as he has recovered. But then when he gets well, he may forget about it or dismiss it from his mind as a rather extravagant or sentimental notion. While he was sick he was very appreciative of all his wife was doing, and what he resolved to do upon his getting well was a sensible as well as fine and noble thing. Now he should follow through, just as he had resolved in his heart while sick abed!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>IN REGARD TO ONE’S WORSHIP</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This principle finds many applications in the life of a Christian. For example, at the congregational meeting he may have it brought home to him how important it is to get to meetings on time; that it shows respect for God’s Word and His arrangement, and so forth. Hence he resolves to come on time from now on. But then when the time rolls around for the next meeting, it is not quite so simple to follow through, to discipline oneself to get an earlier start, but that is what he obligated himself to do and should do in view of his having resolved this in his heart.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Or a Christian minister may be listening intently to the counsel and admonition given at his congregational service meeting in regard to the field ministry and resolve in his heart to devote three hours the following Sunday morning to preaching the good news of God’s kingdom from house to house and in making return visits. But then the weather may be a little inclement, or he may find few ‘hearing ears,’ or he may note that others have stopped preaching after an hour or two, and so, instead of doing as he had resolved in his heart, he contents himself with less.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Thus also in regard to finding time for Bible study. A Christian is encouraged to make regular provision for personal Bible study and so may resolve in his heart to set aside Monday evenings for it. But when Monday evening comes, unless he acts with firm resolve, he may find himself sidetracked by an appealing television program, some popular magazine, or by some chore that could have waited; and, as a result, he fails to do as he had resolved in his heart.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>IN MONEY MATTERS</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The apostle Paul enunciated this principle in connection with making contributions <span id="page314" class="pageNum" data-no="314" data-before-text="314"></span>to needy Christians, but, of course, it also applies to all other avenues of Christian giving. One should, first of all, give the matter mature consideration, serious thought. Every Christian is a steward, accountable to Jehovah God for how he uses all his assets, such as time, energy and money. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:2-46:4:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:2</a>) He should ask himself: Just how much do I need to fulfill my obligations toward my family or to provide properly for myself? After the barest essentials are taken care of, how much more must I have in the way of better food, clothing and shelter? Here is where godly contentment comes into the picture. As Paul also wrote: “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” The more modest our wants, the more ‘ambitious’ can be our giving. But the more ambitious our wants, the more modest, most likely, will be our giving.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:7-54:6:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">And there are so many opportunities to give in a material way. To begin with, there is the local Kingdom Hall. It may have been built recently, and before it was, slips were probably passed out to all in attendance to learn how much all were willing and able to give; and upon this information plans were made and acted upon and a new Kingdom Hall built. But, then, as the months go by it happens at times that some fail to give as they had resolved in their hearts and had even put down on paper. Are they heeding the counsel for each one to “do just as he has resolved in his heart”?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In addition to opportunities to contribute to the upkeep of the local Kingdom Hall, there is the opportunity to contribute to the publishing and directive agency of Jehovah’s people, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. During the 1966 service year this Society, in keeping with its chartered purpose to spread the truth of God’s Word and kingdom far and wide, spent more than $4 million just in caring for the expenses of such full-time ministers as district and circuit servants, missionaries and special pioneers. Where did all this money come from? From exacting dues? From passing collection plates? From fund drives? No, but from the voluntary offerings of Christians who were impelled to imitate the unselfish examples given in God’s Word and who, after mature consideration, then gave just as they had resolved in their hearts. Among such the Scriptural examples of that kind of giving are the gathering of supplies for the making of the tabernacle in the wilderness and its furnishings, and the collecting of materials for the building of Solomon’s temple, which giving caused such great rejoicing on the part of both King David and his people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:4-2:36:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 36:4-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:1-13:29:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 29:1-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There are at times also other opportunities for giving in a material way. It may be that a disaster has struck, furnishing an opportunity to help fellow Christians, as happened comparatively recently in the southern part of the United States. Then, again, those blessed with an abundance of this world’s goods often feel impelled to give something in a material way to those who deny themselves much for the sake of being able to keep on serving Jehovah full time as pioneers. In this respect they may be said to be like Mary, who anointed Jesus’ hair and feet with costly oil out of sheer appreciation for his unselfish ministry. When she heard Jesus’ words of commendation, how happy she must have been to have done in accord with her heart’s resolve, extravagant though it may have seemed when actually carrying it out!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:6-40:26:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Today there is also the provision of “Conditional Donations.” Some who have considerable sums for which they have no immediate need can make a conditional <span id="page315" class="pageNum" data-no="315" data-before-text="315"></span>donation of it to the Society, with the understanding that in times of unforeseen need they could draw upon it as needed. This gives them a sense of financial security and at the same time permits their money to be used to further the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. Of course, at death such funds would become outright donations to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, simplifying matters. Those interested can write the Watch Tower Society’s office in their own country about this.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">And just one more thing. In connection with all this giving as one has resolved in his heart, let us not overlook the further words of Paul. Let all such giving be done “not grudgingly or under compulsion,” as though it were an unpleasant duty, an onerous burden. Rather, let it be with joy, out of love, out of gratitude to Jehovah God for the ability to give, remembering that “God loves a cheerful giver,” and that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

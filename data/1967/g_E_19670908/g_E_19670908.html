<p><span class="font20">B</span><span class="font15">EFORE you finish reading this sentence, at least ten babies will have been born throughout the world. And, at the end of your day, the world's population will have increased by nearly 200,000 persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For many, the birth of a child is a welcomed event, bringing into the world a life to love and cherish. For others, bringing forth an additional life complicates an already difficult situation. And on a global scale, today’s fast-increasing population frightens those who study it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In this regard one authority said recently: “In 1950 many students of the . . . situation concluded that a major world catastrophe was in the making. Today when we view the growth of world population in relation to what mankind is doing about the situation, that catastrophe appears a near-certainty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Similar' opinions are voiced by the overwhelming majority of those concerned with population trends. New Zealand’s </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Southland Daily News</span><span class="font15"> reported: “Unless something is done to arrest the present growth of population, the human race is in for a black and dismal future. . . . Even if the distribution of food is perfected ... it could not possibly keep up with such a rate.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A New' York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> report of January 20, 1966, stated: “Four Nobel laureates urged today that government take an active role in curbing population expansion. One of them raised the possibility that uncontrolled population growth might force man to resort to cannibalism, and another feared that the world would be plunged into a new' Dark Age.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Still another commentator called the population growth &quot;the gravest problem of our time, certainly more serious in the long perspective than war or peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Summarizing the opinions of analysts, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &lt;£ World Report</span><span class="font15"> declared: “How can the w'orld feed all its people, at the rate the population is growing? That is becoming the world’s No. 1 problem. A look at what’s happening shows why experts are worried. The human race is doubling in numbers every 35 years.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Skyrocketing Growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">From the evidence gathered by those concerned with the situation, it is clear that the growth in world population in our day is very different from the slow increase of many centuries ago. What is taking place today has been termed a &quot;population explosion.” Some are calling it a &quot;population time bomb.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Never before in history</span><span class="font15"> have so many people been added to the human family each year. At present there is an annual increase of about 70,000,000 births over deaths. That is much larger than the total population of France!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A look at the long-term population trend reveals just how staggering the increase is. It took from the first century to the seventeenth century before the population of the world doubled from 250 million to 500 million. Then, in a little over two hundred more years, in the nineteenth century, the population doubled again, reaching about one thousand million (1,000,000,000). But in only a hundred more years, in the twentieth century, it once more doubled. And now? At today’s rate of growth the population would double in just thirty-five years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Another way to understand better the magnitude of this explosion is to realize that it took all human history up to the year 1830 for the world's population to reach 1,000,000,000. However, the second thousand million was added by 1930, in only a hundred years. The third thousand million was added by 1960, in just thirty years. And currently the world grows by one thousand million people in only fifteen years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In the years ahead, each thousand million will be added ever faster. Population experts agree that, if the present rate of increase were to continue, there would be at least 6,000,000,000 people on earth by the year 2000. Then it would take only eight years for the next thousand million persons to be added. If that rate were maintained, two hundred years from now there would be almost 200,000,000,000 people on the face of the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Another factor to be considered is that the growth </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">rate</span><span class="font15"> has not remained steady. Commenting on the current 2-percent annual growth of world population on the average, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font15"> stated: &quot;In itself, that seems small, but it is more than double the rate of fifteen years ago, and the cumulative effect is staggering.” So, not only has the total number added to the population increased each year, but the percentage of growth has likewise increased, combining to make a highly explosive mixture for future growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Why the Explosion Now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What is responsible for this sudden explosion of the w’orld's population? The basic reason is that advances in disease control have drastically lowered the death rate in most countries, while the fertility rate has not decreased. Indeed, because of better care during pregnancy, the birthrate has increased in most lands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">An example of this is the country of Ceylon. In 1946 life expectancy at birth in that land was forty-three years. But in just one year that life expectancy increased to fifty-two years, a gain of nine years' This was due primarily to the introduction of insecticides that practically eliminated malaria, Ceylon's major disease that was responsible for its high death rate previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In other countries similar advances have been made in the last half century, although perhaps not as quickly as that made by Ceylon. Nor have the countries that reduced their death rates been among only the highly developed, richer nations of the world. In less developed lands governments have adopted disease prevention methods established elsewhere and have been able to reduce or even eradicate many diseases that hitherto had taken a high toll of lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The mass control of infectious disease has produced a spectacular reduction in the death rate among infants and children. It is one of the main reasons why persons under twenty-five years of age make up more than half the population of most countries. This high percentage of young persons feeds the population increase. Children that previously were cut down in death due to disease now live to marry and produce children of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Compounding the Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What compounds the problem is that the population is exploding the most in the very lands that can least afford it. The increase is particularly centered in countries near or in the southern hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In most industrialized countries, almost all of which are well north of rhe equator, in the northern hemisphere, the population increase is well below the 2-percent average for the world. Russia and the United States both have a rate of about 1.5 percent, while Europe has slightly less than a one-percent annual increase. But the picture in lands near the equator and in most of the southern hemisphere is far different. In Africa the rate is 2.4 percent annually. South America has an even higher rate of 2.8 percent. In some lands the rate has soared much higher. Costa Rica's population increases at the astounding rate of 4.3 percent each year; the Dominican Republic's, 3.6 percent. Also above 3 percent are El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Many countries in Africa and Asia are also well above the world average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Thus, while the populations of North America and Latin America were about the same a few years ago, population experts estimate that within thirty-five years Latin America would contain well over 630,000,000 persons, almost 300,000,000 more than in North America. Africa would have over 400,000,000 more than North America, and Asia would have over 2,000,000,000 more! Yet, Latin America, Africa and much of Asia are the very places where the problem is the most severe already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One of the countries critically affected is India. India has two and a half times the population of the United States. But India's 500,000,000 people occupy an area less than one-third that of the United States. India has, on the average, over four hundred inhabitants per square mile, while the United States has only fifty-five. Although India’s population is over seven times as dense as that of the United States, tier annual increase is more than four limes as great, being about twelve to fourteen million a year in an already impoverished country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Communist China has the largest population of any country on earth. It is estimated to be over 700,000,000. That is a density of about 187 persons per square mile, well below India’s. However, a large part of China is made up of mountainous areas such as Tibet, or desert areas, neither of which is favorable at the present time to large-scale habitation and cultivation. And China’s population explodes by approximately 15,000,000 persons each year, the largest increase of any nation on earth. So, as indicated on the cover of this magazine, a large proportion of earth’s population is Asiatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The problem of nations with a high density of population can be appreciated when we examine the comparatively abundant land available to the United States population of about 200,000,000. They inhabit an area of about three and a half million square miles. Excluding areas uninhabitable at present, there are roughly four acres of countryside available for each person, on the average. But in a little more than a century there would be just a half acre left at the present rate of increase. Yet, in other countries where the density of population is far greater, the available land would be much less. And world wide, it has been estimated that if the present rate of growth were to continue, there would be only one square yard of land available for each human in six hundred years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Also, as population explodes, the land area that can be used for cultivation will actually diminish even faster, because cities, dwellings, highways, industries ano public works take land away from food production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Pessimistic Outlook of Experts</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When experts view the future, they view it with pessimism. They realize that the problems already accompanying the current population explosion are not being solved. As the population continues to explode, so do the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This is true even in the more industrially advanced nations, where cities are grow<sup>1</sup> ing larger and becoming packed with people. Urban renewal has not generally kept pace with the deterioration evident within most large cities. And in the majority of instances, it is the poorer people who must live in the overcrowded, less desirable areas, because they cannot afford to live in the more comfortable sections of the city, or in the relatively affluent suburbs. Discontentment over living conditions causes tempers and tensions to mount, providing a fertile field for all kinds of social disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Indeed, crime is exploding many times as fast as the population in most industrialized nations. In the United States, the most technically advanced and materially prosperous nation in the world, during the first three months of 1967 crime exploded with a 20-percent increase compared to the same period last year! Nor is there any assurance at all that this will be relieved. All signs point to an aggravation of the situation. And although the United States rise in population is relatively low', yet </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font15"> of February 9. 1965, declared “The outlook as population grows is tor crisis doubled and redoubled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Also, rivers and air become more polluted due to chemical wastes and toxic gases from factories and millions of automobiles. This pollution has already become a health hazard in nearly every industrialized country. In addition, deaths due to automobile accidents mount, now' being about 50,000 annually in the United States alone. And automobiles are being built faster than highways or parking areas can comfortably and safely accommodate them, further adding to the frightful congestion and frustration already existing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That scientists are not optimistic about the future was noted in a seminar sponsored by the American Institute of Physics. After' the meeting, the following report was issued in the New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font15">of March 15, 1966: “Man appears to be losing his fight against drought, famine and air pollution despite 'exciting' scientific advances, a panel of specialists said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One of these specialists pointed to the most menacing aspect of the entire problem. As the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> related: “Dr. A. Richard Kassander, of Arizona University’s Institute for Atmospheric Physics, said: ‘We’re really kind of losing the race to grow food and increase water faster than the population grows.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This focuses attention on the most serious and most immediate of the problems: producing enough food to feed adequately the exploding human population of earth.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The dreaded tomorrow already has dawned&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font15">F YOU live in one of the more industrialized nations of the world, you likely eat two or three adequate meals a day. It may be difficult for you to appreciate that people who eat as well as you do are a small minority of earth’s population. Indeed, you probably have more leftover food from your daily meals than hundreds of millions of people eat each day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some analysts say</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I hat as many as eight out of ten of earth's inhabitants are undernourished. Almost all authorities agree that one-third to one-half of the world regularly suffers from hunger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For many years population and food experts have warned of impending disaster, saying that the population explosion would inevitably bring on famine conditions. Looking into the future, the London </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph and Morning Post</span><span class="font15"> said several years ago: “Shortage of food in many parts of the world may create a more serious situation than the hydrogen bomb.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The disaster predicted for the future, however, is not waiting for the future. It already has begun! An Associated Press report stated: “For some areas, the dreaded tomorrow already has dawned.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Science News</span><span class="font15"> also said in its issue of</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">July 30, 1966: “Some experts say the Great World Famine has already begun.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Previous Warnings Being Fulfilled</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That a food crisis already has begun was noted last year. A Buffalo </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font15"> editorial of February 25, 1966. stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">'‘With quiet persistence and chilling facts, a Buffalo expert on food production has been doing his utmost for many months to alert Congress, the public and the world at laree</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">to an impending global food crisis of potentially cataclysmic proportions. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;For, very simply, it is Dr. [Raymond] Ewell's thesis that the world Is rapidly running short of food; that, since 1960 the percapita production of food in Asia,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Africa and Latin America has been declining by 1% to 2% a year; that, if these trends continue for the next 10-15 years, mass starvation, on a scale never before experienced in the world's history, will inevitably result....</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“In India, Dr. Ewell told the committee, it is upon us now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The events of the last two years have confirmed these observations. The country of India now is experiencing its worst famine in recent history, perhaps ever. The New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> of April 19, 1967, declared in a headline: “Famine, Disease and Drought Sweep Bihar State in India, Affecting 40 Million.” An accompanying article stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;About 40 million of Bihar's 52 million people have suffered to some degree since the failure of last summer's monsoon set off tile worst drought in memory. However, Government officials and private relief workers agree that its worst effects are being felt only now. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Villagers have begun to die, either from starvation or from diseases they cannot overcome in their weakened condition. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;In the most remote villages of the Gaya and Monghyr districts, one can see the results: women so weak they can hardly drag themselves out of their huts to greet visitors and men with gaunt, haggard faces who break into tears and cry, &quot;Nothing in the stomach. Nothing in the stomach.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After making a tour of some of the affected areas, a reporter for the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times of India</span><span class="font15"> wrote the following account (April 20, 1967):</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;The worst famine of the century has reduced millions to moving skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Some cannot even move. They are on the verge of death. ... in the districts of Budh Gaya and Palamau, hundreds of thousands are in the grip of hunger and thirst that defy description. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;In a village called Baljnathpur, I encountered a farmer named Paguna and his wife Dakhya. They have five children. Children do not lie, and these little ones, looking like black skeletons with their eyes popping out, said they had not eaten since the previous evening. Their last meal was of boiled mahua flowers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In a normal year the Indian state of Bihar produces about 7.3 million tons of food grains and is given about a million tons more by the central government. But as a result of the drought brought on by the failure of the annual monsoon rains, the crop this year is not expected to exceed 2.8 million tons, perhaps less. Over two million tons of grain may be shipped to Bihar by the central government of India this year. However, while India as a whole will import about twelve million tons of grain this year for relief purposes, only about one-fifth of that can be given to famine-stricken Bihar, and it is not enough. Why? Because the Indian government needs the rest to hunger areas throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Due to the famine, the State of Bihar proclaimed a famine emergency, the first to be declared by any state government in India for the twenty years it has been an independent country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The dreaded catastrophe that has already dawned in India was also described by an on-the-spot report published in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News £ World Report</span><span class="font15"> of May 1. 1967. The reporter wrote:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">*' 'Tens of thousands of people are going to starve, no matter what we do,’ I was told by a member of a famine-relief team at work In this parched country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Said this man: ‘I can show you villages where people are gathering scum from stagnant ponds and mixing it with earth or cow dung to give it body and then eating it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Reports like this, heard over and over, reveal the utter desperation of the people here in the State of Bihar. . . . Nothing the average American has seen or been told could prepare him for such a visit. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;The crisis is not limited to Bihar. In Uttar Pradesh, to the west, you find areas where food is just as short as in Bihar's famine area. There are reports of similar conditions In parts of West Bengal, around Calcutta to the east, Orissa to the south, and Madhya Pradesh to the southwest. , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Americans here can see with their own eyes that no matter what is done this year, starvation and disease are going to reap a ghastly harvest in human lives. And. they warn, unless a whole new effort is made to Increase production from India's own land, the Bihar famine will be only a curtain raiser for what Is to come in the years ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Such grim reports are verified by our </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> correspondent in India who writes that even in Andhra Pradesh to the south twenty-five million people are face to face with famine. He notes that cases of suicide are mounting and relates: *'A father will administer poison to his entire family and then kill himself, unable to stand the strain of watching them gradually go into decline and die from lack of nourishment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">India Not Only Famine Area</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">While India is at present the most critical famine area in the world, it is not alone. In Africa and South America and other parts of Asia as well, famine conditions exist and worsen.</span></p><img src="g_E_19670908_files/g_E_19670908-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:205pt;height:132pt;">
<p><span class="font2">The areas in color get less than a minimum adequate diet</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Commenting on the possibility of alleviating this condition in hunger areas of Latin America, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font15"> of October 29, 1965, said; “Not unless a near miracle takes place, reports the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization. . . . More disturbing still, Latin America’s food production is slipping behind its population growth—to the point where this year’s projected per capita production will be 11% less than the prewar average.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Truly, the lands of almost the entire underdeveloped world, such as India, China, Iraq, Pakistan, Indonesia, Brazil and many others, are in a desperate plight. These underdeveloped nations constitute two-thirds of the earth's population, well over two thousand million people; they cannot feed these people, and yet they have exploding populations that experts predict will add another thousand million more mouths to feed by 1980.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Worry over Different &quot;Explosion&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Authorities in the field worry over what might happen when too many people find themselves without food and without hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This fear was expressed by an Associated Press dispatch under the title: “World’s starving millions may ignite explosion unless relief forthcoming.” It said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Because hungry people don't care how or by whom they are ruled—</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Because millions of children are doomed to die painfully of hunger—</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Because millions of others will grow up physically and mentally retarded from hunger—</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Because mass poverty of a third of all human beings is beyond the comprehension of rich countries—</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Because of all these things, a world calamity of vast proportions can be just around the corner. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Unchecked, the gathering catastrophe can bring disease, pestilence, revolution, perhaps more and crueler Viet Nams, perhaps even world war. It can threaten the security of the whole Western world. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Without combined effort by the rich nations, the world, as a U.S. agricultural economist, Prof. Earl Butz, has put it, 'is on a collision course.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“When the force of zooming population runs up against insufficient food production, there will be an explosion, says Butz, and 'unless we give increased attention now to the softening of the impending collision, many parts of the world within a decadewill be skirting a disaster of such proportions as to threaten the peace and stability ot the Western world.' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The wealthier nations now recognize the gathering storm. Their officials realize that the population and food crisis can bring on social explosions that would have a profound effect on all countries. No doubt that is an underlying reason for the fallowing report in the New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> of June 10, 1967:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;WASHINGTON (D.C.l.June &amp;—The Committee on the World Food Crisis demanded today that the Administration stop talking and start doing something about the onslaught of massive starvation throughout underdeveloped areas of the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Diminishing Stocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">However, while there is much concern, the hard, cold facts reveal that the world’s reserve stock of food is shrinking. Since 1961 each year has seen a drop in the. world's supply of grain left at the end of the year. From about. 136 million metric tons of grain in 1961 the year-end world supply shrank to about 73 million metric tons in 1966. And the estimate for 1967 is for only about 50 million metric tons left at the end of the year, a very small fraction of what is consumed annually throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Even in the United States the supply of reserve grain has shrunk. In 1961 an estimated 1.4 thousand million bushels of wheat were carried over to the next year. But in 1966 that reserve supply had decreased to less than half that, about 536 million bushels. The 1967 carry-over is estimated to be only 420 million bushels. Similar reductions have taken place in corn and other feed grains. If the cur rent crop were wiped out, those reserves would last the United States alone only about ninety days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Yet, the United States, Canada and Australia are about the only nations left that can still export any substantial amount of food to help fight world starvation. Formerly other areas did export food, but, as </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Science News</span><span class="font15"> states: “Over the past several years, large regions such as India. Africa and South America have had to change from exporting food to importing food.” Thus, only a handful of countries remain that have much food to export, and even their stockpiles have been reduced sharply due to huge exports to hungry lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Also, the world's food gap is widening. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font15"> of March 7, 1967, declared: “The world is running out of food. That is a fact of life, and of death. Not just death for the hundreds of thousands who are starving routinely today, but for hundreds of millions. . . We are now losing the race between available food and the growing number of stomachs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Yes, “the dreaded tomorrow already has dawned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font15">HAT does the future hold? Will the world see disaster or prosperity? The answer is that it will see both!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">To appreciate better why it can be said that both are in store, it would help to analyze briefly the causes for the present situation and the prospects for improvement,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">First of all, is it beyond the earth’s productive capacity to supply its current population with food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">/s </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">the. Earth at Fault?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">At present there is not enough food being produced to feed everyone properly. But does that mean the earth itself is at fault? Is the soil simply unable to sustain today's 3,400,000.000 people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">WTiile it is true that some areas are not producing good crops, it is not true that the soil is always at fault. What is at fault is the way the available soil has been handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For example, historians recognize that the area between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, called Mesopotamia, was once a very fruitful area, producing abundant crops. Today it is practically a desert. Did the soil turn bad? No, it was mismanaged. The fine irrigation systems from the Tigris and Euphrates were neglected gradually. Instead of the land's being cared for, it was increasingly exploited. And the nations of that area became more interested in world conquest than in taking care of the ground. As a result, the land deteriorated. It became a desert and could not be brought back to full production without a major effort.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DISASTER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROSPERITY?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">In many productive parts of the United States similar desert conditions would exist were it not for the efforts of conservation-minded agriculturalists. In California several large areas such as the Imperial and San Joaquin valleys would be bleak deserts if modern farming methods, proper irrigation and sufficient fertilizer had not been used. As a result of care of the soil these potential desert areas produce abundantly, their fruit products being among the best in the world. But if that same land were neglected or abused, it would turn into a vast wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That the earth is not primarily at fault, that there is enough good soil to feed today's world population, and many more, experts admit. Professor D. Bogue of the University of Chicago stated: “Given the present capacity of the earth for food production, and the potential for additional food production if modern technology were more fully employed, the human race clearly has within its grasp the capacity to chase hunger from the earth— within a matter of a decade or two.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &lt;&amp;&nbsp;World Report,</span><span class="font15"> January 2, 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Further, there is more land available than there are people to cultivate it properly. The Soviet Union is sparsely populated. It could hold millions more persons. Huge Canada’s population density is only about five persons per square mile, compared to Japan’s more than 680, India’s over 400, and Puerto Rico’s 754. Obviously, much territory is not being cultivated at all. The entire continent of Australia contains only about the same number of people as metropolitan Tokyo! Most of Africa, including many fertile areas, is relatively empty. It has been said that Rhodesia, with a population of slightly over four million, could support fifty million people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">World wide it is reported that only about a quarter of the arable land available is now undei' cultivation, and less than 10 percent in Latin America. Some experts on population matters even say that the earth could support a hundred thousand million persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">What Is at Fault?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">However, if the earth itself is not at fault, then what is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Geochemist Harrison Brown of the California Institute of Technology stated: &quot;Here indeed is the great potential tragedy of our age! Our science and our technology have given us the power to create a world in which virtually all people can lead free and abundant lives. We have the power to create a civilization as yet undreamed of in its beauty and its accomplishments. Yet somehow we can’t seem to organize ourselves to use that power effectively to solve mankind's basic problems.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Note that key point: &quot;We can't seem to organize ourselves to use that power effectively to solve mankind’s basic problems.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What is clearly at fault, then, is the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">system of things</span><span class="font15"> that prevails on earth today. The governmental, economic, social, racial and religious systems are not cooperating together sufficiently to solve mankind’s problems. There is no central control to distribute equally and unselfishly the earth’s resources. Instead, there are power blocs, national divisions, selfishness, greed and hatreds that fragment mankind and make solutions of its basic problems impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Example of India</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">All of this can be seen in the disaster now overtaking India. While it may be said that an immediate cause for India's famine is the lack of rainfall, still that is not the entire picture. Of late, even in good years, the crop has not been enough. The drought merely aggravated an already bad situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Is India’s land at fault? No, for that same land could produce many times the food that it does at present. Primitive farming methods, insufficient fertilizer and a lack of irrigation are some of the things that contribute to make India’s land far less productive than it should be. Wooden plows that only scratch the surface are used because peasants do not have the money to buy a modern plow. Even if they could obtain one, their hungry oxen could not pull it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">India’s religious attitude also contributes heavily to her condition. Hindus believe that cows are &quot;sacred,” descendants of a cow goddess. The population of these animals increases at a rate almost equal to the explosion of India's human population, and there are already about 250 million cattle in India. Many of these are diseased and underfed. Yet they roam unchecked through the land, an added severe drain on the scarce food supply. Nor will the Hindus eat these “sacred” cows, so a potential source of food goes untouched. It is unlikely that these animals will be either curbed or used for food in the near future. Last year riots resulting from the slaughter of such cows created a “national calamity” and threatened another religious war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Poor administration in the distribution of available supplies has added to the difficulty, as has corruption and greed. Also, the Hindu teaching of “karma” hinders progress. This teaching says that whatever a person suffers in this life is a result of what he has done in a previous life. If he wants to obtain grace, “dharma,” then he must accept his fate. This fatalism has resulted in a grave lack of initiative on the part of many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That it is the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">system of things</span><span class="font15"> that is primarily at fault was noted in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font15"> magazine this year. It stated: “There is no doubt that man has the technical capacity to lift food production around the globe. But modern, scientific farming involves fundamental changes in the social structure of a nation, and that is a painfully slow process. Illiterate peasants are not likely to respond quickly to the demands of either scientific agriculture or family planning.” Such has been the case in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Also, in spite of her pressing problems India has spent thousands of millions of dollars on armaments and has fought a costly war with Pakistan, which country also has population and food problems. Similarly, China has clashed with India. In all of this, resources that could have been used to aid agriculture have been diverted to nonproductive purposes. Over 40 percent of India’s budget this year will be for armaments!</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Some countries, particularly the United States, are sending substantial amounts of grain, helping India to avoid total disaster. But even in the famine areas, the small relief rations amount to only about 600 calories a day for many, far below adequate levels. And it is not really solving the problem. As Professor of Sociology Nathan Keyfitz of the University of Chicago stated: “How different the case would be if the United States had given fertilizer factories rather than wheat. Then more grain could sprout on the Asian countryside, and there would be no reason for the peasants to accumulate in the city beyond the needs of industrial growth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Sadly, these handouts have encouraged many peasants to leave the land and flock</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">the cities, where food distribu-is centered. Instead of being producers, they become only consumers and worsen the situation. They are also robbed of their dignity by being reduced to the status of a nearbeggar, unable or unwilling to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Years ago India should have been helped where it would have been the most effective, in farming methods, modern implements, fertilizer factories and irrigation projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Part of India’s dilemma stems from her colonial background. Under the colonial regime relatively little effort was made to combat illiteracy among India’s masses so they could eventually help themselves. Elsewhere, too, the colonial powers have had a poor record in the lands they previously held in Asia, Africa and South America. As Professor Keyfitz stated: “Western governments and electorates sense the tragic state of affairs, and at least vaguely feel responsible for this aftermath of colonialism, and so we provide food and other kinds of aid.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Yes, the basic cause for India’s dilemma and the world’s dilemma is the controlling </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">system of things.</span><span class="font15"> It does not work for the benefit of all. It is simply not arranged to aid underdeveloped nations overcome their population and food problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Colossal Waste</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The time, energy, money and resources that are spent for constructive aid are dwarfed by the colossal expenditures devoted to implements of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The nations of this system of things are spending fantastic amounts on weapons of war. The United States alone spent about seventy thousand million dollars on armaments last year, more than half her annual budget! This colossal and tragic waste of resources each year makes the amounts spent on helping the hungry pale into insignificance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And even within the boundaries of wealthy nations that are spending so much on armaments, what do we find? A New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> headline of June 17, 1967, reads: &quot;Severe Hunger Pound in Mississippi.” The report said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;A team of doctors who recently returned from Mississippi told Congress today that they had found hunger approaching starvation and serious untreated diseases among hundreds of Negro children there. . . . They described the health of the poor children there as 'pitiful.' 'alarming,* 'unbelievable' and 'appalling.* . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;The doctors' report continued: 'We do not want to quibble over words, but &quot;malnutrition'' is not quite what we found; the boys and girls we saw were hungry—weak, in pain, sick: their lives are being shortened</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">They are suffering from hunger and disease and directly or indirectly they are dying from them—which is exactly what &quot;starvation” means.' . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;'It is fantastic,’ [one doctori said, 'that this should be so in the wealthiest nation in the world—the wealthiest nation that ever was.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That the present system of things world wide is not working for the good of all mankind, even a United States Senator acknowledged. Writing in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font15"> of March 7, 1967, he stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;It is not that the earth lacks the capacity, or modern farmers the know-how, to 'produce subsistence for men,' but rather that governments lack the will and the courage to bend their efforts to the task. Horrified historians may record that as the world sped on a collision course with starvation, its great powers fiddled with a war in Vietnam, a crisis in Berlin, a contest in arsenal building and a race to the moon, , .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;In Vietnam, we are willing to pour a million dollars In ammunition into the jungle if one VC [Viet Cong] sticks up his head. .But hunger threatens to swallow civilization and we are hesitant to mount a solid counteroffensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Everybody is talking about it, and nobody is in charge, . . . Where is the General Westmoreland to lead the war on hunger? Where is the necessary incentive to farmers and technicians? Where is the Manila Conference to rally allies among other affluent nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;We are spending seven-tenths of one percent of our gross national product for food and development assistance. This is only one-sixth the cost of our military operations in Vietnam (which is still only a part of total armament costs].&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The nations of this system of things have spent astronomical amounts year after year for armaments. Aside from that, the current race to the moon will cost the United States over forty thousand million dollars, and no doubt Russia will spend a similar amount. This while famine stalks the earth, and conditions within the wealthy nations themselves cry out for improvement. Such resources, had they been spent on the population and food crisis, could have had remarkable results. Why, just last year’s United States armament expenditure could have provided 14,000,000 homes costing $5,000 each in the poorer countries’ Or it could have provided a salary' of $5,000 for that many teachers to educate the illiterate masses throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But the money devoted to armaments is not being spent for the benefit of mankind, nor is it </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">likely to be spent.</span><span class="font15"> Why not? Because the present system of things on earth is simply too selfish, too full of political and economic greed. Indeed, the kind of aid required has been in a declining trend. One population authority said: “We are faced, however, by the sad fact that for the past five years aid contributions from these countries have remained static. Indeed, as a proportion of their incomes, aid contributions have decreased from 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Prospects for Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A crash program of capital investments of titanic proportions is needed to increase food production in poorer countries. But of this a panel of experts related the following facts, published in the New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font15"> of June 18, 1967:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Since the main hope for increasing food production in the poor countries was through increased yield per unit of land, there could be no substitute for this higher investment in improved seed, fertilizers, pesticides, ma chinery and water fur irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Even more difficult would be the vast educational and training programs required to create, distribute and properly use modern crop production input end the transporta tion to distribute, process and market the output of farms . , .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Even under the most favorable circum stances the interval between the inauguration of such programs and their realization in the form of increased production of crops will be at least 5 to 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;It is by no means certain that this task can be accomplished to the extent or nt the rate needed to meet food requirements during the next two decades, even with ;■ 'warlike'mobilization of the developed countries.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The tremendous crash program needed is not even in the planning stage! And there is no assurance at all that it will ever be undertaken or implemented in this divided world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Along with any increase in food production, experts agree that the skyrocketing population must be curbed in the future. In a few countries the birthrate has been lowered, partly by new birth-control methods. For example, in the United States it is now acknowledged that th? &quot;baby boom” of the last two decades has come to an end, at least temporarily. The number of births in 1966 (3,629,000) was the lowest since 1950. However, as more of the postwar baby crop reaches maturity, experts predict, total births will rise again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Japan an exploding population ha? been brought largely under control, as the annual increase is barely one percent. But the decrease in the birthrate is not altogether due to birth-control measures. In large part it is due to legalized abortion. It is admitted that Japan has at least as many abortions as live births.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">However, countries such as Japan and the United States are among the wealthier nations. They do not have the severe population and food problems that the underdeveloped two-thirds of the world has. In those areas, the critical areas, the population explosion is not at all being halted. Food production is not being raised. Nor is the aid given them enough to halt their downward plunge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Truly, the entire system of governments, societies and ideologies is proving inadequate. And the religious and national barriers are hampering progress. It all simply means that the population and food crisis is not being solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But does this mean there is no solution? Does it mean that the future is hopeless? Not at all! On the contrary, the population and food crisis will be solved without fail, and that in the immediate future!</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font15">HAT does mankind need to solve the population and food crisis? What is needed is a central authority that can marshal all the resources of the earth and justly and fairly use them for the benefit of all mankind, without wasting them in war, without individual and collective greed making a shambles of such efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Will this ever be done? Without doubt the population and food crisis positively will be solved, and within this very generation! </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">But not by means of this present system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">This System on the Way Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For nearly 6,000 years of human history, mankind, for the most part, has carried on in its own ways, outside the direction of the Creator, Jehovah God. Rather than submitting to direction by God, man has rebelled and sought out his own paths independently from his Maker. In all this time God has wisely permitted man’s experiment in rebellion and independence. Today, we can clearly see the sad results of man’s independent thinking and activity. Proved beyond a doubt is what the prophet Jeremiah was inspired to write: “I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. Correct me, O Jehovah, however with judgment.&quot;—Jer. 10: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Almighty God is going to do just that. Not forever will He permit this system to go its own destructive way. God has set a time limit for this system of things, and that time limit is almost up. This system has had its opportunity to administer man’s affairs, and it has failed to bring peace, blessings and prosperity. Soon God will call it to account and bring it into judgment. He will execute his perfectly righteous decisions in accordance with what individuals and organizations have done to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What have men done to the soil, to one another and to the animal kingdom? Have they used earth’s resources for the good of all? Or have they gone on in their own selfish, destructive way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The record of history is that mankind has made a monumental mess of governing this earth. Men have abused earth’s natural resources, they have worked for selfish advantage at the expense of their fellowman, and they have spilled the blood of millions of innocent persons in fiendish, wasteful warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God’s time for executing his judgments on this unrighteous system of things nears. Of this time, Bible prophecy states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“The nations became wrathful, and [God’s] own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” </span><span class="font14">—Rev. 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That is the true meaning of the world’s pitiful condition today. We are nearing the end of this system of things, a system that has brought such tragedy to all mankind, that is progressively breaking down before our very eyes. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) One of the many evidences that positively identify our generation as being in the “last days&quot; was given by Jesus Christ in his famous prophecy about the end of this system of things. He foretold that &quot;there will be food shortages ... in one place after an-other.&quot;—Matt. 24:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">things. The psalmist, writing under inspiration by God, foretold:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;And just a little while longer, and the Wicked one will be no more___he will not be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. . ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.&quot; —Ps. 37:9-11, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">By bringing this system of things to an end, with one swift stroke God will solve the population crisis. There will then be no more exploding population. Only honest-hearted persons will continue to live, but in a </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">new system of things,</span><span class="font15"> a new arrangement of human society on earth governed by Almighty God through a heavenly kingdom, a heavenly government. This is the literal government for which Jesus Christ told his followers to pray. (Matt. 6:9, 10) It is the government that ancient Hebrew prophets knew would take control of all earth’s affairs and administer them the right way. Of this government, the prophet Daniel said:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15">Jesus foretold that within our very generation Jehovah God, Creator of heaven and earth, will directly intervene in man’s affairs and “bring to ruin those ruining the earth” by destroying the entire present wicked system of things along with its promoters. —Matt. 24:3-14, 34-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Yet, those who have respect for what is right, who are willing to submit to God and his righteous laws that benefit everybody, will be permitted to live through the coming execution of this old system of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">&quot;And in the days of those kings [in existence in our time) the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”—Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Unequaled Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After God ushers in his new system of things in heaven and on earth and takes complete control of all earth’s affairs, then what? Then righteousness will extend throughout the earth. As the apostle Peter stated: &quot;There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Under a righteous administration obedient mankind will work in loving cooperation with one another as well as with their Creator. People will be organized earth wide under God’s one government so that all persons can benefit equally from earth’s rich resources. There will not then be some rich and some poor, some well fed and some starving. God will make a banquet for </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font15"> peoples, without discrimination or prejudice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&quot;Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples, in tills mountain, a banquet of . . . well-oiled dishes filled with marrow, of wine kept on the dregs, filtered. ... He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.&quot;—Isa. 25:6, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Creator guarantees that death, hunger and unhappiness will be eliminated in that new system. No more will men have to struggle with the earth, only to be buried underneath it eventually. They will be able to live forever and observe the earth produce bountifully as they work it under God's direction. &quot;There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.” (Ps. 72:16) Indeed, mankind's needs will be completely satisfied under that central government for all the earth. The inspired psalmist said: &quot;You [God are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.”—Ps. 145:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Under God's righteous government and under the loving care of unselfish men, the earth will be transformed gradually into a literal paradise, providing all its inhabitants with the best of material benefits for their eternal happiness. All the bad conditions of today will be eliminated. No more will there be overcrowding, poor housing and hunger. No more will mothers bear children and raise them to maturity only to have to send them off to be slaughtered by selfish rulers. No more will armaments races be permitted to waste earth’s resources and drench the soil with blood while millions starve.—Ps. 46:8, 9; Isa. 2:3. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Thus, within this very generation, an age of plenty will begin that has had no parallel throughout man's history! It will be a new system of things that will forever bring to an end population and food problems. Then earth's population will never go beyond comfortable limits or outrace the available food supply. God will see to it that human procreation is kept within the bounds he sets so that every person will enjoy the productive earth and the fruits of his labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Do Not Be Misled</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God's new system is the only and sure answer to the population and food crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Do not be misled by high-sounding words, even well-intentioned promises, by men in this system of things. The Almighty God, Jehovah, says that this system and its leaders will utterly fail to solve mankind's grave problems. He tells us that men alienated from God will become ever move deeply mired in their problems, until God intervenes and rips control of earth’s affairs from them. —Luke 21:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">So, instead of focusing your attention and hope on false remedies, focus them on the only One who has the power and the will to solve the population and food crisis. Jehovah God. As His Word encourages: &quot;Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off. you will see it.”—Ps. 37:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God’s time for cutting off this wicked system of things nears. His time for ushering in his righteous new system thus also nears. Take advantage of the remaining time to learn about it so that you can enjoy its benefits, so that you can live in the coming age of plenty.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Latin America?</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15"><sup>r</sup>pHE rank and file of baptized Catholics </span><span class="font19">1 </span><span class="font15">in Latin America are more and more falling into a state of apathy as regards religion. For example, in Ecuador, officially dedicated in 1873 to the &quot;Sacred Heart of Jesus” and in 1892 to the &quot;Immaculate Heart of Mary,” the attitude of the public has undergone a remarkable change within the past few years. The Roman Catholic Church has definitely lost much of its influence over the lives of Ecuadorians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Peru, too, recent visitors noted that the churches there are no longer the center of family life. At the hours when mass is being said, people will be grouped together watching television or off for a day at the beach. The showmanship of processions at special fiestas still attracts the crowds, but people then quickly lapse back into the religious apathy that is gradually enveloping them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Uruguay a veil of indifference and sheer lack of interest in religious matters seems to have settled down over the people. One has only to mention such words as “God,” &quot;Bible” and &quot;religion” to close down a conversation, for many people do not care to discuss such questions. The majority of the men are agnostics or atheists. The same general trend is seen in Brazil, where the people are often Catholic in name only. There is a growing gulf between clergy and people. Fewer than 10 percent of Brazilians attend Sunday mass, and in parts of the country where Catholicism was strongly entrenched there is a noticeable turning away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That religion is losing its hold on Chileans was admitted by priest Ignacio Garcia when he spoke before a forum in Santiago: “The priest is a bridge .. . and the people do not want to cross it. What is happening on the bridge? We take off the cassock, we speak Spanish [in compliance with ecumenical developments] and nobody crosses the bridge, as though getting to the other side no longer interests them.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Vea,</span><span class="font15"> Santiago, Chile, November 24, 1966) In Argentina it is estimated that no more than 5 percent of the Catholics “make their Easter duty,” that is, comply with the church’s requirements as to fasting, confessing and attending mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Bolivia’s Indian population has dutifully observed the rites of the Roman Catholic Church for more than four hundred years. It now becomes evident that theirs has been a purely mechanical expression without any deep-down intellectual appreciation. Says Werner Krauss, professor at the German High School in La Paz: “Even today one cannot note any definite inclination toward Christianity [on the part of the Indian]. The result is that the impotent temples spread throughout the land have not accomplished their task and their deteriorating fronts are not merely the effect of poverty and time, but also constitute a symbol.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(El Diorio,</span><span class="font15"> La Paz, October 28, 1966) A symbol of what? Of the apathetic attitude of Bolivians toward religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Venezuela, too, an attitude of apathy toward the church is especially noticeable among the men. They will often express the opinion that religion is only for women and children. Time after time missionaries who visit the people in their homes are told: “I do not understand my own Catholic religion, so how can I understand another?&quot; The youth are turning to atheism and science as substitutes for a religion they cannot respect. The mounting disrespect may be gauged by the increasing number of thefts from church treasuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Seeking the Explanation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A variety of reasons are offered in explanation of this trend toward religious apathy. For example, in his book </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming Explosion in Latin America,</span><span class="font15"> Canadian journalist Gerald Clark declares that “the hierarchy in general, and many parish priests, cling to a Middle Ages mentality that supports the traditional landowners and preaches that man’s reward comes in afterlife.” He also reminds readers that &quot;the Church remained aloof from the material problems of its converts and opposed to social changes. In the process it amassed a great fortune. By the nineteenth century the Church, through gifts, tithes, and other revenues, owned between one third and one half of all private property in the colonies. It also directed education.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The same author goes on to reveal that “in parts of Ecuador peasants have to pay merely for the ringing of funeral bells.” There, too, according to the same writer, “twenty-five percent of the husband-wife couples admit to living out of wedlock because they cannot raise enough money for a marriage ceremony. In Colombia, where a church wedding costs on the average fifty pesos, or four dollars (more than most </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">campesinos</span><span class="font15"> earn in a month), half the children are illegitimate.” Pointing to the fact that, though 90 percent of the slum children in Lima, Peru are baptized, only 9 percent of their parents go to mass, journalist Clark observes: “If the adults feel that children shoulc be started in a righteous direction, the same compulsion does not motivate their own later lives, particularly since formal worship involves financial cost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Among youth a cynical attitude toward the church develops as they note that, no matter how great the enormity of the crimes committed by church members, they are still received and accepted by the church. Women known to be promiscuous are not excommunicated. Murderers, thieves, liars and adulterers still receive the rites of the church. Those who can afford to make an adequate contribution in money or in kind are readily absolved of their sins and find it easy to repeat the same offenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">According to a social worker with the Venezuelan Children’s Court, “the conditions of life in Venezuela become more difficult each day due to crime, use of drugs, sexual abuses, laziness; all this . , . is partially the result of parental apathy due to ignorance and lack of moral authority.” She spoke of women living with as many as fourteen different men in rotation and having children by each one. Of 350 cases she had handled, only 60 children were legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Lack of confidence in the sincerity of the clergy is also a factor. Here are a few representative statements by churchgoers and others in Latin America: “I go to church to pray to God but I do not confess to the priests because they are as sinful as other men.&quot; &quot;The priests are ministers of God in church, but outside of church they are like other men.&quot; “Without a doubt one should logically have some religion, and if Catholic, then one should receive instruction, but that priests are saintly men is not even to be imagined.&quot; And a young girl declared: &quot;Frankly, I have no desire to go to church, and considering what is said about the priests, I would never confess to one of them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Powerful Outside Factors</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Outside factors are also affecting the attitude of Catholics. The action of certain Latin-American governments toward liberalizing education and depriving the church of some of its monopolies is having a profound effect. As stated by George Pendle in his book </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Uruguay,</span><span class="font15"> page 101: &quot;The influence of the Catholic Church on family life has been weakened not only by the impossibility of imparting religious instruction to the majority of the children at school, but also by the fact that the Church marriage ceremony is not compulsory, and by the state’s recognition of divorce, which is now fairly common.&quot; Many have thus been relieved of an excessive dependence on the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The current policy of ecumenism, largely forced upon the church by developments of history, is also seriously affecting the attitude of Catholics toward their religion. A large segment of the younger priests are agitating for swifter implementation of the rulings of Vatican Council II. Ultraconservative bishops, on the other hand, show no disposition to hasten a change in the status quo. Even where some of the directives of the Council are being put into effect, what is the result? In Peru, where rhe people have been strongly in favor of mass in their own language, many, after a few months of listening, have noticed how little information is really being given them. There is now no mystery about it. Few go to the confessional booths anymore. Materialism has made them both independent and unwilling to submit their lives to another in this manner. The youth of today just do not want to be dominated by the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Basic Cause of Apathy</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That there is something radically wrong with the church's teaching program is now being admitted by her own representatives. Confessed priest Griffiths of Peru: “The blame is ours, be it the Church or society, because we did not know how to teach them.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(La Prensa,</span><span class="font15"> Lima, November 15, 1958) And Carlos Oviedo Cavada, bishop of Concepcion, Chile, admits: “Many of the means we are using have continued to be ineffectual in reaching th° people. We are conscious of our defects in our method of teaching doctrine, especially as concerns children and</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">youth. The defect in preaching that is so common in the Church, which has not adapted itself to the mind of today; the defect of a liturgy that is incomprehensible to the great mass of Catholics. All these elements have been operating to the point where many Catholics no longer live according to the principles of their faith, and finally become indifferent to it.”—</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">El Sur,</span><span class="font15"> Concepcion, October 9. 1966.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">However, it takes laymen to put their finger on a basic cause for much of today’s apathy. Journalist Alfonso Rumazo Gonzalez writes: ‘‘The Bible being the most, celebrated book in history, it is little known and studied among Catholics in its most extensive volume, the ‘Old Testament,’ which constitutes about four fifths of the whole. . , . All of it, nevertheless, will be of interest to the believer . . . This great book, the sum of books, should not be lacking in any home, Christian or not.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">—El Universal,</span><span class="font15"> Caracas, Venezuela, January 20, 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">People need an authoritative, changeless guide for all the exigencies of life, something that has not been supplied by the religious “commands of men.” (Matt. 15:9) Even now, when an era of wider education has forced the church to raise its prohibition against Bible reading, Bible distribution by Catholic agency is minimal, and the prices asked are beyond the ability of the workingman to pay. And any Bibles that are distributed by church agency have little effect, for there is no serious effort to follow through and offer aid to the people in getting an understanding and in applying the Bible principles in their lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">As it is, every change in church dogma and ritual introduced by the current wave of ecumenism raises a host of embarrassing questions and complaints: Why is this change necessary? If the old way was not right, why was it carried on for so long? Were the priests lying when they told us it was a sin to eat meat on Fridays? Is it possible they are telling still other lies? One woman says: “I am still a Catholic but I admit I haven’t gone back to church, because many things that were considered holy now have little importance.” Another says: “I’m not in agreement with the changes because sacred things should not be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The church faces a dilemma. No matter what it now does it meets with scathing criticism. Gone are the days of submissive &quot;children of the church.” People are asking intelligent questions, questions the church can no longer satisfy or put off. And as the satisfying answers are not forthcoming, people turn away in disgust and lapse into a deeper apathy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">A Stimulating Alternative</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">However, there is an alternative for God-fearing people in Latin America and throughout the world. There are ministers who are not at all indifferent to the Bible’s message, ministers who are busily engaged in spreading its stimulating message, not alone by placing Bibles in the hands of spiritually starved persons, but also by offering to conduct free Bible studies so that people can both learn and apply in their lives the fine, clean principles of God’s written Word. As Jehovah’s witnesses conduct their educational service they are happy to note that not all react with indifference or apathy. Many Latin Americans, in fact, are so appreciative of the things they are learning from the Bible that they are taking steps to clean up their lives, legalize their marriages and comply with God's requirements as to honesty and cleanliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In one South American country alone Jehovah’s witnesses distributed, in three years, more than 25,000 copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures in modern Spanish. They now eagerly anticipate spreading the complete Bible in modern Spanish throughout all of Latin America, using the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font15"> Apathy will continue to grip those who refuse to learn about God’s remedy for suffering humankind, but those who hear and heed what his written Word has to tell them will lift up their heads and rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">'Dccuak—O^ettaiue, yet &quot;Detce&amp;uA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awak»!&quot; csrrtipondenl in the Philippine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ttXXTHAT is that horrible smell?&quot; W thought Maria, as she checked around expecting to discover some overlooked garbage. Soon her eyes fell on a round package on the kitchen table, and as she hurriedly investigated its contents the odor grew even more offensive. The contents—a large coconutshaped green fruit, its prickly rind covered with warts and tubercles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Just then Juan came in and, sizing up the situation, said: “I see you came across the durian I brought you from Mindanao. What do you think of it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Well, Marla wanted to throw it out right away, but Juan assured her that tills was a special delicacy, good enough to have earned the title &quot;king of fruits.” In spite of the disagreeable odor, she agreed to sample it. Upon cutting it open she found it contained five oval compartments, each filled with creamcolored pulp in which were embedded a number of seeds the size of chestnuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And what was the taste of this unusual fruit? Here is how one inquisitive sampler described it: &quot;It's like a rich butteriike custard highly flavored with almonds, but intermingled with it come wafts of flavor that call to mind cream cheese, onion sauce, brown sherry.&quot; So perfectly balanced is the flavor that It cannot be described as acid, sweet or</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">juicy. Can you imagine Marias pleasant surprise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And where does this fruit come from? It comes from the durian tree, somewhat like a pear tree, but having oblong, tapering leaves with their bases rounded. The fruit grows in bunches, and when they ripen, like coconuts, they are likely to drop. It would be dangerous to get hit by one. The odor of the plant itself does not impress one as being so bad, but shortly after the fruit is harvested it becomes very offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is said that Elizabeth 1 of England, having heard of this strange fruit, ordered some to be brought back to her from its native region, parts of southeast Asia and the southern Philippines. When the ship was halfway home with the royal order, the sailors threatened mutiny because the ripened durian was filling the whole ship with its stench. &quot;Either throw the stuff overboard or we mutiny!&quot; was the ultimatum. The queen never did get to satisfy her curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Today airlines refuse to have it aboard, even when tightly packed. In hotels it is taboo. However, there are other forms in which it may yet become available, and the College of Agriculture in the University of the Philippines is now studying the possibilities.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">husband lets his opinions influence her selection of clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The fact that women’s fashions are so varied and change so often leads many to wonder why one woman may appear chic and another plain. It is not always the money spent on clothes, for some with limited funds are well dressed while others with larger amounts to spend may seem drab by comparison. When a woman gives attention to the line and fit of her clothes, the color scheme and the accessories worn with them, her clothes will usually look good on her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Colors and Styles</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Colors of clothing have their effect. The color red. for instance, has long been synonymous with gaiety and cheerfulness; while pale blues and greens have a soothing effect. Purples, dark grays and especially black can be depressing, and so it is no wonder that when these latter colors are worn on a dark, dismal day, a woman may feel somewhat “down.” Black, in particular, is a paradox. Although it has long been the symbol of death and mourning in many countries, it can also be flattering to some persons. The one color that is perhaps more flattering than any other, for all skin tones, hair shades and ages, is sky blue.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font15">ever opens her mouth. Sometimes they tell more than she realizes or wishes to convey. They can reveal femininity or lack of it, quiet modesty or extreme egotism, as well as the value she puts on cleanliness and neatness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Clothes can also reflect attitudes toward a mate. A wife who is eager to please her</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">For a woman to determine what colors are best suited to her physical makeup, she has to experiment, taking note of the ones that set her off to the best advantage. Blondes and redheads, for instance, have to use more care with the colors that are closest to the color of their hair, which tend to make them look pale and bland. The gray haired find that most blues and paler colors are more flattering than bright, harsh tones. Brunettes have a wider range and are able to wear most colors to good advantage. Where one lives also is a matter for consideration, since women in some countries are more inclined to wear brighter, gayer colors. Especially is this so of the sunny, warm climates, where the people’s clothing and dispositions often seem to reflect the sunlight they receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There are many things a woman can do to present a more attractive picture of herself through her clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">She can learn to tone down her weak features and highlight hex’ good ones, letting her clothes work for her instead of the other way around. For example, if a woman’s arms are large, she would avoid most sleeveless garments, which emphasize them. If her neck is short, she might want to wear necklines that lengthen her neck; high collars if her neck is long. Straight skirts give a slenderizing appearance to large hips, while gathers and pleats improve appearance if one is too slim. Particular attention must be given to lines: vertical lines appear to slenderize, while horizontal ones do not enhance the large frame. Dark colors tend to have a slenderizing effect, while the lighter ones have the opposite effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Good grooming usually centers around little things. A woman who wears too much jewelry or makeup or one who wears curlers in her hair out of doors is not well groomed. Also, a woman who wears her clothes too tight, no matter how good her figure, is never really well dressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Vital to good grooming is personal hygiene, and it mainly requires soap and water. The most priceless pearls will not offset a dirty sweater; nor will clean clothes on a dirty body. Bitten or dirty nails can be just as distasteful as rundown or unshined shoes. So cleanliness is essential to good grooming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Styles, on the other hand, vary almost with each country. A prevalent custom in one place might be taboo in another. When one considers that clothes often reflect the moral climate of the times, some styles speak poorly for this present generation. So local custom would not be the final criterion for all. Especially is this true of Christian women throughout the world who refrain from wearing styles that mirror the moral decay of the time. They dress in a modest and dignified way that befits women who reverence God. —1 Tim. 2:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Art of Shopping</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Once a woman has learned what styles and colors are best suited to her personality and pocketbook, the next step is knowing how to shop for them. The most logical one from whom to learn this art is one’s mother, and the earlier the better. As a daughter is taken to market and taught how to shop for food, she can also learn about clothes. She learns the value of sales, how to judge materials, where and when to find bargains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One learns that the core of a wardrobe should be composed of certain basic clothes that flatter. A good basic suit and dress are musts for a well-balanced wardrobe. Some women think they must restrict their buying to many inexpensive clothes rather than a few good-quality ones because the styles change from year to year. However, one fine-quality dress of simple design will often outlast three or four’ low-priced ones and will probably always look good no matter what the current style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The true value of a purchase, then, might be calculated by the price paid for it, divided by the times it is actually worn and the pleasure it gives the wearer. Something bought on sale for $9.95, marked down from $30, and never worn is much more expensive in the long run than an item costing two to three times that purchase price but worn often and valued highly because of the way it looks and the pleasure it gives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One also learns to add variety and spice to basic clothes by the accessories worn with them. A stunning pin can transform a plain dress, as can beads, belts and scarves. Different designs and colors can add pleasure to the wardrobe without robbing it of its basic elements, and purchasing items in colors that can be interchanged and worn together is a boon to those with a limited budget. This is why one must think of the entire wardrobe as one shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Honesty with oneself is another must in shopping. Something that looks good on a mannequin may not necessarily look good on the purchaser. That is why you should never leave a store with somethin&quot; that does not fit well. A shoe that hurts you on a carpeted floor in the store will play havoc with your feet on a hot pavement. And a hat that looks better on a saleslady than it does on you will probably end up, unused, in your closet. So, unless you are satisfied with your prospective purchase in the store, leave it ihere I</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some women spend much less on clothes than others because they buy almost everything on sale, knowing where and when to shop for the best bargains. In large cities, the same article can be $10 to $15 more in one store than in another. It is usually best to shop around and compare prices, avoiding spur-of-the-moment buying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Knowing when to shop is also beneficial. Price reductions can usually be found at the end of each season. Knowing when to shop is one thing; having self-control is another. It might be defined as the ability to admire something in a window or on a rack without fulfilling the urge to buy. Can you do this? You will if you shop for your needs instead of your wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Care of Clothes</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">All the wise savings realized in purchasing will soon be lost if the clothes do not receive the proper care. This depends not only on the space one has but on the use to which it is put. Even though the space be limited, if one’s closet is neatly arranged and well organized, it can fulfill one’s needs. Having one’s clothes within easy reach is certainly helpful: shoes all in one place, perhaps boxed and labeled; suits, coats, dresses—all hung together according to their kind; each season's clothes together, and so forth. Also, giving attention to brushing and airing one’s clothes and hanging them properly will add to the life of the garment. Carelessly hung articles will necessitate unnecessary ironing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">No matter how much care a garment receives, the day will come when one musi make the decision—to throw out or not to throw out! An honest appraisal should follow. Is it still usable? Am I reaily going to wear it again? Can it be converted to some other use?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">If all of one's clothes are to give pleasure, one must know when to discard the old ones and make room for the new. Some have found that taking periodic inventories can help. Perhaps twice a year —as spring begins and summer ends—one could take an objective inventory to determine what clothes are to be discarded and what kept; which ones need altering and which are in good condition. A rule tliat many women follow is to discard anything not worn for two years or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Truly a woman's clothes tell much about her. They reveal her wisdom in shopping and in buying the styles and colors that are best suited to her. They also reveal the care she gives them once they are hers. Whether you like it or not, your clothes tell much about you</span></p><img src="g_E_19670908_files/g_E_19670908-14.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:118pt;">
<p><span class="font20">M</span><span class="font15">ANY persons lack confidence in the effectiveness of prayer. They feel uneasy about engaging in prayer. Is that understandable? Yes, for doubtless they have heard of so many unanswered prayers, and, further, they have heard many insincere prayers rhymed off like memorized poetry. They are at a loss to know just what to say and how to say it in prayer to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God is not like the haughty rulers among meh who can be reached only through a multitude of influential agents. In your Bible you can turn to Acts 17; 27 and read the exhortation to seek after God “though he be not far from every one of us.&quot; </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Authorized Version)</span><span class="font15"> And is it not heartening to know that “the eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their cry for help&quot;? (Ps. 34:15) So God is truly approachable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But do you notice that it is “the righteous ones&quot; that get a hearing? That means those who strive to conform their lives to the will of God as expressed in his Book, the Bible. It is his will that all prayers be directed to him, the Sovereign Ruler of the whole universe. Thus Jesus taught his followers to pray, saying: “Our Father in the heavens.&quot; (Matt. 6:9) Then, too, it is necessary for all petitions to be presented before the heavenly-throne in the name of Jesus, the sole mediator between God and men. (1 Tim. 2:5) To this effect are Jesus' own words of encouragement to his disciples: “If you ask rhe Father for anything he will give it to you in my name. Until this present time you have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask and you will receive, that your joy may lie full.&quot;—John 16: 23. 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">* Does this mean that just anything can be requested, with certainty of being granted? No, because asking in the name of Jesus means asking by and under his authority. So we should not pray' for anything that runs counter to the purposes of God. When we examine Jesus' prayer to his heavenly Father during the supreme test of his integrity, we find Jesus saying: “My Father, if it is possible, li t this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.” (Matt. 26:39) We, too, then, should qualify our prayer to God with “if it be your will.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">' Far from limiting his prayers to just his own needs, Jesus prayed on behalf of other worshipers of God and for multitudes who were still seeking to learn God’s will. (John 17:9, 20) Not only did he teach about God’s kingdom, but he taught his disciples to pray for its coming. (Matt. 6:10) If, now, you pray for that kingdom to come, just as he did, then you must be in harmony' with the objectives of that kingdom, one of which is expressed in Daniel's prophecy, chapter two, verse 44: &quot;It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [of this wicked world], and it itself will stand to times indefinite.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> How inconsistent it would be to pray for that kingdom to come, and at the same time by word and act advocate rhe perpetuation of the kingdoms of this world! Likewise it would no: be Christ-like to join in with all the prayer weeks and prayer movements of this world, wherein the selfish interests of men are put to the fore and God is asked to put his blessing upon preconceived plans of men. Rather, we should pray that God's will may be done on earth as well as in heaven.—-Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">’ As a respectful son speaks to his parents, so the worshiper of Jehovah God can speak in prayer to the heavenly Father. No special religious formula is necessary, no special phraseology’, no set words. Clearly condemning the formalistic prayers taught by a professional clergy, Jesus counseled: “Do not say the same things over and over again, just as the ■people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words.” (Matt. 6:7) Acceptable prayer must be from the heart. As the inspired psalmist wrote: “I have called with my whole heart.”—Ps. 119:145.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> To be earnest and wholehearted in our prayers we must believe that God exists, that his power is unlimited, and that he is just and wise to grant us those requests that will be for our benefit. The apostle Paul laid down the rule: “He that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.&quot; (Heb. 11:6) Any element of doubt as to such matters introduces the possibility that the prayers of the doubter might not be heard.—Jas. 1:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>B</sup> One who earnestly approaches God in prayer may at times even be at a loss to express all that is in his heart. What then? Why, one can find strong assurance in tire words of Jesus: “God your Father knows what things you are needing before ever you ask him.” (Matt. 6:8) The fact that one goes to God reverently in prayer, and does so regularly, is proof that he recognizes his need for God and submits himself to God’s arrangement whereby true worshipers come to Him in prayer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> Never to be overlooked in prayer are our many trespasses against God’s will, in thought or in word or in deed, and for these we need to pray for forgiveness. The heavenly Father will forgive and forget provided that we honestly strive to correct our mistakes and also extend forgiveness to those who offend us.—Mark 11:25; 1 John 1:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> Thus, prayer that God will hear must be offered to him in the name of his Son, Christ Jesus, and must be in harmony with the principles set down in his Word, the Bible; it must be offered from the heart, and in evidence of this the petitioner’s course of action must harmonize with the prayer. How encouraging to know that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him&quot;! —Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Famine—1975!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■$&gt; That Is what the future holds for the world, according to a book recently written by William and Paul Paddock. In commenting on its forceful contents, the Washington </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star</span><span class="font14"> of May 24, 1967, remarks: “[They] are not talking about a famine that can happen if we all don't take certain measures. They’re talking about a famine that will happen no matter what anyone does.&quot; It is not something that can be avoided by modern Ingenuity and the generosity of a wealthy nation: but, as the article points out, these may well be factors that have contributed to the failure of leaders to find sound solutions. So, according to their estimate of the situation, by 1975 the world will be in the grips of hopeless famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Riots Sweep U.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">4' The worst riots In American history swept through the country in July. City after city experienced rampaging mobs that looted stores and threw fire bombs. The loss in cash and property was close to one thousand million dollars. Sniping contributed to a rising death toll. The situation became so bad in Detroit that Federal troops had to be called to help the police and the National Guard. Tanks roamed the streets exchanging fiftycaliber machine-gun fire with the snipers. In four days of rioting, property damage exceeded $200 million, fires totaled 2,665, injuries exceeded 1,000 and the death toll climbed to 39 at the time of this report, making Detroit's riot the worst ever experienced by an American city. Rioting also erupted in other Michigan cities such as Saginaw, Grand Rapids, Pontiac and Flint. It has turned more than eighty cities across the country into battlegrounds thus far this year. Not even the nation's capital city of Washington has escaped. As the Bible foretold, lawlessness has increased.—Matt. 24:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Desalting Plant Opened</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Key West. Florida, has become the first city in the United States to get its fresh water from the sea. The desalting plant produces 2.62 million gallons of fresh water every day from seawater, providing Key We=t with its own freshwater supply for the first time in its history. Until now water was piped to it through a 130-mile-long pipeline that has been frequently broken by hurricanes. Fresh water produced by the plant costs eighty-five cents for 1,000 gallons, or ten cents more than what the city has been paying. Heated seawater is passed under pressure through fifty chambers with progressively lower atmospheric pressure. In each chamber some of the water vaporizes as steam, which is condensed and drawn off as fresh water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Sex in Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;i</span><span class="font14"> Tlie changing altitude of the British toward sex was expressed by the Marquess of Salisbury when she said recently: “Practices that a few years ago could hardly have been mentioned at all in decent society are now taken as a matter of course.&quot; Indicating this change in view was the passing by the House of Commons of a bill legalizing homosexuality in private between consenting adults. It is also seen in the fact that Britain has between 100,000 and 200,000 illegal abortions and 60,000 illegitimate births a year, a doubling of such births in ten years. As might be expected with lowering moral standards, divorce petitions have risen 50 percent in five years. The moral tone of the nation would be far better if there were more respect for the high moral standards of God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Fire on Aircraft Carrier</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;• An accidental fire on the aircraft carrier Forrestal has resulted in the worst calamity to strike a United States Navy ship since World War II. The fire set off bombs that badly damaged the stern of the vessel. At the time of this report there were 129 persons known to have been killed by the fire. Of the 80 planes carried by the ship, 42 were damaged and 21 were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Closer Ties</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">♦ Agreement to recognize each other's baptism is the latest effort at church unity in the Netherlands. The Roman Catholic Church and Dutch Reformed Church represent the major part of the population in the Netherlands. Both have accepted the procedure of causing wat- r to fall upon the subject for baptism while an official of the church recites ihe formula: “in the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Ghost.&quot; Although this procedure is accepted by these churches, it is not the Scrip-turally established method of baptizing a person, which is complete immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope in Istanbul</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When Pope Paul stepped into the Eastern Orthodox Cathedral of St. George in Istanbul, Turkey, it was the first time in history that a Roman Catholic pope had entered an Eastern Orthodox church. There he spoke with eighty-one-year-old Athenag-oras, patriarch of the Eastern Church, about ecumenical unity. The two churches had been united until 1054 C.E., when Pope Leo IX excommuni rated the • ntire Eastern Church, making a final separation into the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church In recent years the two churches have been exploring the possibility of a reunion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Earthquakes in Turkey</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the night of July 22 an earthquake shook Turkey, bringing destruction to at least 1,000 homes and damaging hundreds more in the area where it centered, which was about a hundred miles east of Istanbul. Thus far 86 bodies have been recovered. Yet this was not as damaging as the quake that shook Turkey' last year and took 2,500 lives. Later, on July 27, another quake tucked the mountainous eastern provinces of Erzincan and Tunceli, causing an esti mated 100 deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Eating Starch and Clay</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">♦ Some New York doctors have found that persons who eat clay or starch cause their bodies to have an iron-deficiency anemia. This seems to be a practice that is not uncommon among some women, particularly during pregnancy. The doctors attributed the practice to folklore about presumed benefits during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Danger to Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■i&gt;&gt; Unguarded roofs and open windows in cities are a constant danger to children during the summer months. In New York city, from June 1 to July 11 there were twenty-two children killed by falling from windows, fire escapes and roofs. Parents living in apartments can safeguard their children by opening windows only from the top or by attaching safety devices such as bars in front of the open windows. It is easy for young children to crawl to a windowsill when there are beds, chairs or cribs near a window. Permitting children to climb, play or sleep on fire escapes or on the root is exceedingly unwise. They laiK the maturity to exercise the caution needed on such dangerous places. A little forethought on the part of parents can safeguard the lives of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Drunk Elephants</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">♦ Once a year the elephants of Kruger National Park in South Africa become dangerously drunk. They eat the plumlike iruit of the marula tree, which they relish, and then drink great quantities of water. The fruit ferments in their stomachs and forms alcohol, causing some of the elephants to become uncontrollably drunk. About thirty have to be shot by rangers every year because they become too mean while under rhe influence of alcohol. Tests of their blood show a very high alcoholic content. Although most of them stagger to a place where they can sleep off their intoxication, they go back to the marula trees for more fruit and another drunken spree. Like some humans. they do not seem to know when they ha-e had enough</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Canal-opening Manatees</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; Preventing weeds from clogging important canal networks in central and southern Florida has been a major problem that is now being solved by manatees, more commonly known as sea cows. In one day a manatee can eat 100 pounds of underwalei plants. Within a week it can dear the weeds from a hall mile of waterway. Weighing from 350 pounds to one ton, a manatee might have difficulty maneuvering in small secondary canals, but in the main canals their prodigious appetite might solve Florida's problem of weed-choked canals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rat Damage</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; It has been estimated that Americans may suffer as many as 14,000 rat bites a yeai Infants have died as a result of such bites. Rats are the carriers of such serious diseases as the plague and typhus fever. The damage they do to food and clothing is estimated at one thousand million dollars a year in the United States alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Quakes in Venezuela</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;i&gt; On the night of July 29, three earthquakes rocked Caracas, Venezuela, killing 47. The known death toll may rise considerably as the debris ot collapsed buildings is dug away. Two apartment houses containing forty or fifty families crumbled into heaps ol broken masonry. One was a ten-story building the floors of which collapsed on one another like a house of cards. Walls of other buildings collapsed into the streets, leaving entire apartments exposed. Five apartment buildings were shaken apart, one being sixteen stories high. Destructive earthquakes were foretold in the Bible as one of the many distressing things that would mark the last days of this old system </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font14"> things.—Matt. 24:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Navigational Stone</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;£&gt; One of the means used by the Vikings for navigating on the open seas was a sun stone. This stone enabled them to locate the sun in all kinds of weather and so they were able to chart their course. What these stones were was unknown until recently when Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ram-skou discovered that the transparent crystal c 'led cordierite turns from yellow to dark blue when turned so that its molecular alignment is at right angles to ti - plane of polarized light from the sun. Apparently the Vikings could locate the sun by rotating this crystal until it turned blue. In an experiment, Ramskou found that it was accurate to within </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">2 12 </span><span class="font14">degrees of die nue position of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking and Dead Babies</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A comparison of 617 stillbirths with 16,377 live births in Britain revealed that pregnant women who smoke moderately are 20.8 percent likely to bear dead babies than the average mother. Do you smoke?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Cigarette Warnings</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; By the first of July the requirement in the United States that cigarette packs carry the warning label &quot;Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health&quot; had been in effect for ; year and a half. The E ederal Trade Commission reported to Congress, however, that this had influenced practically nobody to stop smoking. The trade commission also noted that rhe cigarette industry' has failed to live up to its own advertising code. Much of its advertising is still aimed at young people, the commission said. The commission urged that all cigarette advertising include a health warning, and proposed that the cigarette warning label be made stronger, to read: “Warning: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from c. ncer and other diseases.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Many men feel that justice for all is an idealistic and wishful dream, one that will never come true. Why? Because they have experienced bitter disappointments; they have witnessed injustice and been the victims of it themselves.</span></p>

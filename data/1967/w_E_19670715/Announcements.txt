FIELD MINISTRY
Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus Christ said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) These words are as applicable today as when they were first spoken. Jehovah’s Christian witnesses know this and so they realize that, to be spiritually nourished, it is important not to neglect the house of the true God. Regularly each week their meetings build them up spiritually and equip them to witness to others about God. During July, as they apply this training, they will be sharing with others one of the fine Bible-study aids that they use in their own congregation meetings. They will offer to all persons the book Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God, with a booklet, for only 50c.
TO KEEP YOU INFORMED
No generation in history has been as well informed as ours. The mass media of radio, television and the printed page, as well as specialized schools and employment training programs, are better equipping men for life and better acquainting them with the rapidly changing pattern of events that characterizes this generation. Yet where in all this vast area of education can we learn the outcome of this world’s affairs? Only in the Bible is such education to be found, and Awake! regularly transmits this instruction for life by keeping you informed on those issues that are helping to shape the destiny of this world. Read Awake! regularly. One year for only $1.

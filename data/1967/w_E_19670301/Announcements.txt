FIELD MINISTRY
In order for people to put faith in Jehovah God and his provision for salvation through Christ they need to hear the Bible’s message and have opportunity to get their questions answered. During March, if one of Jehovah’s witnesses calls at your home, it will be with the desire to help you personally to get satisfying Bible answers to your questions. He will gladly take time to show you the answers in your own Bible. As a further aid, he will encourage you to subscribe for this fine Bible journal, The Watchtower, for a year, for just $1.
DOES THE TRUTH REALLY “HURT”?
There is an old saying: “The truth hurts.” But it really does not hurt nearly so much as ignoring it or misrepresenting it does. Proof can be found in the bad results of exaggerated advertising, misleading political promises and deceptive international relationships. How refreshing it is, then, to encounter truth in a form that can affect your future for good. That is what you find in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Are you availing yourself regularly of the benefits to be had from their dedication to this outstanding virtue? You can be! Receive both magazines for one year for only $2. Send now and receive free six timely booklets on Bible subjects.

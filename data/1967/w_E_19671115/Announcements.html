<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ are builders. They build up Christian personalities on the right foundation of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:11-46:3:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:11-13</a>) They know that among the problems that hinder some from being built into Christian personalities is failure to understand why God has permitted wickedness. Some persons, stumbling over this issue, have become easy prey for such teachings as evolution. These persons need help, and Jehovah’s witnesses have the means to help them​—a recently released, delightfully illustrated book that discusses both evolution and God’s permission of wickedness. This enlightening volume entitled “Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?” they are offering to all sincere seekers of truth during November, along with a booklet, for only 25c.</p>

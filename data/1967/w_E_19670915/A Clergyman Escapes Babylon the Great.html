<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In a town in Mexico, a Protestant clergyman, who had been a pastor there for ten years, obtained a copy of the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </em>from Jehovah’s witnesses. He confessed to the Witnesses that he did not know what to preach in church anymore. When shown the book, he was surprised at the way it taught the truth so clearly. A study was started and it was conducted twice a week for two months. This resulted in his resigning as pastor of the church there. In the third month he began visiting some of his former flock and telling them about the “good news.” Studies are being conducted with some of these same people.</p>

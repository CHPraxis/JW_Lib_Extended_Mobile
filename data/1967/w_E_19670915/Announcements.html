<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">thirty-second chapter of Isaiah</a> calls attention to God’s Kingdom rule as the means that will bring peace. Even now, as foretold in that chapter, peace exists among the Christian congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. They are desirous of preserving their possession of Christian peace and inviting others to share it with them. To extend this invitation to others, during September Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering in their house-to-house ministry the fine Bible-study books <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God </em>and <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </em>either one, along with a booklet, for 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>NEW AND REVISED</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A revised edition of the fine book <em>Qualified to Be Ministers </em>was released this summer at the “Disciple-making” District Assemblies and is now available for general distribution. It contains all the enlightening material of the original edition as to speech preparation and delivery, how to study, meetings of the congregation and ministerial and congregational activity. Now, in addition, it contains material on Progressive Speech Training for use in the congregation Theocratic Ministry Schools. Do you have your copy? Send today. Only 50c</p>

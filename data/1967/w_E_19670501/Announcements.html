<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Zealous activity marked the life of Jesus’ disciples. They joyfully accepted the responsibility of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. That is the way it is with Jesus’ modern-day disciples, Jehovah’s witnesses. They are joyfully busy in preaching, but keep this work in balance with other Christian responsibilities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:13</a>, 1950 Ed.) During May part of their work will consist of calling on people from door to door to talk about God’s kingdom and to offer them the excellent Bible-study books <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God </em>and <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </em>either one for 50c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Life is our most prized possession. Yet how many persons today are really free to enjoy it?​—free from sickness, anxiety, various forms of oppression, free from fear of the future? The Bible has been called the Book of Life. It could also be called the Book of Freedom because it holds out concrete hope for mankind of our own generation to enjoy life everlasting​—in freedom. To learn how this hope is to be realized and what your part in it is, read the 416-page, hardbound book <em>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </em>Sent postpaid for only 50c.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of Isaiah’s prophecy that said: “Make the heart of this people unreceptive, and make their very ears unresponsive, and paste their very eyes together, that they may not see with their eyes and with their ears they may not hear”?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just as Isaiah’s preaching proved to “this people” that they did not want healing or understanding, that they were too selfish to understand and learn from even a good teacher, so today Kingdom preaching proves that people have shut their own eyes and ears and that they will selfishly refuse to understand till calamity comes.​—Pp. 17-19.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● What did Jesus mean when he said: “But many that are first will be last and the last first”?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus’ disciples, who were the last ones that the self-righteous Jewish religious leaders thought would gain a throne in God’s kingdom, became first by gaining that foremost position; in the reversal of matters those who had been “first” among the Jews became the “last” ones to accept the “penny,” most rejecting it and thereby losing out on Kingdom privileges.​—Pp. 42, 43, 50.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● In Jesus’ illustration of the penny, what was symbolized by the penny?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The privilege and honor of being a member of spiritual Israel and of serving as spirit-anointed ambassadors of God’s Messianic kingdom.​—Pp. 49, 56.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● How can it be said that all of Jehovah’s witnesses are full-time ministers?</strong></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● What are the daughters of Babylon the Great?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The various religious sects, both in Christendom and in pagandom, that copy their mother in committing fornication with the kings of the earth. All being of the same Babylonish family, they make up the world empire of false religion.​—P. 91.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The “faithful and discreet slave” organization of true, devoted, anointed Christians.​—P. 106.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>● Why did Samson pray for strength to bring vengeance upon the Philistines for the loss of only one of his two eyes?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Samson apparently charged the loss of one of his eyes to his own lack of wakefulness in the affair with Delilah, but the loss of the other eye he charged to the Philistines.​—P. 117.</p>

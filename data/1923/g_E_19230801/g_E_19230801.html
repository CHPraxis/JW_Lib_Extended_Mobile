<p><span class="font8">China and Her People—In Four Parts </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Part One)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font5">HINA may be said to be the land of exploitation. “She has grown for centuries from a vigorous youth to an overlarge, sluggish nation with untold wealth lying at her feet, lacking ambition and energy to grasp what is within reach. And with stoical perseverance she stands idly by and watches the daring and avaricious White man come in and bag her resources, enslave her people, and make way with tin; spoils. But it is time for China to wake up; and wake she must.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In tracing the peoples of earth it is not necessary to go farther back than the Flood, which was almost 4,400 years ago. The race thereafter sprang from three heads: Japheth, the progenitor of the Whites, who went west and north, and settled throughout Europe; Ham, the forefather of the Blacks, who went south and west, settling in Africa; Shorn, the ancestor of the Hebrews, who was undoubtedly the head of the eastern and northern races of Asia. It is not likely that racial distinctions were as great then as now; that in the beginning there was much intermarrying is also probable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a tradition among the Chinese that the first man was Shum, who can easily be identified with the Bible Shorn. It is believed that the peaceful king who subdued Egypt and built the Great Pyramid about 4,100 years ago was Melchizedek, who was none other than Shorn. Leaving Egypt as peacefully as lie entered it, he moved his band north and east through Babylonia and Assyria, settling in Asia. Now and then families or bands would ’drop out and form roving settlements, generally pushing eastward. From Shorn sprang tlio Tartars, Mongolians, Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Eskimos, American Indians, and the lAatecs of Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">China was called the “Celestial Empire” be</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cause </span><span class="font5">her first emperors were “heavenly” dei</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ties, </span><span class="font5">or descended from some deified personage, as is the traditional origin of rulers with most heathen nations. Also, China has been known as the “'Flowery Kingdom,” not because she has so many varieties of wild and tame flowers, but because she is “the flower of kingdoms.” Having been shorn of so much glory, she is now struggling to learn to walk as a republic. With a great future before the Chinese people, the next few years are sure to be filled with more or less perplexity and agitation; and it would not surprise us if, in the remaking and remodeling of the nations in the ushering in of the Golden Age, China would take a most important position.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Distribution of Population</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font5">HINA is a vast territory; counting Manchuria, Mongolia, Turkestan, Tibet and China proper, it covers an area of 4,300,000 square miles, an area considerably larger than either Europe or the United States. In latitude, Harbin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">corresponds with</span><span class="font5"> Minneapolis, Peking with Philadelphia, Shanghai with Mobile, and Canton with Havana, Cuba. The population is estimated at 350,000,000 to 425,000,000. The most conservative estimate of the distribution is as follows: Manchuria 18,000,000; Mongolia 3,000,000; Turkestan 3,000,000; Tibet 3,000,000; China 323,000,000. Six-sevenths of her population live in one-third of her area, the southeasterly section, and are fairly well served with waterways. China has a coast line of some 2,000 miles; the mainland is made up of a series of parallel river plains running into the Pacific ocean. At the head waters of these rivers there are hills and mountains and vast wastes of unexplored country; the lower valleys are broad, </span><span class="font4">fertile, </span><span class="font5">and thickly populated. Into these the White man has pushed his way. China’s great cities are built along the rivers and harbors. The greatest canal in the world is built 100 miles inland, connecting the sHoang-Ho and</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Yangtse rivers, and is 1,000 miles in length. No nation in the world is better watered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Like the United States, China has a great Northwest. This Northwest is beckoning for a man; eventually it will find its J. J. Hill. The ^railroads will pierce this vast territory, and give the young men there a chance to go west and grow up with the country. Our “wild and woolly West” is therefore not the only one. Wild animals, wild birds, wolves, antelope, etc., </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">numerous. Mongolia is a dark and gruesome place; an explorer some time ago brought from there over 2,500 zoological specimens. As the Mongols never bury their dead, it is not uncommon to see thousands of bands of semiwild dogs devouring the human dead. Tt is unsafe to go anywhere unarmed, and to venture </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font5">at night is suicidal; for unlike the cat, you’ll never come back! The toughness and gaineness of the wild ass in Mongolia is described in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fact </span><span class="font5">that a handsome specimen was run down, going over thirty-five miles and at times at a burst of speed of forty-five miles an hour. After being caught, he was rubbed down, washed, photographed, and turned loose.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Devastation of Streams</span></h4>
<div><img src="g_E_19230801_files/g_E_19230801-3.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AVOC </span><span class="font5">is sometimes played by the streams </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of China. </span><span class="font5">Defective transportation facili</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ties and floods </span><span class="font5">destroy millions of Chinese. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Every few </span><span class="font5">years other millions perish in their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">river </span><span class="font5">floods. This is one of the reasons that China’s population does not increase. For the past fifty years her population has been estimated at near 400,000,000. But, notwithstanding, the great plain'of China continues to be the richest farming land in the world. It is interesting to know that the loess, or fine silt, which makes the fertile plain, and incidentally causes the floods by forcing the river to build itself above the land-level, comes by the airroute from the great desert of Gobi. It is this wind-blown desert that is at once China’s joy and China’s sorrow—the source of her food supply and the destruction of her population. This plain is a little larger than the semicircle of the Gulf States; yet it supports about one-half of China’s great population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">China has her “Isle of Patmos,” her place of exile. About 500 years ago three small families were driven into exile in a barren mountain pass, supposedly for being traitorous to China. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They were </span><span class="font5">supposed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">have died, being unable</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">VtOOKLYK, V. Xa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to find food. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But they found food and lived on, </span><span class="font5">increasing in numbers, until they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">now have </span><span class="font5">thirty medium-sized villages. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The quaintness of </span><span class="font5">the Chinese dress, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the manners and habits of </span><span class="font5">500 years ago are still preserved by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">these peo</span><span class="font5">ple of the “Hidden Valley.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Differences in the Yellow Race</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">S THERE are wide differences in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">White </span><span class="font5">peoples of earth, so we find in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Yellow.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">While Manchuria is not a part of China </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">proper, </span><span class="font5">it is much more intimately related to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">China </span><span class="font5">than Mongolia. There is as much difference between the Manchus and Chinese as between the Chinese and Japanese/ But Manchuria </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">Mongolia are no longer looked upon by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Chinese as dependencies, but as integral </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">parts </span><span class="font5">of the Chinese Republic; and there is a sensitive ambition to exercise national control </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font5">these two important regions. Japan dominates the economic development of Manchuria, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">due to </span><span class="font5">the control of the South Manchurian Railway. &quot;When Americans sell machinery and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">other </span><span class="font5">merchandise to Chinese in Manchuria there are delays, holdups, and mistakes made so that buying from others than Japanese becomes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font5">embarrassing. China is learning what it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">means </span><span class="font5">for outsiders to control her transportation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The-</span><span class="font5">twenty-five-year lease </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">this railway </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">expired </span><span class="font5">last </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">March, and China demanded that the road, </span><span class="font5">1,000 miles in length with its feeders, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be re</span><span class="font5">turned. But Japan flatly refused to heed the demand; for in 1915 the treaty, which has </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font5">come famous for its twenty-one points, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">extended </span><span class="font5">the control of the railway ninety-nine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font5">longer. This treaty was forced upon China, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">no doubt Japan will try to hold her unfair advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That China is awaking and trying to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">avoid </span><span class="font5">being imposed upon longer is evidenced by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">fact that early in the year the Chinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parlia</span><span class="font5">ment passed a resolution through both </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">houses </span><span class="font5">declaring that the treaties of 1915 were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">abro</span><span class="font5">gated. Before this, Wang Fu, a member </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">Washington delegation, resigned when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he saw </span><span class="font5">how China was being trampled </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">upon with ap</span><span class="font5">parently no means of redress. Alfred Sze, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">min</span><span class="font5">ister to the United States, who seemingly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sees </span><span class="font5">matters from the financier’s viewpoint, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">reported </span><span class="font5">that China was having a fair deal. Both </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">these gentlemen were candidates for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Minister </span><span class="font5">of Foreign Affairs in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Chinese Cabinet. Wang Fu was promptly chosen. Thus China</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">cate and complex; and the way the tangled skein is unraveled may depend upon the brand f and quality of gunpowder the Powers deliver on order, or upon the cunning of the politicians * in inciting banditry to harass and embarrass the government. The astute, oily character of diplomacy of the Powers, especially in view of the understanding which the Powers have had with Japan, will have much to do with the outcome. Some well-posted men say that Japan - has a spirit of conciliation toward China; that there is not liable to be grievous trouble; that Japan is even now retrenching in Manchuria and gradually relinquishing her hold, but seeks to retain her trade relations and keep out Western competition. But this statement may be and probably is the adroitness of diplomacy concealing the truth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Isolated for Centuries</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font5">ATHER than be in the limelight and pander to pride China has of her own choice been isolated, a hermit nation. Her geographical setting has contributed to this end. The Mongolian deserts formed a natural barrier on the north; the impassable Himalayas have been silent sentinels on the west; the sea and the oceans swept her southern and eastern boundaries. Thus hemmed in, she has developed a unique civilization which has seemed to the Chinese superior to that of other nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When nations came knocking at her doors China was annoyed, but not alarmed. The Portuguese came first in 1517; next came the Spaniards in 1575; the Dutch in 1622. But these touched only the fringe of the hermit giant. It remained for aggressive England to assume the right of breaking the shell of China, and in 1793 a party of Englishmen ventured in boats to Peking. English diplomacy failed then to establish an embassy, as was also the case in an effort made in 1816. What suavity could not do, gunpowder accomplished. The seizure of opium belonging to a British subject was the excuse England had for declaring war on a helpless, overgrown, dull youth; and of course the Lion was victorious. By the treaty of Nanking in 1842 Hongkong was ceded in perpetuity to Great Britain; and the ports of Canton, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo and Shanghai </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">opened to foreign trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">China was greatly concerned at the brazenness of the “barbarians/<sup>7</sup> Causes of friction multiplied, and a second war in 1858 conipelled China to open up the Yangtse to foreign trade. England kept plowing up the fallow grouftd and succeeded in her objective—the establishing of diplomatic relations with the Imperial Court, having the treaties so worded as to cause no ■ offense—in England. China from then on has been plundered, exploited, deceived, and robbed by the so-called “Christian<sup>77</sup> nations of the &lt;&nbsp;world. To her credit the JJnited States has ; refrained from the frantic grasping of spoils. Several times the Washington officials have endeavored to get treaties through which would preserve the integrity of China and save her from complete dissolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From the days of Lao-Tze China has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a ~ </span><span class="font5">highly civilized country in all that concerns art and literature, manners and government; in fact, China is too civilized to fight in dishonest warfare. As long as scheming politicians and militarists attack China from overhead and bigoted missionaries and avaricious merchants „J| from beneath, what show has she to recover her equipoise and become independent? Is there nothing to be preserved to her peoples because she is stupid in the art of war and careless in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">S. </span><span class="font5">the use of soap? Potentially she has been the most powerful nation of earth; her history antedates that of all other Gentile nations: and in point of numbers she could carry on a continuous civil warfare and still have enough sol-diers to make the world respect her. All she y needs is sanitary conditions to conserve the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yj</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">been an inventive race; for many things are credited to their skill, such as gunpowder, the * mariner's compass, printing, etc. But today they arc awaking from a long slumber; they must bestir themselves if only as a means of self-preservation.

<p><span class="font5">ehurchianity<sup>7</sup>, to accept at the point of bayonets all the opium that the cargoes of the world's “civilizer” nation could dump on her shores! Perhaps it was opium that put her to sleep. Since about 1906, when importation of this drug </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font5">China began to be stringently curtailed, the people have been arousing from their lethargy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">China has inexhaustible beds of porcelain </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">earth, </span><span class="font5">the basis of her industry in chinaware. Gold, silver, and copper are found there in limited quantities; coal in abundance, also mercury and iron. Sho abounds in seven hundred or more kinds of birds; two hundred species of mammals, including the tiger, leopard, bear, badger, elephant, and rhinoceros. The rivers teem with wild ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans. Fish are exceedingly plentiful, and the cormorant has been trained to catch fish. This is sometimes shown in movies: A ring is placed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">around </span><span class="font5">the neck of the cormorant so that it cannot swallow the fish; it dives from the prow of the boat, catches the fish with great skill, and brings them up in the pouch under </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">lower mandible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font5">goldfish are from China. The varieties of trees and shrubs are said to be wonderful; some are of great value, notably the tea plant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">the .mulberry tree. The silkworms feed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">upon the </span><span class="font5">latter. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">are indebted to China for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">many </span><span class="font5">varieties of flowers and vegetables. Some of our chickens are known as Asiatics- Chinese silk outlasts that from any other country<sup>7</sup>, through either a better way of feeding the worms or a greater dexterity in handling the silk in the weaving—possibly both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farms average one acre, and eighty-five percent of the people are agriculturists. In the north the principal crops are wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, and vegetables; in the south are rice, sweet potatoes, sugar, cotton, mulberries, and vegetables. The Chinese are not strictly a rice-eating people; for there are over 50,000,000 who eat no rice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Vast areas, rich in natural resources, await railroads and settlement for development. The Chinese are industrious; but not having an inordinate love of money they do not take to building railroads and other commercial enterprises whereby their money may work while they sleep. They practise intensive </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">farming. </span><span class="font5">When the hillsides are too steep to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cultivate -</span><span class="font5">they convert these into huge stairsteps, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">making </span><span class="font5">suitable for gardening </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">land possible. </span><span class="font5">Hence they get the largest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">yield per acre of </span><span class="font5">any fanners in the world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">principal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">indus^ </span><span class="font5">trial centers are Tientsin, north; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Shanghai, </span><span class="font5">center; Canton, south.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ILK production originated in China many </span><span class="font5">centuries ago, and for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">long time </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">remained </span><span class="font5">a secret with that country. Nevertheless </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">failure to readily adopt modern methods </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">production </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">manufacture has </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">caused the </span><span class="font5">Chinese silk industry<sup>7</sup> to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">surpassed by that </span><span class="font5">of other countries employing more </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">efficient </span><span class="font5">methods. Hongkong ranks first </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in the knitting </span><span class="font5">industry, the machinery of her mills </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">having </span><span class="font5">been imported from America. Owing to the increased demand for cement in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">construction </span><span class="font5">work, a company capitalized at $3,000,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">been formed to erect a cement plant at Shanghai. Another factory lias been established </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font5">Nantungchow to make lime from the shells </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">oysters and clams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 3918, the General Edison Company, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">find</span><span class="font5">ing freight rates extremely high to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Pacific </span><span class="font5">coast and the breakage something terrible, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font5">cided that they would try making their electric lamps, globes and bulbs in China, and do their shipping over the peaceful waters of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pacific </span><span class="font5">rather than over the railroads, with their rough <sup>: </sup>handling, in America. The bulbs made in China . last fifty percent longer than those made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">here, </span><span class="font5">and the cost of labor is $4.50 in America against sixteen cents in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The openings in China for American trade <sup>j </sup>are illustrated in the Foochow district, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">where </span><span class="font5">small-type machinery has been sold for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">manu-</span><span class="font5">factoring hosiery and cloth, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for hulling </span><span class="font5">and polishing rice, pumping, etc. Electrical machinery, electrical goods, small electric </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">light </span><span class="font5">plants^ dyes, paints and chemicals are in de- . maud; and there is a good market for cotton piece goods. One authority says that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">results of </span><span class="font5">the World War have been to make </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Europe and </span><span class="font5">America undesirable fields for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">captains </span><span class="font5">of industry; for returns are insecure, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and sub- J </span><span class="font5">ject to ever-increasing taxation. Thus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">China -</span><span class="font5">looms as a veritable El Dorado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some </span><span class="font5">expect that sooner </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or later American ;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">industries will be moved to China, and the procU </span><span class="font5">acts therefrom shipped back here to be sold in competition with American labor. In fact, this was the threat in 1921. This is the extent to which big business is prepared to go to reduce the workingman here to conditions bordering on peonage. The blame will be fastened on labor. Should this come to pass, we must not look upon it as a sordid scheme for profits, but as the highest form oE altruism known to man •—a sacrifice for the larger good, that ultimately the trade between the United States and China might be increased!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Trade-Unions Springing Up</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font5">ORMALLY, business in China is almost a social institution, and the important affairs are transacted at the dinner tabic rather than elsewhere. The merchant is a heavy buyer, respects his obligations, is guided by dictates of conscience rather than by law, is not accustomed to provide letter of credit with order, 'does his business over the teacup rather than the telephone and, ordinarily, is friendly to American people and things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is at the presemt time over a million and a half spindles, utilizing about 225,000 tons ■ of cotton yearly. If the rate of increase keeps up, and internal strife ceases, China could make enough cotton to supply the demands of the world. But American labor has nothing to fear on this score; for trade-unions are springing up, especially in the South, with remarkable suddenness and vigor, and also it is said that Bolshevism is making rapid headway among the more intellectual clashes. Keen competition to exploit the resources and wealth of China is manifested in the rivalry of some of the “Christian” nations. This has come about by the &quot;Open Door” policy, which throws the door open to the West, but not to the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some reports indicate the rising of an industrial system in China, the worst in the history </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the world; unbearable conditions are report</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font5">in the factories. Children, nine years of age </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">up, are employed by the tens of thousands, because their parents cannot afford their keep. Miners work ten hours a day, seven days in the week, and sometimes are flogged by overseers; and the pay is about eight cents a day. These low-paid workers are forming unions. Employes in iron foundries work from thirteen </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to eighteen hours a day, and the skilled among</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">them get about twelve cents a day. It is hardly to be wondered at that they strike, and demand ' shorter hours and increased pay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The railroads often employ girls and ^oung married women as ticket clerks and bookkeepers. Even the richer among the women, wno do ■ not necessarily have to work, are now taking ; up manual labor, such as light work in factories, making towels and socks, etc. They realize that employment brings health, more happiness and a measure of independence which they could not enjoy otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font5">ARLY in her history China made use of her abundant waterways, and these have served * well. The Chinese are building ships. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font5">Shanghai is a large shipyard operated by the s £ Government, but its engineering problems are superintended by Englishmen. The workman-ship is high grade, and a number of these ships are used by the American Government in Philippine waters. The waterways and rivers are ~ delightful, and houseboats are numerous; thesa <sup>3 </sup>a? e well provisioned, and a cook is always taken along. The oarsmen stand to propel and guide &lt;&nbsp;the houseboat. Life on the river is filled with peace, quietness and repose; and Mother Eartk supplies a scenic beauty of landscape that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font5">charming. Much freighting is done by water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chinese coolie comes in for his share, -In some places in the interior it is not uncom« mon to see much traffic on the roads; two- </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and' </span><span class="font5">three-mule carts, carrier coolies, mule litters, &quot;&nbsp;i ox trains, camel caravans, sedan-chairs and, 3 most of all, wheelbarrows. Sometimes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font5">may be two men at a barrow, and ofttimes the load weighs over 500 pounds—one man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at the </span><span class="font5">handles hanging the load from his shoulders and the other hitched in front pulling with a rope; and the roads for hundreds of miles may ~ * be rough enough to make travel for a horse t difficult. Imagine the sweating and fatigue </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ofl </span><span class="font5">body, the unhappiness of mind, and the aching void after feasting on a bowl of rice or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">maea- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'3</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Enormous Engine in China</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">AILROAD building is constantly going on in China, and roadways for automobiles. American coaches, engines and cars arc in demand. Not long ago the largest locomotive ever built was sent to China; it weighed over 300,000 pounds, and the engineer’s seat was ninety feet from the cowcatcher. The “good roads<sup>1</sup>' movement has opened up the market for autos with renewed vigor. About 4,000 cars are in Shanghai alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the largest orders placed by the Chinese Government for American locomotives was in 1921., when forty-two engines were contracted for at a cost of $2,000,000. Three hundred freight cars were ordered about the same time. Recently the Tientsin-Pukaw railway, the most important north and south trunk line, bought five complete American railway passenger trains of eleven cars each, including dining, parlor, and sleeping cars. Evidently investment in commercial and shipping activities for American capital is unlimited; for the Western ideas are that the development of the railroads there should reach the enormous sum of $5,000,000,-000—about three times what it now is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be that China will find it to her best interests not to encourage railroad building too much. If she should acquaint herself with the controlling powers operating our transportation systems and find what an uncontrollable and intricate piece of machinery it really is, perhaps she would see the advantage of going slowly and building her roads with her own capital, thereby enabling her to run the railways for the benefit of the people instead of for the enrichment of the investors. But maybe the automobiles and the flying machines will, from now on, check the growth of the railroad business. The Chinese are learning aviation. They have a school in Victoria, B. C., and ten made initial flights in February and did exceptionally well. When they have passed their examinations, they go to China and engage in commercial aviation there. This school is said to be the only one of its kind in North America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">factories, power houses, spinning, agriculture, commercial and fishing enterprises totaled 167; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and the aggregate increase in capital reached </span><span class="font5">over </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">$80,000,000. To keep these and other in</span><span class="font5">dustries going many young </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">people were pressed </span><span class="font5">into the labor ranks. Like other countries </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">lower classes of physical laborers, whose living is from hand to mouth, have been exploited </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">a long time by the landowners and capitalists* The uneducated and propertyless classes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mul</span><span class="font5">tiply and overproduce their kind as compared with their richer brethren. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The average family </span><span class="font5">in the north consists of from eight to nine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">chiL </span><span class="font5">dren; in the south, from five to six </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">children. </span><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font5">servant work is done almost entirely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">the maid servant employed by rich families* Servant employment agencies work their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nefa</span><span class="font5">rious game of extracting a fee from both </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ser</span><span class="font5">vant and employer, sometimes as much </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">twenty percent from the employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a coolie class among the women. Some are really slaves, and do not know it* They work in the fields; they help coal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">ships, and do other hard manual </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">labor. They </span><span class="font5">carry huge loads.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are men, women and children, the toilers, who are nearly forgotten when the upper crust fight for “privileged” rights which these never had. These toilers carry the burden ofi sustaining day by day the machines and mills </span><span class="font5">which marlf'the transition of China’s society into the realm of modern snobbery. But sometimes they are forgotten too long, then thud— conies a strike. This group has raised </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its voice </span><span class="font5">time after time the past year, and forced itself to the front,' compelling attention to its </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">real </span><span class="font5">rights and needs; and in some places its </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">power </span><span class="font5">commands deference. Most of these strikes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cen</span><span class="font5">tered around Shanghai, the most </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">prosperous </span><span class="font5">city in China. The high cost of living, one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the unavoidable chronic diseases necessarily rooted in the capitalistic system of production, jjitilessly gnaws at the proletariat, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">poor </span><span class="font5">wage-earning class. Prices go up, and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">life </span><span class="font5">of the laborer is sapped until </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he cries for </span><span class="font5">mercy.

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Work Done by Little Girls</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font5"> CLOSE-UP on the profiteer may be interesting. In the silk thread mills of China are employed 90,000 women and girls; one-third of the latter are children. They work thirteen hours a day, with one hour off at noon, seven days in the week; and during the rush season they are compelled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> work fourteen hours. The hardest work is done by little girls eight to nine years of age, who stand all day at basins of boiling water putting in cocoons and baling them out with dippers. Often they cannot get the cocoons in that way, and so the ' hands must be used to fish them out. Labor-saving devices in Italy are so constructed that it is not necessary to touch the boiling water; but not so in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past the apprentice at iron and steel workshops worked sixteen hours a day, and got nothing for it; he was poorly taught so that he would last longer—as an apprentice. Farm hands have been getting about live dollars and their keep a year. But labor conditions are rapidly changing for the better; the Chinese laborer is learning to strike. The monumental gall and rapacity of the employer will stand out in glaring and frightful colors shortly, after the reign of righteousness under Christ begins, when He shall bring the laborer into the proper light. Let the employer get the view now, by exchanging places for the moment, and ask himself how he would like to be treated if the tables were turned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Finances and the Public Debt</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HERE in all the world are the finances of a country in such a muddled condition as in China ? Her case is hopeless; for her leading men are not financiers, and it is not to be hoped that they could cope with the astute White man. The total indebtedness of China is over $2,000,-000,000 of which about $500,000,000 are without security; and at present she is in no condition to make payment. This worries not only the Chinese but the financiers and economic experts in foreign countries. These outsiders are watching the civil strife and trying to protect their interests. According to some, this debt is negligible when the resources are taken into consideration. This latter statement is designed to encourage the Chinese to go still further into 'debt by a billion or so, that the coffers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lenders may burst with the usury to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chinese Consortium (an organization </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">foreign banks) was formed to assist the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Chi</span><span class="font5">nese and to liberate them from poverty </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">loaning money for various purposes. Like </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Federal Reserve, it is a pieans by which finan-cialdom may tighten the fetters which bind, and wield the power which money always secures. The Consortium is a legalized international looting machine by which the Powers may jointly exploit China and drain away her resources. Last year the Consortium declared that China must put her house in order, establish a responsible government, stop civil warfare, demonstrate her power over the provinces, and prove that she can conduct herself in an orderly, businesslike manner, before she could borrow more money. When China has internal strife she may obtain no money; but when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">she </span><span class="font5">is good and obedient to her masters, the banking groups of America, England, France, and Japan are prepared to let her have the money to construct her enterprises, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">build her railroads, </span><span class="font5">etc.—at so much per centum.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>American Banks in China</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">rpiIIS Consortium, whose main business </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">to keep China docile, was endorsed by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Harding administration. It involves an international bankers’ pooling of funds and power to supply China with needed public utilities; as she lacks the money to absorb the overproduction of her friends—the people of the countries of the money lenders! A writer on this subject says: “If the American bankers who occupy the dominant position in this pool shall apply to China the spirit and methods by which they have exploited transportation in this country, we may be sure that the friendliness of China will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Qiot</span><span class="font5"> continue/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are three American and one Chinese-American bank organizations in China. And these banking institutions, together with the big Consortium, as we might expect, are not there doing business for their health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Consortium's American representatives meet in the office of the J. P. Morgan Company whenever there is any discussion of China’s financial problems. Always there is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">scheme </span><span class="font5">of the money lenders to bring about something which shall involve the victim nation in embarrassment, to draw her into debt; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and nothing has succeeded so well as war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">China shows imbecility were it not for the fact that she would rather be abused than take </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">arms. Iler people cannot help seeing that they are being imposed upon, but they are submissive and suffer it. This is really a commendable trait, and in the end will work out for the good and glory of China. Some sweet day, not so very far off, justice will dominate the affairs of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sub>;</sub> The principal revenue-producing agencies of ; the Chinese government arc the maritime customs and the &quot;salt gabclle,” as the salt revenue administration is popularly designated. These </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">largely supervised by foreign officers employed by the government, and the yield is about $100,000,000 a year. The direct import and export trade is almost entirely in the hands of non-Chincse 'merchants; ships trading in China ports are largely of foreign registry. How would </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font5"> like to have your business supervised by men of a different race I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon the formation of the first international Consortium in 1913 a loan of $125,000,000 was forced upon the Peking authorities to reorganize the finances of the newly-established republican government. As security, the annual receipts from the tax on salt ($80,000,000) was accepted. The contract between the Chinese government and the loaning group, consisting </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">British, French, German, Russian, and Japanese banks, provided that the system of collecting the tax on salt should be modernized (something the Chinese can hardly understand) with the assistance of foreign advisers. Production, transportation and sale of salt in China are strictly limited by treaty with the foreign Powers to natives of China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Robbing Done “Legally”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE salt belongs to China; it is sold to her own people; a tax is put upon it to appease </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">wrath of the foreign Powers; the revenues are handled by agents of the foreign banking interests to insure payment; and no human being knows how big a steal the salt business </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">China really is. And as foreign officers handle the revenue derived from maritime customs it is hardly to be wondered at that China is financially embarrassed. China is systematically being driven to the poorhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The international bankers who have taken an</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">interest in the affairs of China express </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">grave </span><span class="font5">V concern about the. financial future of that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">coun</span><span class="font5">try. A crisis is near at hand; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and the Chinese ' </span><span class="font5">bankers being hard pressed for funds are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">try-&quot; </span><span class="font5">ing to borrow from their friends in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">America </span><span class="font5">and England; but banks which advanced </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cred</span><span class="font5">its on Chinese collateral are becoming </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">restive </span><span class="font5">and in many cases business relations have been broken off. The trouble is, the financiers are a beginning to see that there is no real govern- j ment in China, that rival factions continue </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">wage war for personal enrichment; and they &lt;&nbsp;are afraid there will be a division of the spoils.. ■ with themselves left in the lurch. A recent J London advice says in effect: That for years | all the foreign capital loaned to China has been j utilized for munitions or corruption, and that such bonds as are secured on the Chinese Cus- * toms receipts can no longer be regarded as safe/ J for even the British Navy cannot compel people j to import goods they cannot pay for; therefore g all holding Chinese securities of all kinds should ] sell them for what they will bring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes we hear that China's greatest peril is Japan. The greatest peril of China is : the professional Chinese politician who, having learned the Western tricks, plays into </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">hands of the Japanese and is willing to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sell <sup>: </sup></span><span class="font5">China’s independence, resources, labor, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and <sup>: </sup></span><span class="font5">everything to Japan or anybody else, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">if he can . <sup>; </sup></span><span class="font5">thereby line his own pockets with gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Interesting Items of Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font5">EARLY all Chinese cities are electrically</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lighted; the better class have their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">elec- ; trie </span><span class="font5">irons and washing machines. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">rivalry between some of the towns </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mat- ' </span><span class="font5">ter of electric light plants. Each tries to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">outdo </span><span class="font5">J the other; and if a town in an obscure district gets an electric plant the neighboring towns im- J mediately put up a better one. Nantungchow prides itself on being the “model city of China”; &nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">besides electric lights it has over a hundred ’ miles of hard-surfaced roads, 300 primary j schools and over 20,000 students. The city proper has 150,000 population and the district S over 1,500,000. It is a great cotton center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the cities are built within high and -&gt; strong walls, which apparently go through and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;1 </span><span class="font5">over every obstacle. Tn the construction ofl these walls great stones are often used which &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lie </span><span class="font5">along the paths </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of farm gardens, being geo* :&lt; metrically laid out, and presenting in many in* * .j|</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stances</span><span class="font5"> really scenic and architectural beauty. In nearly every city, fine old Chinese homes and slums seem to be mixed promiscuously. A strange custom is to have one’s home in one part of the city, and his tea house and labyrinthine gardens quite remote from his residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shanghai, strictly speaking, is not a Chinese city; it is the melting pot of the Orient. It is not much unlike a large city in the United States; for all the modern conveniences are to be found there. It has about 700,000 population. English is taught in the schools, and some of the brands of &quot;Christianity” are said to flourish there. The East and the West, barbarian and sinner, rub elbows in Shanghai. Along the water front it is not unlike other ports; there are Japanese, Chinese, American, British, French, and Filipino business sections. Over the city fly the flags of many nations. Six- and seven-story buildings mark the prosperity, and * are indicative of the possibilities of the future. Nanking Road, the Mecca of the tourist, has its American, European, and Chinese shops in rows; and the climax is reached when the traveler comes to the two department stores where the goods of the East and the West mingle indiscriminately, as do their customers. Through the streets the British tram-car clangs along, rickshas scurry, motorcars wend their way, and horses with human freight dodge here and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shanghai has its games, gardens and sports, movies and playhouses, gambling and other dens. It is said that because the streets are crooked we are not to conclude that they follow the proverbial cowpaths as in America; but because the evil spirits of China travel in straight lines, the streets are constructed in such a way as to avoid them. Likewise the entrances of some of the houses are zigzag—to fool the spirits and cause them to strike their heads on some obstruction. Native guides throng the entrances of the city and insist on directing the visitors, expecting to have their &quot;mitts” greased liberally. The streets are so narrow in places that it is impossible for the sun to peep in; but the populace jostles its merry and gruesome way. A juggler entertains in the courtyard; a hawker sells whirligigs; the jovial beggar gets his handout; a Buddhist . priest chants and burns incense; and paintedfaced damsels sing in the restaurants. &quot;Shanghaied” in China means the same as &quot;Buffaloed.”</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font5">PEKING is not a rice-eating city; it is</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark54"><span class="font5">famous for its wheat bread and noodles,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark55"><span class="font5">its duck, and many succulent green vegetables unknown to us. Peking is supposed to be the capital of China; its district has a population</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">of about 1,000,000; of these but 1,000 are Americans. Foreigners are not permitted there with--out passports; for this reason it is called the &quot;Forbidden City.” The streets are a continuous carnival. The house fronts are gay with lac- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark56"><span class="font5">quer and a medley of signs and banners. The</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark57"><span class="font5">cries of peddlers fill the air. Barbers do a thriving business, equipped with stool and char- ‘ coal burner. Street sprinklers do their work</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark58"><span class="font5">with a bucket and long-handled wicker scoop.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark59"><span class="font5">Food venders balance a complete restaurant on</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark62"><span class="font5">heads; and all giggle and chat on meeting an</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark63"><span class="font5">acquaintance. To a Westerner everything seen is curious and amusing. The funerals resemble</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark64"><span class="font5">gorgeous circus parades. There is no social code on the streets—-simple manners, courteous recognition, and suave hospitality everywhere.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Childhood personality is respected, and unac- fl coinpanied children in the parks are in no danger.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark65"><span class="font5">The walls of the “Tartar City,” North Peking, with its palaces, temples, pagodas, and</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark66"><span class="font5">bridges are most beautiful. They can hardly be said to be a protection in time of war, but</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark67"><span class="font5">sometimes they protect life in civil strife. There is room for promenade on the south wall. The gate towers, crowned with their gorgeous tiles,</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Y </span><span class="font5">THE time this, is published we shall probably know whether or not Captain Roald Amundsen has started on his projected airplane flight from Point Barrow, Alaska, via the North Pole to Spitzbergen, 2,800 miles. If successful, we may even know of his success. The flight will be over seas and ice-fields without any prominent points by which the route may be fixed. [After making his test flight, his expedition was abandoned.] Unless the sun is visible all the way the flight must be by compass, in a region in which the compass changes very heavily. In case of contrary winds there are great dangers of missing the North Pole and Spitzbergen. Constant sunshine, no fogs or clouds, no winds and perfect machinery may grant success; the chances are against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Flying 1,400 miles between Houston, Texas, and Mt. Clemens, Michigan, in eleven and one-half hours, Lieutenant H. G. Crocker in the latter part of May made his way through twenty-nine separate and distinct rainstorms. For an hour of this time he was above dense clouds, flying by compass, until finally he found a rift through which he could pass to the under side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Professor Raimond Nimfuhr of Austria is said to have perfected a stabilizer for airplanes, likened to the antennae of insects, which automatically corrects errors of pilots, #so that the machine remains in steady flight regardless of the disturbances encountered. The device is said to make an airplane practically fool-proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every quarter of the world the big nations and the little ones are buying airplanes and training airmen. Siam has 300 trained pilots. All the South American countries are prepared to do battle in the air if they should go to war tomorrow. Russia has bought large numbers of Italian and German airplanes and is known to have many German pilots and instructors. The Allies have done everything in their power to throw Germany and Russia into each other’s arms and seem to have succeeded fairly well. Airplane service has been established between Berlin and London. The trip takes six and one-half hours and the rate of fare is about the same as first-class railroad and steamship fare. The Germans, who were admitted to have been the masters of the air along the western front during the World War, are not permitted to have airplanes suitable for military purposes, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have made great improvements in light</span><span class="font5">weight and commercial planes. Perhaps </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font5">are intending to do their military aviation with machines ostensibly owned in Russia.</span></p>

It is cutting deep into the ice-fields of the Arctic, Avith the result that the North Atlantic has had more dangerous ice-floes and huge icebergs than in any other season for many years.

One huge iceberg, extending over 120 feet out of water, was found one hundred miles further south than icebergs are usually found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Panama Canal is a huge success. Within the past year the number of vessels passing through the canal has increased from about 220 per month to about 400 per month, and the canal tolls are considerably over a million dollars per month.

<p><span class="font5">The mail-order houses have grown to immense proportions, but they have largely pursued a policy that will Avork for their downfall. In the effort to increase profits qualities have been sacrificed, goods have been made light weight and of skimped dimensions. Three or four inches off the length of a blanket, two inches off the width, two inches off the length of women’s stockings, excess of juice in canned goods, etc., make cheaper goods seem cheap until they are compared with standard quality goods, when discontent is sure to arise.

He gets the help, at twenty percent interest, by the time all the charges are paid; and the bank gets a rakeoff. This is one of the ways of getting rich and staying rich at the expense of workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many bankers whose fortunes have been built up by this crooked bonus system, by foreclosures of mortgages on the thinnest of excuses and by stock gifts for favoring this or that concern. In other words, there are many bankers who have used the money of the people in fighting the people and fighting for themselves. Occasionally one hears of an exception, a banker who is really honest and who tries to help his fellow men; but the banking business does not promote honesty. The reason for this is that the basis upon which it rests, interest, is in itself inherently wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the effort to put Central Europe on its feet, a loan of $25,000,000 is being made by some of the largest New York banks, the Steel Trust, the Standard Oil Company, and the General Electric Company. It is not believed that Austria can possibly pay the eight percent which these bonds carry. Very evidently this is the beginning of a scheme to compel the American people to finance Europe whether they wish to do so or not. The big business interests get in first; then the politicians drag the Government in; then the press advertises the arrangement; then the preachers sanctify it; and then the people pay the bill, all of it, including the original loan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The International Bankers have made all necessary arrangements to give Mexico a thorough cleaning. Among the things that the Mexicans must part with are the entire proceeds of the oil export tax, ten percent of the gross revenue of the railways of the country, and the entire net revenue of the railways; and they must turn the railways over to a group of the bankers. The Mexicans will be allowed to retain their eye-teeth and the hair on their heads. Meantime the recognition of the Mexican Government by our Government is delayed until the final papers are signed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT </span><span class="font5">the next World War, when it comes, will find France on one side of the problem and Gemfany and Russia on the other is a foregone conclusion. France is depending upon officers, airplanes, and cannon. It cannot depend upon men; it has been bled white. Germany has officers, it knows how to make airplanes and cannon; and Russia has plenty of men. But millions of men can be destroyed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">short time by the new methods of warfare that will be used—airplanes and poison gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every newspaper one picks up has something more to say of the efforts that France is making to force the German people to desperation. Some months ago the French seized the Krupp works, which for the past three years have been engaged in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, locomotives, automobiles, bridges, turbine engines, watches, clocks, instruments, and a thousand and one other things that men need a million times, more than they need the guns formerly made there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the French seized the plant, they undertook to steal all the automobiles about the place; and the workmen struck. The soldiers who had seized the plant turned a machine gun upon the workers, killing fifteen of them, and sent the directors of the works to prison for fifteen years for causing the strike. The natural effect of this throughout Germany is to make the Germans hate the French and to hasten the day of reprisals. The French seem bent on trying to force the Germans into Bolshevism, possibly so that they may have an excuse for sowing the country with poison gas and wiping out the whole German race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The German government has tried in every possible way to make the Allies understand that she is unable to pay the amounts of reparation demanded, and has asked again and again that the question as to whether or not she can pay what is asked be referred to an arbitration court of disinterested parties. The Allies always refuse this; and Communism gradually spreads among a people that find themselves confronted by conditions which they believe they cannot meet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bonar Law, who is too ill to continue to fill that post, is said to be due largely to his ability to produce whenever the occasion arises facts and figures, especially figures, which are convincing even to opponents. His popularity as a leader in the House of Commons was enhanced by the prompt way in which he arranged for the payment of the British debt to America, as well as by his general efficiency as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Taxes have been reduced, and a surplus is available justifying further reductions. The new government is less severe toward Russia than the retiring one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Workers in New Zealand are voicing objections to further immigration at this time, claiming that most industries are oversupplied with labor in some of the cities, that only rarely is the supply inadequate, and that the housing situation is such that overcrowding is unavoidable.

<p><span class="font5">Peace has been finally arranged between Turkey and Greece, after negotiations which have taken all winter. When the situation seemed almost hopeless the American minister at Switzerland, Mr. Joseph C.

Greece claims that she was egged into the war by Powers which subsequently made treaties with Turkey and left Greece unprotected. Evidently Great Britain is the one she has in mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Italy continues its mad ride under the direction of the Roman Catholic anarchist Mussolini as Prime Minister. One of his characteristic utterances is that men nowadays are tired of liberty. He makes this an excuse for his overthrow of the Italian government by force, and adds: “Liberty is no longer a chaste, severe maiden for whom generations in the first half of the last century fought and died. For the intrepid, restless youths who are now in the dawn of a new history, other words exercise a ^greater fascination; namely, order, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hierarchy, </span><span class="font5">and discipline.”</span></p>

In England women may vote if over thirty years of age, and in Belgium on certain conditions. Delegates from twenty-one countries took part in the conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The national executive committee of the Socialist party in America has announced that it will start a campaign which has for its object the retirement of Chief Justice Taft from the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, on the ground that it is contrary to public interest for one to occupy that position who is a beneficiary of the Steel Trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On May 22nd the Socialist Party of America 'demanded nationalization of the coal mines of the country; and on May 26th the American Bankers’ Association, which is in favor of stealing only when it is done on a large scale, agreed that forthwith school teachers, librarians, and bank officials should be enlisted “to combat the radical and subversive movements being urged in some parts of the world [Russia?] with unusual vehemence.” Manifestly the hearts of the financiers are failing them for fear at the things which they see coming upon society.</span></p>

A list of five-to-four decisions of the Supreme Court, all of which were strangely in favor of big business and exceedingly distasted ful to the people of the whole country, were the income tax decision, the stock-dividend decision (by which $2,000,000,000 in stock dividends were exempted from taxation against the known wishes of the Congress), the Newberry primary expense decision, and the minimum wage decis- &lt;&nbsp;ion discussed in our last issue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">MONG the many things for which the South claims priority over the North is the invention of artificial ice, the self-binding reaper, the threshing machine, and the Gatling gun. Orphan asylums, industrial schools for girls, the weather bureau, and the charting of ocean currents had their origin in the South. The first steamship to cross the Atlantic sailed from Savannah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the Civil War it took the 3,000,000 of the Northern armies four years to conquer the 600,000 men of the South. One Southern regiment which entered the battle of Gettysburg with 800 men came out with less than eighty. When the army of Lee surrendered at Appomattox, it had been without food for three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the South come 99% of the sulphur of the United States, 100% of the turpentine and resin, 99% of the phosphate rock, 90% of the aluminum, 75% of the gasoline, 66% of the commercial fertilizers, 60% of the graphite, 60% of the natural gas, 57% of the petroleum, and 60% of the world’s cotton crop. Every year it ships North several hundred thousand carloads of fruits and vegetables. There are 135 mountain peaks in the South the summits of which are more than 5,000 feet above sea level. The value of the South’s manufactured products in 1919 was slightly under ten billion dollars. It has ten percent of the active cotton spindles of the world. It has 91,100 miles of railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Denver to Galveston is 779 miles less than to New York; from Kansas City to Port Arthur is 518 miles less than to New York; from St. Louis to Mobile is 359 miles less than to New York.

<p><span class="font5">The Health Commissioner, Frank J. Monaghan, calls attention to the dangers to which vacationists are exposed. Many vacationists return to the city with typhoid fever, due to the fact that the country water supply is not so pure as that to which the city dweller is accustomed. The old oaken bucket that hangs in the well sounds well in poetry; biat it has too many microbes in it to suit a city dweller that is accustomed to getting absolutely pure aerated water out of an iron pipe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE unusual disturbance under the bed of A- the Pacific Ocean, and extending down through Mexico and South America, continues. We say unusual because this area has always been more or less volcanic and subject to earthquakes; but the phenomena this Spring are more pronounced than usual, and scientists are anticipating the possibility of new lands being heaved from the ocean bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After showing signs of increased activity for several days Mount Etna belched forth on June </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font5">with alarming vigor, terrorizing the inhabitants for many miles and destroying homes and growing crops and vegetation in every direction. Many small villages dot the slopes of Etna, and the people fled from their homes as immense clouds of smoke and blazing cinders were hurled hundreds of feet into the air. The eruption was accompanied with a series of loud </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">explosions and deep </span><span class="font5">rumblings, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at times violent earthquakes shook the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">top of the mountain glowed with </span><span class="font5">white heat, and five streams of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">running fire </span><span class="font5">streaked down the mountainside; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">while the </span><span class="font5">spectacle was majestic in its wonderful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">boom of </span><span class="font5">fire-works </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and racing rivers of lava the </span><span class="font5">people scrambled for safety.

Rapidly these flaming waves </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rolled </span><span class="font5">Z toward the villages at Etna’s base. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heroic </span><span class="font5">-J efforts were made to save the towns by digging j trenches and diverting the oncoming </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">flow of . -</span><span class="font5">liquid fire; but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">intense </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">heat and the rain of </span><span class="font5">ashes made these noble souls flee for their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lives,</span></p>

The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">whole </span><span class="font5">threatened territory became a praying country; 3 superstitious ideas brought to their minds Dante’s Inferno and the “end of the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why cannot people be taught the truth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that * </span><span class="font5">these convulsions of nature are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but evidences </span><span class="font5">that our earth is going through its </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">preparatory </span><span class="font5">stage, making it eventually the peaceful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">habi-</span><span class="font5">tation of man, where nothing shall hurt </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nor &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">destroy, instead of looking upon them as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">burning up of the earth?

<p><span class="font5">One of the most beautiful lakes in the United States is Crater Lake in Southern Oregon.

The Old Faithful Geyser throws out its stream of steam and hot water at exact intervals of sixty-four minutes; it is always on time; it never varies. The Sawmill Geyser and the Lion Geyser make noises corresponding to their names.

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Rome to Rule the World?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Impero,</span><span class="font5"> organ of the Fascist! (Roman Catholic) movement, which has destroyed Italian liberties, comes out with the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Rome must rule the world of reason. We are convinced that the world’s welfare and prosperity will thereby be advanced in the highest degree. We aspire, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">dream, we prepare for a now era of Roman suprem</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">acy. </span><span class="font4">It is necessary to draw a sharp line between those </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">born to rule </span><span class="font4">and those born to obey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where did we hear that stuff before? Sounds like some corpse of the dark ages trying to push the lid from off his coffin. A despatch from Rome says that the Pope is putting in a Fascist! army in place of the old army which went on strike for shorter hours last summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adolf Keller, Secretary of the Evangelical churches in Europe, reports that the middle classes, which have heretofore supported the Protestant churches of Europe, have almost vanished, and that as a consequence the Churches are passing through their most critical hour since the Reformation, many of their activities having already come to an end and the remainder being threatened with extinction. This is playing directly into the hands of Rome; and as a consequence the pro-Roman press is boasting that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Pope </span><span class="font5">today </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hae more </span><span class="font5">real power than ever before in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the first time since the Reformation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">British sovereign has visited the Pope at Rome. At the same time he conferred upon the Anarchist Premier Mussolini the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. This may have been acceptable to Mussolini, making it unnecessary for him to take one. We cannot say as to that, but wo can say that it was a poor piece of business all around. The British Minister to the Holy See accompanied King George on his visit to the Pope. Why not have a British Minister to the Methodists, a British Minister to the Presbyterians, etc.? There is not a bit more sense to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the British press knew that the sentiment of the people of England was against this </span><span class="font4">act </span><span class="font5">of recognition of a bogus church by a monarch, yet all the appeals from the Protestants all over the country sufficed not to obtain recognition, showing that it had been determined beforehand to carry through the program willy-nilly. The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> is accused of suppressing a cablegram from a quarter of a million Canadian Protestants who protested against the visit being made. On the other hand there are ostensible patriots in England, such as Lord Halifax, who boldly advocate the complete surrender of the English Church to the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Papal pretensions spread. The first Roman Catholic Apostolic Delegate to South Africa landed there the last day of April. This man's-job will be <sup>£</sup>’to report upon ecclesiastical affairs, effect consolidation and advancement, secure unity of command and concerted action/' and to do such other things as are appropriate to a vicar of the Vatican. Incidentally he mentions that “at present there are about twenty such delegations, and the heads of states are pleased at this facility for communicating with the Vatican at Rome.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">EWS comes from Spain, supposedly the most Catholic country in the world, that the country is in a ferment which may result in a break between the Vatican and the Government. The new ministry, headed by Marquis Alhucemas, elected on a program guaranteeing freedom of religion, has received peremptory orders from the Archbishop </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Saragossa </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that it </span><span class="font5">must either break its election pledges or face </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">war between the church and state in which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the priests will do everything possible to knife the government under the fifth rib. At the same time we are told that a Fascist! movement is in the air. Of course; of course. It is in the air everywhere.

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HILE there are no great or outstanding events to note or report since last writing, there are happenings which may mean much to the welfare of this country and to Europe, or even to the world. Air. Bonar Law’s sore throat developed into a condition which made it necessary for him to relinquish the office of Prime Alinister of Britain; and in present circumstances almost anything politically could result from that happening. For the moment it appears as if the Conservative party will carry on without much outward change; for there is outwardly little rivalry showing in respect to the leadership—though everybody knows there is much rivalry not revealed. Had Lord Curzon not inherited his earldom, and therefore not by law been prevented from appearing in the House of Commons, it is almost certain that he would have been sent for by the King and have become the leader of the Government. He is a bigger man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font5">Mr. Baldwin. Under his leadership there would almost certainly have been an increase of reactionary politics, whether of attempted acts of Parliament or of orders in council; for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">recently stated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> this country, ostensibly ruled by Parliament, is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">really ruled by the inner privy council. Then </span><span class="font5">there would have come revulsion </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of fee</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ling</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">^ </span><span class="font5">and perhaps a hardening of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">opposition pl </span><span class="font5">the growing Labor vote. Now, with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a more mod* </span><span class="font5">erate man, as Air. Baldwin, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">power there </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fit </span><span class="font5">not the same danger of immediate </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">advancement </span><span class="font5">of Labor opposition.

The trade figures seem rather good on </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">report, </span><span class="font5">and the politicians try to make the most </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out of </span><span class="font5">them. But there are at least </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,100,000 persPns -</span><span class="font5">out of employment, and millions are living </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">just </span><span class="font5">on the poverty line. The country certainly holds together, but there seems no road out </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on <sup>r </sup></span><span class="font5">any of its difficulties. It is like a top in its </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">spin ’ </span><span class="font5">just when it is slackening.

But there are on the increase both in London and in other great centers those degrading pleasures, the dancing saloons and night clubs which destroy body and soul, making and gaining their appeal to the people. These cater for those who will indulge self at any cost to themselves or to any one else, or at the cost of the welfare of the community among whom they live.

The church organizations have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font5">holding their annual meetings in London, and have been encouraging themselves because after many years of loss of membership they are able to report some increases. They cannot, however, keep up with the increase of the population, even though the increase is less than normal; and so their outlook is but poor. They seem to have gotten past their yearly wail about the loss of spirituality in their churches.' They<sup>r</sup> more frankly turn to material things; for now their congregations are only to be converted to the good works which are their means for amending the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one of the largn meetings a reverend gentleman rather boldly stated that the attitude of the ministers had been all wrong when they urged the congregations to support the World War and when they themselves became such active recruiting agents. The audience gave hearty applause. The newspaper man who reported said that it is a very different thing to applaud under such circumstances. He wondered what the clergy would do if again they were called upon by the Government and by sentiment. No doubt the clergy would again take the popular way; for they no longer represent their professed Master, Jesus 'Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font5">AY 6th Judge Rutherford gave his now famous lecture, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die,” in the auditorium at St. Paul, when about 3,800 gained entrance and about 3,000 were turned away. In the neighborhood of $1,200 was spent by the I. B. S. A. in advertising the lecture in the newspapers of the Twin Cities. Good reports of the lecture were furnished to five of the papers, some of these promising a good writeup. The lecture was easily the biggest piece of news for the day; but the writeups of the lecture were very short, from two to about eight inches, single column, each. This is the result of the edict of &quot;higher ups” who own or control the metropolitan press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidently, in the audience sat Mr, Wm. F. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Markoe, </span><span class="font5">special correspondent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Tribune</span><span class="font5"> of Dubuque, Iowa, which is said to be the only Catholic daily newspaper in the United States. The report is so manifestly fair that we publish it in full. His &quot;barque of St. Peter” is the Catholic Church, and his &quot;Vicar of Christ at its helm” is the Pope; but who should object to little things like that! The article carried a two-column head and is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The half-page display advertisements in the secular press announcing the above lecture by Judge J. F. Rutherford in the St. Paul Auditorium recently, claimed that 13,000 persons had listened to him in Royal Albert Hall, London, while 10,000 had been turned away; and that 10,000 also had been turned away from Carnegie Hall [rather, Hippodrome] in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">**That these statements are true is not hard to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">believe</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">for the St. Paul Auditorium was packed to the highest seats in the top gallery, and the first announcement from the stage was that on account of the thousands who were unable to gain admission, another lecture by Benj. II. Boyd, of New York, would be given at 8 p.m. on the ‘March to Armageddon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That Judge Rutherford, who is not a clergyman but a lawyer, puts up a clever argument strongly buttressed with scriptural texts from every book in the Bible, if not every chapter and page, cannot be denied. His Bible knowledge seems prodigious and his familiarity with texts really remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“His claim, however, that there were probably more Catholics than Protestants in the vast audience was emphatically refuted by the fact that when invited to sing the hymn, ‘All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,’ the entire audience rose to its feet and joined heartily in the congregational singing which is thoroughly characteristic of Protestant worship, but practically unknown in a majority of our Catholic churches in this country I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A study of the sea of faces revealed many types of .foreign physiognomy, including the white, black, brown and yellow races, but not one that anyone would instinctively set down as Catholic. It was a conglomerate gathering stamped with the unmistakable characteristics of honest, earnest, sincere, old-school, Bible-reading Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The lecturer disclaimed any ulterior motives in getting his message to the people, declaring his only desire being to induce his hearers to read and rely on the divine promises, and thus fix their hearts and minds in these latter days of the ‘distress of nations? He indulges in no controversy, but discusses truths that are common to Catholics, Protestants, and Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Like one who has discovered the key to a Chinese puzzle, he gathers the scattered fragments, and pieces them together in a perfect fit, till the whole map or picture is complete. He finds the present abnormal conditions prevailing in the world clearly foretold by the prophets of the Old and New Testaments. He recognizes their fulfilment in the World War, famines, pestilences, revolutions, anarchy, and the return of the Jews to Palestine. He has the ‘year/ the ‘day’ and the ‘hour’ all figured out with remarkable accuracy; and everything happens exactly on schedule time as planned by God and foretold by his prophets centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He sees the world today under the dominion of three great forces which have linked hands for their own selfish interests and are exploiting the people while governments are powerless to curb them. They are commercialism, or ‘Big Business’ and ‘Profiteers/ statesmanship, or ‘Big Politics,’ and ‘ecclcsiasticism/ or a faithless clergy who are supported by the first two forces, amf preach everything but the gospel of Jesus Christ. He flays a false clergy, though lauding their office as the most exalted on earth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“His analysis of the late ‘Interchurch World </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Move</span><span class="font4">ment’ is rich. ‘It is/ he says, ‘what its name really implies; to wit, the world moving the church, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">church moving in the way of the world? ‘The movement is really organized in the interest of big business and political forces? He quotes a writer who says: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">,‘We </span><span class="font4">are proud of the large sums of money we are able </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">raise by our mass movements/ acting all the time as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font4">silver and gold could take the place of spiritual </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">power </span><span class="font4">and the grace of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He describes the impotence of the League of Nations and various Peace Congresses in the words of Isaiah 8: 9, 10—-‘Gather yourselves together, 0 ye people, and be OVERCOME, and give ear, all ye lands afar off; strengthen yourselves, and be OVERCOME, gird yourselves, and be OVERCOME. Take council together, and it shall be defeated; speak a word, and it shall not be done; because God is with us? He declares: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘The </span><span class="font4">inducing cause of the League is admittedly fear; faith in God and His promises is entirely ignored?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The old order of things ended legally in 1914 at the beginning of the World War, exactly as, and at tha time, the prophets foretold it would. A new era will be established in the Jubilee Year, 1925. (Convening </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Vatican Council?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is impossible to give an adequate idea of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lec</span><span class="font4">ture which is attracting so much attention in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">these ’ </span><span class="font4">latter days of which ‘both David and the Sibyl sing/ when the world seems to be tossed on the waves like </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">ship without chart or compass, and even the stars </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">hidden behind dense clouds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">“The lecture as printed in pamphlet form of 128 pages, including seventeen pages of references to Scripture texts, is worth perusing, not so much for the supposed proofs of the lecturer’s thesis, ‘Millions now living will never die/ as for its remarkable record of the concrete and specific fulfilments of prophecies in this age. Our Lord Himself declared: ‘As in the days of Noe, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be: for as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, even till that day in which Noc entered into the ark, and they knew not till the flood came, and took them all away: so shall also the coming of the Son of man be?—Matthew 24: 37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The barque of Teter, like Noe’s ark, is the only craft truly that rides the mountainous waves securely, with the Vicar of Christ at its helm, against which our Lord Himself has promised: ‘The gates of hell shall never prevail?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All those who wish to live forever, will do well to take passage on this second ‘ark’ whose safety has been insured by Jehovah Himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>The Plan of the Ages</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">?-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE Bible is the grandest of all books; it is God’s plan-book and revelation to man. We will very briefly scan its pages. We affirm that rightly translated it is true, though wo will concede that each lias the right to decide this for himself. If any cannot accept its inspired message, this does not militate against its infallibility, and the reason may be apparent in what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man was created mentally, morally, and physically perfect. Such a wonderful being does not exist today. He was placed on trial, not to see whether God should take him to heaven, but to test his fidelity to his Maker; if loyal, he would have everlasting life on the earth. He disobeyed and began to die. In a dying condition he did not have the virility to transmit an undying life to his offspring, hence they were born dying and under condemnation. St. Paul affirms that &quot;by one man’s disobedience sin entered into the world and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.’ This is the cause of our aches, pains, diseases, loss of eyesight, hearing, speech, and is the reason why some people hate each other. All the asylums, penitentiaries, and graveyards are the ^direct result of mankind’s being corn' denined in Adam, the first man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God loves His earthly, cast-off, rebellious children; for He recognizes that personally they are not fully responsible for their misdeeds. . He saw in advance the course the world of mankind would take; so He arranged for a wonderful redemption, and formulated a plan for our recovery which would be the most conducive to our eternal welfare—teaching us the undesirability of sin and the reasonableness of keeping ourselves in the love of God, and the happiness that would result thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That plan spans seven thousand years, divided in a general way into seven 1,000-year days. The first six are work, labor, trouble, and sorrow days; the last one is a day of rest, in which Edenic perfection with its joys and blessings of health and happiness will be in a process of restoration. God made promise to Abraham to this effect : “In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. . . . And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” God dealt principally with the pos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">terity of Abraham because </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of this promise^ </span><span class="font5">until they rejected His Son, Jesus. Sb Stephens-telling the Jews that God had not kept </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">promise with Abraham up to his day, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">pointing to the future for the Abrahamic blessings which were to come upon all. Stephen suf- -fered martyrdom for telling the truth.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts : </span><span class="font5">7:2-5,54-60. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Classes in Resurrection &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font5">T. PAUL throws a flood of Light on this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">question by telling us that the Abrahamic -“seed” is a composite body, of which Jesus is . the glorified “Head” and of which the glorified ' church will be the “body”—Christ- the husband ’ and the church His bride are made “one” in ■ the heavenly marriage. This is the “star” seedclass in the above promise; for they share in a celestial resurrection. Christ and His bride become the Second Adam and the Second Eve. When the seventh-thousand or rest-day period, shall have fully dawned then the billions of the human family, in the grave and out of it, shall be regenerated as the “sand” seed-class and &lt;&nbsp;they shall have their blessed portion here upon the earth; for they are to share in the terrestrial resurrection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jews might have had the cream of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">promise fulfilled to them and might have filled the celestial class to the full, no Gentiles being permitted to have the special faVor. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But as a </span><span class="font5">nation the Jews rejected the offer and crucified the Holy One of Israel. It was necessary </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">Jesus to die in order to become a Redeemer; ■ otherwise the world would have been without redemption and salvation. So God merely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">per</span><span class="font5">mitted the Jews to remain blind to their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">privi</span><span class="font5">leges and, because of their lack of faith </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">reverence, to exercise their own wisdom—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font5">lesson to show the futility of resting wholly ‘ upon human judgment. St. John says: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“He “ </span><span class="font5">came unto his own, and his own received </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font5">taken a “people for his name.” These are the other members of the church. It was not God’s purpose to take all the Gentiles, nor all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">any one family, for Christ's bride. He makes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">selection, an, election, of suitable characters for His purpose—elect and precious, the Apostle says. No injustice is done any one not chosen; it is God’s business.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">. not. But as many as received him, to them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gave </span><span class="font5">he power to become the sons of God; even </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to ' </span><span class="font5">them that believe on his name: which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are born, ? </span><span class="font5">not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God?’—John 1:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None of the heavenly or star class </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">selected before the days of Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He was th£ </span><span class="font5">first. The apostles and first </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">members of the' </span><span class="font5">church were Jews. Then God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">favor was extended to the Gentiles; and “out of them” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ha* </span><span class="font5">j</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">There is one sense only in which salvation is universal. The Bible says: “Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man”; “God will have all men to be saved.” Jesus is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world; and He himself said: “I give my flesh for the life of the world.” The proper thought is that as all have suffered the penalty of death because of one man’s disobedience, so by the righteousness of one man and by His sacrifice, dying the Just for the unjust, the free gift of an offer of life is to come to all. It is expressed in familiar words: “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Everybody must, therefore, have one opportunity for believing in Jesus; or else He died measurably in vain. But Christ did not die in vain. As all who lived before Jesus’ time did not, could not, believe in Him; as many millions have been born and have died since Jesus’ day without hearing of the “only name given under heaven whereby we must be saved”; and as there are many living today who have never heard of Him, it stands to reason that there must be a day future when these people will hear the words of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How the World Receives its Blessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HEN we come to see the plain teaching of the Word of God that the “day of salvation” and the “day of judgment” and the “thousand-year reign of Christ” are all the selfsame </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">day, </span><span class="font5">what </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">flood of light illumines our poor, dull minds! For this day Jesus taught His disciples to pray, saying, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.” We should not let our minds become dosed to the proper thought by the mistranslation of St. Paul’s words, “Now is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font5"> day of salvation.” Paul never wrote those words. Note first that the text, 2 Corinthians 6:2, is a parenthetical statement, and is quoted from Isaiah 49: 8, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">reads: </span><span class="font5">&quot;In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">an</span><span class="font5"> acceptable time have I heard </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">thee, and in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> day of salvation have I helped thee.” This unquestionably refers to the overcoming church of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gospel age. This com</span><span class="font5">pany must be chosen and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">raised from the dead </span><span class="font5">to a resurrection glory in heaven. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These, with </span><span class="font5">Jesus, become kings and priests to reign with Christ a thousand years. Now notice particularly the last part of verse 8, which says: “I will preserve thee [Christ and the church made one], and give thee for a covenant of the people [the world of mankind], to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages.” Here the Prophet says that the “thee” class is going to bless the world—the “heavenly” seed is to bless the “earthly” seed. “In thy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">seed shall all </span><span class="font5">the families of the earth be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“God hath appointed a day in which he shall, judge the world in righteousness by that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font5">whom he hath ordained,” and “when the judgments of the Lord are abroad in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” Is not that a glorious prospect? The judgments therefore are to be uplifting </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">not downcasting; they will be corrective, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font5">couraging, and a blessing to all. The knowledge of the Lord is to cover the earth as the waters, cover the sea. A new covenant will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">made in </span><span class="font5">which God will write His law in the inward parts of humankind, write it in their hearts, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo </span><span class="font5">that it shall no longer be necessary for a man to say to his neighbor or to his brother: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Know </span><span class="font5">the Lord”; for they shall all know God from the least even unto the greatest. The ransomed of the Lord are to return from the graves and live upon the earth, come into harmony with the Lord, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">if they</span><span class="font5"> will, and thus shall “be accounted worthy to obtain that world [or age, or order of things], and the resurrection from the dead.” These, explains St. Peter, shall be refreshed and have life-privileges granted unto them in the “times of restitution [or restoration] of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.” The world of mankind are to live on the earth forever, and not in heaven. “The righteous shall inherit the 1-a-n-d, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">dwell therein forever.”—Psalm 37: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Presently, The tabernacle of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be with </span><span class="font5">men, and he will dwell with them, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font5">shall be his people, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">himself </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">shall be </span><span class="font5">with them . . . and shall wipe </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all tears from </span><span class="font5">their eyes, and there shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be no more death.’ </span><span class="font5">—Revelation 21: 3,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>The Light of the World </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By John Dawson</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">N A recent article in the Chicago </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner </span><span class="font5">the Editor assembles the opinions of H. G. Wells, Rev. Percy Stickney Grant, the Bishop of Lincoln, and the Archbishop of York as to the why and the wherefore of the empty churches of Christendom. The Archbishop of York attributed the present wave of indifference to religion partly to the war, in which all of the ideals of Christendom were shattered. He said also that signs of indifference to religion are to be noticed in the literature, art, and music of the country. The Editor expresses himself thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After all, religion is a big factor in the lives of most nations. The editor of a leading magazine in London is asking distinguished bishops and prominent laymen, Raders in thought and opinion, to give their views on the controversy raised by the Archbishop of York in England and Dr. Grant in New York.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One feature here which is, perhaps, unnoticed by the distinguished bishops and prominent laymen is that a man of the world—a magazine editor—is calling the attention of the higher-ups to the condition of things in the churches; and the higher-ups are frankly stating their own opinions. When Pastor Russell very gently and kindly called their attention to the approach of these conditions thirty or forty years ago, the higher-ups in the churches were ready to skin him alive. The modern church, so-called, has spent vast sums of money ostensibly to convert the world; but that it has made a miserable failure witness the World War. And now the unconverted world asks the high dignitaries in the church and prominent laymen for their opinions as to why the churches are half empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who is the Light of the world? An old hymn said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin ; The light of the world is Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the higher critics boldly and coldly announce from their pulpits that they no longer have faith in Jesus and much less faith in the Bible, the Word of God. Evolution and the survival of the fittest “have got 'em going.” If they have lost faith in Jesus as the Light of the world, they cannot help but lose faith in prophecy; for “the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Revelation 19:10) The empty churches witness to the fact that the world is passing its judgment. While Jesus is still the Light of the world, the churches </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">ceased to reflect that light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Churchianity’s Light is Cold—Lifeless &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font5">R. WELLS in his comments says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This is an age of great distresses, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but it is also </span><span class="font4">an age of cold, abundant light. People know </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">more than &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">was ever known before. As the Archbishop </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of York &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">says, ‘people are repelled at the mysterious chants </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">motions and incomprehensible sacraments. Until </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Chris- </span><span class="font4">j tianity sheds these priestly and theological </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">incumbrances </span><span class="font4">it will encounter greater and greater difficulty in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">serving.’ </span><span class="font4">Him it claims as its founder—the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Son of man? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Wells further says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I think religion is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">larger thing than </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christianity, </span><span class="font4">j and will go on, a growing power in the hearts of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">men, 3 </span><span class="font4">though they cease altogether to call themselves </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Chris</span><span class="font4">tians. I would suggest that Christianity sell all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that it * ; </span><span class="font4">has and follow after Jesus of Nazareth; that it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">scrap </span><span class="font4">its theologies and organizations, and taking neither </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">scrip , </span><span class="font4">nor purse, set out to find the lost kingdom of God.” d</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may remark here that Mr. Wells, in com- &nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mon with many other men prominent in the &nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">world of affairs, fail^ to distinguish between </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">churchianity;</span><span class="font5"> and also that the lost kingdom of God is just around the corner, so to speak. The trouble with the dis- i tinguished bishops is that instead of studying &gt;1 the Book of God, they have been studying the i books of this world; and of the making of these A many books there has been no end. The kingdom of heaven Jesus once likened _to treasure 1 hid in a field, which when a man had found^Jie -sold all he had and bought that field. But do —■ not think for a moment that the man found the hidden treasure without first digging for it, and * digging deep. The sweetest water is deep down; and so the sweetest truths in the Bible are found only by hard and steady digging; and while the J learned bishops and ecclesiastics have been in- -1 dulging in their strifes over foolish questions ; and genealogies, etc., against which Paul warned them, like a thief in the night the Lord has &gt;&nbsp;quietly been selecting his jewels, and this work j of selection is just about finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said: “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, but is among you.” (Luke 17:21, margin) It is gratifying to know that all the controversy in the world will not delay the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom; and whether the parties to the world-wide contjo- ■ versy like it or not, “the kingdom of heaven </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is ' I </span><span class="font5">at hand.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font5">WAS obvious that Wynn did not Eke being defeated in his discussion with Palmer about the immortality of the soul, neither was he satisfied that the last word had been said. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">few days later when opportunity offered, he opened the subject again, &quot;Mr. Palmer/' he said, “I have been thinking over what you said about immortality and it appears to me that you dealt only with certain points that suited your views and twisted the Scriptures to harmonize with them, but overlooked entirely many important passages upon the subject. The Bible says that at death the spirit returns unto God who gave it. Surely this passage proves that the soul exists after death? If not, how do you explain it?’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before answering your question/’ replied </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Palmer, </span><span class="font5">“I would like to know what you think is the difference soul ?”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">between the spirit and the gave</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">“There is none. Both terms refer to the same thing/' quickly replied Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It surprises me that so many Christians quote scriptures without taking the trouble to find out what they mean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What do you mean?” asked Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I mean,” replied Palmer, “that the words of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scripture are not used loosely, but have a definite' meaning. There is a distinct difference intended in the use of the words spirit and soul. In the original two different words are Used which must not be confused with each other. On questions of this kind the Bible explains itself. We must not go to it with preconceived notions and make certain passages </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mean </span><span class="font5">what we want them to mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Bible explains this one just in the place where it would be expected to do so, even in the account of the creation of man. And its statement is simple and clear if we accept the matter as stated. The record is, ‘God formed man of the dust of the ground.’ This statement refers to man’s body, which was made out of the elements of the earth. But more than an organism is necessary to make a conscious living being; and so we further read that God ^breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul? The body with</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font5">the spirit is dead, and the spirit without </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">body is merely inanimate power. But the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">operation of </span><span class="font5">the spirit of life in the organism </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">produces a living soul. Man does not </span><span class="font5">possess </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">soul; he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> one.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark118"><span class="font5">soul resulted. Man became an intelligent, sen-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark119"><span class="font5">tient being; he became a living soul. ,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark120"><span class="font5">&quot;The question then arises, What occurs when</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark121"><span class="font5">a person dies? The Bible answers it in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">text</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark122"><span class="font5">you raise; and bearing in mind what we have</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark123"><span class="font5">seen of its teaching respecting man’s creation,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark124"><span class="font5">the words are full of significance. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The body</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark125"><span class="font5">goes back to the earth, from whence it was</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark127"><span class="font5">it. It is the spirit of life which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God</span></a><span class="font5"> had breathed into the body of man which goes back to Him, and not the soul. The spirit had $5 no consciousness before its contact with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the ■/ </span><span class="font5">body, but it produced consciousness by its oper- /S ation; this same spirit leaving the body carries &quot;&nbsp;no consciousness with it to God. Consciousness 3 has to do with the soul. What happens to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">soul at death? It ceases to be. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">soul is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the J </span><span class="font5">effect of the operation of the spirit of life on </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">5 particular organism; and just as any effect <sub>d </sub>ceases when the cause of its existence-ceases, ' so it is in the case of a soul. <sub>k</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;When the current is switched off from the lamp, the light which was the result of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">operation goes out. Whither does it go? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">just ceases to be. So with the soul: When the spirit of life leaves the body, man becomes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as '■ </span><span class="font5">he was before he was created—unconscious, non-existent.”—Psalm 146:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But,” broke in Wynn, “why does the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible. </span><span class="font5">J say that the spirit goes to God who gave it?” J</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Because when once the spirit leaves the body no power on earth can restore it again. Only &lt;&nbsp;God has the power to bring to life the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dead;&quot;^ । </span><span class="font5">therefore the spirit is said to be in His hand.” -—Psalm 31: 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>&lt;c</sup>What is the purpose of the resurrection?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&quot;Do you mean to say that the more-alive-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'dead </span><span class="font5">ones need to be judged a second time?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;How is it the second time?&quot; asked Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;If at death the good go direct to heaven and -the wicked to hell, is this not a judgment? And if they are judged at death what purpose can there be for another judgment? Can it be possible that the infinitely wise God has made a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mis</span><span class="font5">take that He has to consider the matter a second time? Do the righteous need to be brought from their heaven of bliss and the wicked from their place of torment to see if some mistake has occurred? Why, the thing is ridiculous! There is another point: If the soul does not die, how can it be resurrected?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is the body that is to be raised, not the soul&quot; said Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The body! Is the soul, which according to your theory is freer without a body than with one, to be reincarcerated? Do you call that a resurrection? The Apostle says: 'Thou foolish one, thou sowest not that body which shall be, but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth him’! What is the 'it’ of which the Apostle speaks? Why, the soul; for it is the soul that dies </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">it is the soul that is to be resurrected and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">given </span><span class="font5">&lt;1 a body, such as divine wisdom sees best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If the soul is not immortal,&quot; said </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Wynn, 7 </span><span class="font5">&quot;then there can be no hope of a future life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“You have said that before, but it certainly is J not true.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>208</sup>Hence </span><span class="font5">there were two reasons why it was utterly impossible for any of Adam’s stock or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">offspring </span><span class="font5">to redeem mankind: (1) Because all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">imperfect and could not provide the price; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and (2) </span><span class="font5">if the price were provided, it could not be presented in heaven by any such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>209</sup>Thus is evidenced to the human race a condition of absolute helplessness. Thus we see that mankind was wholly without power to release itself from the condition of death, and that there never could be any hope of any one of the human family enjoying life everlasting in a state of happiness unless God, in the exercise of His loving-kindness, should make some provision. He had promised to make such provision. His great plan provided for such. It is first necessary, however, for us to see man’s absolute extremity in order that we might appreciate God’s opportunity for blessing man-Idnd, and the great debt which the human race owes to Jehovah and His beloved Son for the provision made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>210</sup>If a man found himself and his family in a dungeon and a million dollars were required to release him, and he had not one penny, but a friend of his appeared and provided the money and released him and his family, that man would owe a great debt of gratitude to his deliverer. He would feel much gratitude in his heart. He would surely love his deliverer and would be anxious to do anything he could tor him. Adam and all of his family arc either in the prisonhouse of death or under the effects of death; and if we find that the great Jehovah God has made provision for the release and deliverance of all such from the tomb, the prison-house of death, with a view to granting them everlasting life, liberty, and happiness, then such fact should bring joy to every one who learns of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">a perfect man must be given as a sin-offering, it is now important to see if the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Son </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">whom He sent was qualified to meet the requirements of the law and be the ransomer </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">redeemer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;‘Tt is easy to be seen that Jesus when on earth could not have been merely an incarnated spirit being, because that would constitute a fraud, and God would not sanction anything wrong. He must be a man, perfect in every respect, equal and corresponding to the perfect Adam while in Eden. It is also easy to be seen that Jesus could not be part God and part man, because that would he more than the law required; lienee divine justice could not accept such as a ransom. The divine law definitely shows that the ransomer must be exactly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cor</span><span class="font5">responding to Adam, a perfect human being. How, then, did God send His Son? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And when </span><span class="font5">God sent Him, was He part man and part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Godt</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS ON “THE HARP OF GOD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What two potent reasons, then, are there </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">which make </span><span class="font4">it impossible for-Adam’s children to redeem their brethren ? fl 208. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Show how man’s future happiness wholly depends upon the divine provision for redemption, fl 209.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does man’s complete extremity enable us fo appreciate more highly the value of the ransom-sacrifice? fl 209. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we find the proof to be conclusive that Jehovah has made provision for the redemption and deliverance of all mankind, how should that affect the mind and heart of ever}' honest person ? fl 210.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Was it important that Jesus should be qualified </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">meet the requirements of the divine law in order </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">ransom the race? fl 211. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since ransom means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">exact corresponding price,</span><span class="font4"> had Jesus been an incarnated spirit being would He have been qualified to ransom mankind? fl 212.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Jesus had been part man and part God, would He have been qualified to meet the requirements of the divine law? fl 212.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What does the divine law definitely require as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font4">qualification of the redeemer or ransomer? fl 212.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age No.</span><span class="font5"> 97, page 555, paragraphs 7-9: These dates should read: “Abraham </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lived </span><span class="font5">from 2008 to 2183. . . .

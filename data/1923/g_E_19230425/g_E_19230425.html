<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Al-ak'shak, the</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN the </span><span class="font7">Danish navigator, Vitus Bering, discovered the sea and the strait which bear his name, he discovered at the same time </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">great peninsula which the Inuit Indians called Al-ak-shak, meaning The Great Country, and which we today call Alaska. The name which the Indians gave it was a most appropriate one; Alaska is a great country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The area of Alaska is 590,804 square miles; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font7">is as large as all that portion of the United States east and south of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and east of the boundary line be</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tween Ohio and </span><span class="font7">Pennsylvania. It is as large </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font7">England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain, and Portugal, combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Alaska were superimposed upon the Unit</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font7">States, the southeastern extremity would be in the neighborhood of Savannah, Georgia, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">western edge of the Aleutian Islands would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">in the neighborhood of Los Angeles. Not over half of the territory has been mapped; much of it is still unexplored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Aleutian Islands, stretching away from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">mainland of the peninsula in a southwesterly direction for a thousand miles, are of vol</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">canic </span><span class="font7">origin, ten of the volcanoes upon them </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">being </span><span class="font7">still active. The vegetation on these islands is limited to berry bushes and dwarf willows; but there are many varieties of flow</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ers, </span><span class="font7">birds, and animals not found elsewhere; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">for this reason the islands are very inter</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">esting </span><span class="font7">to naturalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is believed that a coaling station in these </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">islands </span><span class="font7">would be a profitable investment for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">ships engaged in traffic between Japan and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Pacific northwest, enabling the carriage of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">larger freight cargo than would otherwise be possible, on account of the large amount of coal needed for the voyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . The trans-Pacific lines come quite near the (Aleutian Islands. This is because the flatten</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font7">of the earth near the poles makes a great</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Great Country</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">northern arc shorter than a straight line from east to west. For the same reason Seattle is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">thousand miles closer to Japan than is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">San </span><span class="font7">Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the summer of 1920 the American Secretaries of the Navy and the Interior visited Alaska to make a selection of one of the islands for the proposed coaling stations; and at that time it was figured that under the new plan of -coaling at this half-way point between the Occident and the Orient the annual saving per 8,000-ton vessel would be $200,000, or one-tenth of the cost of the vessel itself.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Scenery and Climatt</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">S SOON as adequate transportation facilities are provided, Alaska must become </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">favorite resort for those who are fond of magnificent scenery. The mountains (McKinley, 20,460 feet; Logan, 19,550 feet; St. Elias, 18,024 feet) are the highest in America and nearly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">mile higher than the highest mountains in Europe, while the beauty and grandeur of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">fjords cannot be surpassed on the globe. The face of the Muir glacier is a perpendicular wall of ice 200 feet high and three miles wide, and yet it is small compared with others. Beside this glacier the glaciers of Switzerland </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">rivulets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a country as large as Alaska, and situated as it is partly within the arctic zone, no general statement of climatic conditions can be made that will apply to the country as a whole. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At <sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font7">Point Barrow in the dead of winter the temperature is 70 degrees below zero, the ground </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">frozen to a depth of forty feet, and the annual mean temperature is 25 degrees above </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">zero. </span><span class="font7">Point Barrorv is on the Arctic ocean, as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">far </span><span class="font7">north of the southernmost points in Alaska </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">Winnipeg, Manitoba, is north of Jaurez, Mexico. And the southernmost point of Alaska </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">in the same latitude as Winnipeg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Yukon river flows through Alaska from east to west in the same latitude as the middle portions of Norway and Sweden and Finland. In this valley a winter temperature of 50 degrees below zero may be expected for weeks at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">time, and the ice freezes to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">depth of from six to nine feet at one point where the river just touches the arctic circle. But the ice goes out in May, and from then to October the river is open, and vegetation flourishes on the banks. There are times in midsummer when the temperature at points in Alaska within the arctic circle ranges </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">high as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">86 </span><span class="font7">degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lower part of the Yukon valley, for a distance of five hundred miles, dips off sharply to the south, where its temperature is greatly modified not merely by the lower latitude but especially by the fact that it comes within the influence of the warm Japanese current, which does for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California what the Gulf Stream does for the British Isles, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe generally. In the lower part of the Yukon, and in the parallel valley to the south, the Kuskokwim, the climatic conditions are even now favorable to the development of plant life. As the summer days are long, the growing season while short in months is relatively long in hours.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Coast Region</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font7">ETWEEN the great interior and the coast region there is a chain of mountains which accomplishes two marked climatic effects: They shield the coast from the arctic winds, and act as a condenser for the moisture-laden winds which sweep across the warm Japan current. As a consequence, the coast region is relatively warm and, additionally, it is one of the rainiest places in the world outside of the tropics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The entire coast south of the Yukon is in the same latitude as the British Isles; the southernmost part of the Aleutian Islands is in the same latitude as Dover, England; and the commercial metropolis, Sitka, is on the parallel of Aberdeen, Copenhagen, and Moscow. Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and Christiania, the capital of Norway, are each farther north than Juneau, the capital of Alaska. Trond-hjem, an important Norwegian city, is in the same latitude as Nome and Dawson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the dozen or more ports of Alaska there is only one of any importance that is cut </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font7">by ice in the winter; the remainder are open </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">.3 year around. Some of these coast points </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">cold the year around, on account of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cold </span><span class="font7">rains and cold winds that come down from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">icy mountains, which are adjacent; but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">where £ </span><span class="font7">the mountains are farther back, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">summer 1 </span><span class="font7">temperatures are so mild that it is claimed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that j </span><span class="font7">in the territory in which the Alaskan railway -S operates the mean temperature is higher </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font7">j at Washington, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the Alaskan winters it may be said </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">general that there are no storms, that horses and cattle may be worked in the coldest weather without danger of being frozen, and that children attend school the year around, with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font7">interruptions because of inclement weather. The weather conditions for the children </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">more favorable in winter in Alaska than they are in North Dakota.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>What about Plant Life?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7"> WHITER thus describes the great valley of the Yukon, a place imagined by many to be a desolate waste:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“From end to end of the Yukon, one of the mighty rivers of the world, the traveler may wander during four months of the year and never see snow. Instead, there will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">tangle of rich vegetation, of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font6">forests, of grass that grows as high as a man’s shoulder, and of endless fields of beautiful plant life. Wild berries in great variety, raspberries, huckleberries, blackberries, cranberries, gooseberries, currants; beautiful ferns </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wav- </span><span class="font6">Y ing in the soft breezes, great beds of the purple lupins<sup>1</sup> ~ and the red columbine, wild celery and wild parsnip t growing many feet high, ponds on which float </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">greet </span><span class="font6">&gt;3 yellow lilies, with the purple iris bordering their banked ——all are everywhere.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At first that seems pretty strong; and w* would be inclined to take it as a perfervid utterance of some ultra patriot who has in his mind a vision of the future instead of the pretk ent. But government officials are not so apt ta-3i be rhetorical, because it is inconvenient to b» chocked up. Yet the governor of Alaska moBt than twenty years ago wrote: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'J</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Oats, wheat, rye, varieties of barley, buckwheat, cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, turnips, rutabagtl^-^ thyme, sage, horseradish, carrots, beets, parsnips, Mk’jS tuce, radishes, peas, horse-beans, onions, celery, clovw^;’|l flax, rhubarb, were planted, and nearly every one</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APML 25, 1923</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. ; brought to perfection. The cereals were planted the last of April, and. came to maturity with full plump grain the last of September; they grow with rank straw. Good garden truck was successfully grown as far north as Eagle City, upon the Yukon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor Georgeson, another government official, who has been in Alaska for twenty-one years, and who has charge of four agricultural stations there, says that the time will come when the Alaskan wheat fields will play an important part in the economy of the nation. And still another government official, Mr. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, is said to have made the ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement that when the fishing industry of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska has run out, as it already bids fair to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">do, its place can well be taken by the vegetable canning industry, particularly the canning of . peas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only farming areas thus far developed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">are along the line of the Alaskan Central Railway, which extends in a north and south direc&gt; tion from the coast to the center of the Yukon , ’ valley. The men farming here went to Alaska ’’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originally to dig gold. They are mostly un, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;married and need wives. Here is a chance for</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the girls. Take the boat from Seattle to Anchorage, and behave yourselves well, and you will be married in a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A In this district the soil is rich. Wheat, oats, barley, buckwheat, and vegetables thrive; potatoes mature; and the ordinary red-top grass, which in the United States grows to a height </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">p’</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font7">but eighteen inches, attains a growth of over </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">six </span><span class="font7">feet. Throughout this area are grown the finest of turnips and the crispest of celery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apples do not do well in Alaska, but some of y the trees that were planted in the old Russian . missions along the coast are still yielding sour fruit. At Rampart, in the Yukon valley, near the arctic circle, winter rye seeded in August '■ lived through the winter and matured grain the <sub>:</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following season. Barley seeded in May was</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ripe by the middle of August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A.. But while Alaska has even now 100,000 ; square miles fit for cultivation (an area larger k than Illinois and Indiana combined), yet until ■ the polar ice-cap has melted its principal future - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as a dairy country, or at least a country for</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the raising of domestic animals suited to its</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">peculiar vegetation. Alaska is striking in the y profusion of its wild flowers and. mosses.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>What of Animal Life?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HERE was a time when elephants and mastodons roamed over Alaska, and the ivory from the tusks of these monsters of long ago </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">still an article of commerce. There are furbearing animals, the sea-otter, marten, ermine&gt; sable, mink, muskrat, beaver, white fox, blue fox, red fox, black fox, polar bear, grizzly bear, black bear, glacier bear, and the Kadiak bear, which is the largest and most powerful flesheating animal known. There are wolves, lynxes, seals, walruses, and whales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the line of food animals are the moose, arctic hare, porcupine, marmot, squirrel, sheep, goat, and, most important of all, the caribou or reindeer. In its present condition Alaska is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">natural home for the reindeer, which is merely a domesticated caribou. The country is covered with thick reindeer moss, which it is estimated would easily maintain four million reindeer, probably it would maintain many times that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was originally </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">large herd of native caribou in Alaska; but the coming of the whites killed these off, although there are yet some herds on the north coast and in the mountainous hinterland, where the hunters have not been so thick as on the west coast. It was the destruction of these native herds that led </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the introduction of the domesticated animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About ten years ago Uncle Sam bought 1,200 reindeer in Siberia and placed them in charge of the school authorities of Alaska. They have proven a great civilizing influence, turning the natives from a hunting and fishing people into pastoral owners of property, with community interests and an increasing appetite for education. The original herd of 1,200 has increased to 180,000, most of them in the hands of the natives. Shipments of reindeer meat have been made to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another northern animal which. would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font7">well in Alaska and be a great benefit </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to; the </span><span class="font7">country is the Canadian musk-ox which feeds on the herbage which grows between the clumps of reindeer moss. This animal is valuable </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">its hide, its superb wool, and the meat, which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ia </span><span class="font7">much like beef. The musk-ox gets along well with the reindeer, and they would live side by side without quarreling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the empty places of Alaska could </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">filled with reindeer and musk-oxen, the two specie*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">would provide a great meat supply and be useful in ridding Alaska of the billions of mosquitoes which infest the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These mosquitoes develop and mature in the tundra or moss, rising in throngs to the shores of the Arctic Ocean. They sting even bears and moose around the eyes until these animals are maddened into miring themselves in the swamps, and they force the native hunters to wrap their heads in furs. How to get rid of these mosquitoes over so great an area is a great problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Salmon Fisheries</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE salmon fisheries of Alaska are the most extensive in the world, employing 20,000 people and yielding products of an average annual value of about $40,000,000. From the standpoint of the number of persons employed this is the most important industry in Alaska. It now bids fair to die out because of being overdone. The salmon catch for 1919 was only half that for 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The highway of Alaska is the Yukon. For ages its tributaries have been the breeding places of salmon innumerable. These great fish have been food for the native and for his dogs, winter and summer. Hunters, trappers, prospectors, miners, and travelers alike have depended upon them. Now the canning companies have taken so many that their destruction impends. Not content with taking from the river itself the 30,000 cases which Government regulations permit, the fishing concerns have stationed themselves just off the Yukon’s mouth, catching the fish before they can get into the river at all, thus preventing them from spawning. Tn this way the canning companies are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A4 the present time more than half of all the salihon product of the United States comes from Alaska. The herring and cod fisheries are also large. The halibut fisheries need further Governmental protection to prevent them from being exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Timber Supplies</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE most valuable of all Alaska’s timber woods is the yellow cedar, a straight-jrained And highly durable wood from which the Indians make their dugout canoes, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">some* </span><span class="font7">times seventy-five feet long by eight to ten </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">feat </span><span class="font7">wide and carrying 100 people. There is also </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">valuable wood for tanning in the balsam </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fir. </span><span class="font7">There is no timber north of the arctic circle. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The local wood of all work is the Alaska spruce, too knotty for fine work but yet the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font7">wood generally available for all purposes. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">estimated that there are twenty million </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">acres . </span><span class="font7">of virgin spruce and hemlock in Alaska, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all ... </span><span class="font7">owned by the Government; and that the yearly . : growth would provide a news-print product equal to one-third the annual consumption. Under the reign of earth's new King, however, it &quot;will not be necessary to tell so many lies </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">now, and the demand for news-print will not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">nearly so large. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Early History</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font7">WILL be a surprise to some to learn </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">the first steamships built on the Pacific coast , slid into the waters from the Russian shipyards at Sitka. The supplies for the first California <sub>t </sub>miners, their woolen clothing, picks, shovels, lumber, dried fish, and woodenware, were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pur</span><span class="font7">chased from the Russian-American Fur Company, with headquarters at Sitka. This company aimed to make Sitka a great city on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">th* &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">j</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">route from America to Asia, but found </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">too &nbsp;&nbsp;||</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">many difficulties in the way at that early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indeed, many of these difficulties still exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the time the Civil War came along, th* Jg Russian Government had tired of its Alaska® 41 undertaking. It had more land than it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">could w </span><span class="font7">develop or manage: it had become friendly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the United States ’Government; it wanted ft </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">'3 </span><span class="font7">buffer state between the British possessions </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ol 3 </span><span class="font7">North America and its own possessions in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the J’S </span><span class="font7">Far East. Accordingly William H. Seward, l| Secretary of State, who had an enthusiastic </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font7">belief in Alaska’s future, took the territory </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font7">her hands in March, 1867, for $7,200,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Russians and the trappers knew of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">gold </span><span class="font7">sands and placers, but it was not until </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">th* </span><span class="font7">‘j* United States Government had taken over th* , territory and discovered gold in large quantities on Douglas Island that anything in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">th* </span><span class="font7">J|l nature of mining was undertaken. From </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">one mine at Treadwell there has been produced </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">jg </span><span class="font7">over fifty million dollars in gold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">- </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">a|</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The second great discovery </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of gold was o* </span><span class="font7">the Canadian side </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the line, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the Klondik* </span><span class="font7">region, near Dawson, where the Yukon leaves the British possessions and enters American territory. This was in 1899, and resulted in one of the greatest gold stampedes in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a rush of tens of thousands of men into a vast country which was almost unknown. They went up every river and over every mountain pass. The struggle was so terrific that in one of these passes, the one through which the White Pass and Yukon railway makes its way from the headwaters of navigation on the coast to the headwaters of the Yukon river, the builders of the railway were obliged to remove the frozen bodies of two thousand pack-horses before they could grade the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One morning in June, 1899, while this railway line was in process of construction and two thousand men were busily engaged in the work, word reached the workers of a gold strike at a lake district something like a hundred miles away. By night there were only six hundred men left on the job; the other men had plunged into the wilderness, carrying their picks and shovels, but leaving virtually everything else behind them. There were thousands of cases of want during the next long winter, and no doubt many cases of actual starvation. In the end the American Government was obliged to rescue large numbers of the unfortunates and take them out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But Dawson is today a city of electric lights, waterworks, churches, theaters, club houses, banks, hotels, public schools, and elegant homes, with an assessed valuation of eleven million dollars. The subduing of the earth is a man’s job, but it pays in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thing which happened at Douglas Island, in the southern extremity of Alaska, and which subsequently happened in the Yukon valley near Dawson, happened again at Nome two years after the Dawson discoveries; and .Nome is in the far northwest, nearly two thousand miles away. A United States soldier was 'digging a well. Standing by was an old prospector who was ill and unable to follow the crowd that had rushed into the adjacent gulches. He recognized the &quot;pay streak,” and in twenty days took out $3,000 in gold. Then another rush as great as the Dawson rush occurred. People of every occupation took to burrowing in the sand, and the price of labor went up at once to $15 per day.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Production of Minerals</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">LTHOUGH there is not much gold produced in Alaska at present, on account of the high cost of labor and materials, yet it is claimed by experienced miners that at least $500,000,000 worth is in sight. There have been years in which the production of gold has gone as high as $29,000,000. In the one year of 1920 the products of all kinds shipped from Alaska to the United States were ten times in value the amount paid for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The value of the total mineral product of Alaska increased from $18,620,913 in 1919 to $23,307,757 in 1920, but the gain was entirely due to the increase in the output of copper. Alaska has the greatest copper mine in the world; but there is only one copper mine in the country that is not owned by the Guggenheims, and that one is controlled by them because they control the steamship line by which the ore must be brought out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mine production of Alaska embraces gold, copper, silver, coal, tin, lead, platinum, petroleum, marble and gypsum. The silver production thus far has been small, although it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">claimed that great deposits have been discovered in the southern part of the country. The iron thus far discovered is of a poor quality. Asbestos, uranium, zinc, and graphite have been discovered in large quantities. Alaska has the only tin mines on the continent; one of them, owned by a woman, produced tin to the amount of $40,000 in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Seattle Chamber of Commerce there is a lump of coal, weighing 1,500 pounds, which came from Cape Sabine in the Arctic ocean. Coal has been found at widely scattered points here and there all over the peninsula. Most of the coal which has thus far been mined is a sulphurous lignite useful for domestic fuel, but so poor for steam purposes that it has been found profitable in some places to import coaL The Geological Survey estimates that there) are 150,000,000,000 tons of coal in Alaska. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any country which has soft coal in large quantities has oil; and prospecting and development work in the search for oil is in progress. The Secretary of the Interior claims that the coal and oil of Alaska, if developed on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">large scale, would pay the bonus for the soldiers which the big business interests of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ths </span><span class="font7">country are so anxious (</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1)</span><span class="font7"> to see them get</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Transportation Facilities</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">LASKA’S pressing need is better transportation facilities. Any country develops in proportion as its transportation facilities improve. The time will come when a trunk-line railway will run down the Mackenzie valley from Edmonton, up the Peace river, and thence down the Yukon valley to Bering Strait. The strait will be tunneled and, by that means, there will be completed a railway around the world, so that those who prefer to travel by rail may go virtually anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But at present the only way of getting to Alaska is by the Canadian steamship line or by one of the two American lines. The travel is light because the population is small and scattered, and the rates are high. The two American steamship lines, the Alaskan Steamship Company, owned by the Morgan-Guggeulieim interests, and the Pacific Steamship Company, charge the same rates and are probably both under Guggenheim (American Smelting and Refining Company) control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The shore-line of Alaska is 26,000 miles, greater than the circumference of the earth at the equator. It is claimed that on account of the magnificent scenery these bays, coves, inlets, and winding waterways offer a pleasure ground for summer cruising that is unmatched in the world. A year ago a white man, John Muir, traversed 800 miles of the coast alone in a small canoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Yukon is the great commercial artery of interior Alaska. This river, with a total length of 2,044 miles, is navigable for a distance of 1 ,S66 miles by light-draft ships. In the summer of 1921 there were forty boats engaged in commerce upon its waters. Six hundred miles above its mouth it is a mile in width.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Yukon is peculiarly fitted for navigation by the singailar circumstance, that it is without snags, and a boat may tie up at almost any spot desired. The reason for this is that its headwaters are in a southerly direction from the one place in its route to the sea where the Yukon touches the arctic circle. As a consequence the Yukon begins to thaw out in May at its very source; and the flood waters, cracking the great ice-sheet six to nine feet in depth, send it crashing, grinding and cutting its way to the sea in one of the most awe-inspiring scenes to be found anywhere. The winter trade begins as soon as the ice is of sufficient </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">thick* 1 </span><span class="font7">ness to sustain teams of dogs and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">loaded -</span><span class="font7">sleighs, and continues until the next spring. - :</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Government is in a predicament regarding Alaska, wishing to develop the country h (which it can do at once if only it will surrender ' body and soul to the Guggenheim crowd and let them operate it as a crown colony for the group which has already gobbled up many of the best mining properties in the world), and wishing to find some way to give the plain people a ;;; chance to get some of the riches with which the r country abounds. In the effort to save something for the people a policy of conservation has been adopted which means well, but which is really S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causing the country to go backward instead of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">k</span><span class="font7"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' The Guggenheims came near getting full con: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trol of Alaska some twenty years ago; but</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">President Roosevelt, in the effort to prevent it, issued an executive order reserving all the coal ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lands, the oil lands, the timber lands, and water</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powers, Fire Island as a moose reserve, and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- number of the Aleutian Islands as a fish and ' ' bird -reservation. The effect of these Teserva-; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tions has been to drive people out of the coun-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try, so that, it is claimed, sixty percent of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">white population have given up the fight and gone back to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would seem as though the Government should be able to find some happy mean be. tween an ignoble surrender to one corporation A and the discouraging of all initiative by malting so many restrictions; yet its efforts to keep the g . corporations, a few big ones, from gobbling up ' about everything worth gobbling in the United &quot;&nbsp;States, have not met with any reassuring success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The moment the restrictions are removed, that moment the giant corporation is in position to act, powerfully and effectively, while individuals or smaller concerns are handicapped by lack of capital. If a few honest officials could be found, it would seem as if the Government could carry much further the development so well begun by the construction of the Alaskan Railway. This is the aim of many of its statesmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alaska’s development should not be entrusted to one or many bureaus in Washington, but to the Alaskans themselves in a legislature of their own. There are now in Washington thirty-eight bureaus claiming and exercising jurisdictions in respect to Alaska’s affairs. They administer after some sort more than 300 reserves; and on account of the distance from Washington, conflicting claims, and the desire to exercise control, these bureaus have strangled the country, and for the time being have ruined it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this is all of God’s permission, and without doubt it is His pleasure that the natural wealth of the country should for a time lie largely unused; for shortly, under Messiah’s control, millions will be coming back from the tomb.

<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">E DO not wish to leave the subject without saying something of the smiling, optimistic, hopeful, purloining Eskimo, the blackhaired, black-eyed, hardy, home-loving and family-loving people that have followed the shores of the Arctic ocean all the way from northern Siberia to the eastern coast of Greenland, and that make up most of the native inhabitants of Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the Eskimos the family is the unit, independent of all other families. Marriages are arranged by parents while children are young, and are consummated by the bridegroom riding off with his bride to their future home. Women are the property of men. Polygamy is not uncommon, the second wife being taken about ten years after the first, and with the consent of the first, to assist in caring for the children. Among newly born children the death rate is high. Eskimo snow houses are sometimes lined with sealskins; the beds also are of snow, covered over with skins, and are not uncomfortable. The windows are blocks of ice, the air supply coming in through a hole in the roof.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In parts of Alaska the natives have their own cooperative stores, their canneries and sawmills, their power launches and electric-lighted homes. They even publish a magazine devoted to the interests of their race. They keep up with the whites in the public schools. Of 2,204 pupils in forty-seven schools, 1,255 or 56.9 percent are native born. Alaska is so well mixed that out of 408 students attending night schools for adults there were thirty-four nationalities represented, not counting the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The influenza wrought terrible havoc among the natives in the winter of 1918-1919, resulting in 1,500 deaths. Governor Biggs, of Alaska, said of the situation at that time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Whole villages of Eskimos lost their entire adult -.js population. Many infants were frozen in their dead mothers’ arms. To make matters more gruesome, ths half-starved dogs mangled and mutilated the dead and -,** dying. Reports are arriving of several villages having ’ been entirely wiped out and the bodies eaten by dogs. One little half-breed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">girl,</span><span class="font6"> picked </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">up in an igloo and -</span><span class="font6">hurried to the hospital, suffered amputation of botil 3 legs. I doubt if similar conditions existed anywhere in J the world, the intense cold of the arctic days, the long ”3 distances to be traveled by dog teams, the living chil-dren huddled against their dead parents already bein</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">g </span><span class="font6">gnawed by wolfish dogs. No assistance at that time 3 could he procured from any helpful agency. They were *3 ah too much engrossed with the woes of Europe to be 1 able to note our wards, dying by swarms in the dark i of the northern nights.”</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The “Star” of Bethlehem</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font7">OT many are aware of the fact that the “star” of Bethlehem was a fake star—a supernatural light given by the power of Satan —and the purpose was to destroy Jesus, who was declared to be a king and a savior. By reading the story this thought will more and more impress the mind. The point to be noticed is; God does not work through nor give any information through star-gazers, astrologers, or Magi. The “wise men from the east” were magicians. They saw the star and went to Herod, the wicked ruler of Israel. Herod had no intention of paying homage to the child Jesus, but sought His life. The wise men were warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod. When he saw that he was foiled he demanded the death of all the children in Bethlehem, two years old and under. But Joseph, being warned in a dream also, took the child and His mother into Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we might know, there was a sorrowful wail that went up from those Jewish mothers. “Rachel” represented the common mother of all those children. God foresaw it all and inspired the Prophet to write: “Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.” (Jeremiah 31:15-17) Thus is shown the resurrection of those babies; for they shall come to their own border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rev. W. A. Fite, of Kansas City, throws a little light on the subject. In part he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the minds of most people the Bethlehem shep--herds saw the star which appeared on the night Jesus was born and the Magi made their visit to him. on the same evening. . . . According to the New Testament the shepherds did not see the star and neither did the wise men reach the Christ and offer their gifts on tbs night of the nativity. . . . The land of the East seems reasonably to have been Babylonia. According to th* book of Daniel the wise men of Babylon were known U 'J Magi. . . . They started from the land of the East tn Jerusalem soon after they saw the star. But it required several months to make this long journey of several 13 hundred </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">tn il</span><span class="font6">ea, almost a thousand. And when they ar* . fa rive Jesus is no longer in a stable and manger, but inw^ house. He is no longer called a babe but a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was probably only a little less than two years old at the time of the visit of the wise men. Herod had asked them .Ji exactly what time the star appeared, and being mocked J? by the failure of the wise men to return to him, ha<sup>-</sup>sought to kill Jesus by killing all the male children ia Bethlehem, from two years old and under, according to jg the time which he had exactly learned of the wise men. Herod wanted to make sure of the death of Jeans, bait a| he did not want to kill any more children than was neo-essarv. He sought, therefore, only a safe margin between &quot;d the age of Jesus and the age limit for other children tp be killed.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wj</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">f &quot;PORTSMOUTH, the Portiig Magnus of the J- Romans, seventy-five miles south of Oxford, was the American's next stop. It is the <sup>z</sup> center of British navrd activities. Here Alfred '■ the Great fitted out his fleet that overcame the i Danes, and here Admiral Nelson went forth fc* with the fleet which destroyed the combined French and Spanish fleet off Cape Trafalgar, in 1805, and put an end to Napoleon’s well-laid plans for the invasion of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The British people hold Nelson’s memory in great esteem (despite the blemishes of his private life), because he had the indomitable grit <sub>t</sub> and courage which have made the British Empire. In 1801 he was with the fleet which destroyed the Danish fleet in the harbor of Denmark’s capital, Copenhagen; and when his attention was called to the fact that his superior officer had signalled to cease firing he put the telescope to his blind eye and said that he could not see the signal. This gave him great popularity in England. Three years previous, in the battle of Alexandria, he had destroyed all but two ships of Napoleon’s Egyptian fleet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Portsmouth one is shown several tablets <sup>E</sup>&quot; marking incidents in the admiral’s life, the hotel in which he stayed the last night on shore, the entrance on the dock through which he passed to his flagship, and the old flagship itself, the “Victory,” upon which he died in the ■ hour of victory in 1805, and which is now being ” repaired by public subscription. The yachts of Sir Thomas Lipton, by which he has on numerous. occasions for a generation endeavored to y regain the American Cup, arc made at Portsmouth. The dockyards here cover 500 acres, r Southsea Common, which extends to the beach, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font7">parade ground for troops; and the beach it-7<sup>J</sup> self is one of England’s popular seaside resorts, p</span></p>

On being set at </span><span class="font7">liberty Harold returned to England, was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">chosen </span><span class="font7">king, and tried to forget the promise </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">which he </span><span class="font7">had made under duress. But William </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">did not </span><span class="font7">forget.

<p><span class="font7">Brighton, forty-five miles from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Portsmouth, </span><span class="font7">is England’s chief bathing resort. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was an </span><span class="font7">unimportant fishing village until </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1750, wheh </span><span class="font7">one Dr. Russell recommended to his patients the hitherto unheard-of practice of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sea-bathing. </span><span class="font7">During the war it received such a great </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">influx </span><span class="font7">of Jewish visitors from London, anxious </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">escape the air raids, that it came to be jokingly called Palestine-by-the-sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the rear of Brighton ig a mountain commanding a view of the country and of the sea for many miles in every direction. On the top of this mountain the American patroled for some, distance earthworks thrown up by the Roman soldiers when they invaded Britain before Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font7">is a most peaceful scene now, part of one of the golf links for which rural England is famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The American wag entertained in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a home fax </span><span class="font7">up on the mountainside; he was to lecture that evening two miles away; there was a half-hour to spare, and he proposed to his host that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font7">cover the distance on foot. The host’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font7">daughters agreed to go ahead and set the pace; and yon had better believe now that they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">did. </span><span class="font7">The American is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">good walker; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he can do a </span><span class="font7">mile every fifteen minutes easily; he had heard of the ability of English </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">girls </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">walk, and he </span><span class="font7">had a good chance to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">see it demonstrated.

Southend is distinguished by the fact that it has the longest pier in the world. This resort, located at the northern edge of the mouth of the Thames river, has Buch a gradually shelving beach that it requires a pier one and one-half miles long to reach deep water, and for the convenience of the hundreds of thousands of tourists that come here during the season, there is an electric railway running between its termini.</span></p>

The first point of interest is Slough, eighteen miles from London; for in going west from Southend one must go through London. Here Thomas Gray, the writer of the “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” lies in the churchyard in which the acknowledged masterpiece of English literature was written. Although begun in the churchyard it required seven years to polish it into its final form. How sweet the words:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At Wantage, sixty miles from London, Alfred the Great was born in 849 A. D., and is fully entitled to the appellation usually attached to his name. It was he who gathered the Saxon people together into one nation, and who laid the foundation for the British navy. In his own times he went by the name &quot;The Truth Teller/’ a sufficient mark of nobility for any man. He codified the customs of the people into written laws. He overcame the Danes, then overrunning the country, by making Christians of them and teaching them to live by other means than depredations upon the peace-loving Saxons. His justice and modesty left a great impress upon history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Alfred was rising to power, but while he was still a fugitive from the Danes, he took refuge on an island, in the home of a peasant to whom he was unknown. The good wife set him the task of watching the cakes; he allowed them to burn and was severely scolded, but took the scolding in the meekest manner, and without revealing his identity as the king. He was a wise and just ruler, a friend of the common people, a scholar, and a far-seeing general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Wantage there is a curious stone called the blowing stone. It is a huge block of red sandstone pierced by may holes. The sound produced by blowing into one of these holes is like the bellowing of a calf and can be heard for six miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Uffington (Offa’s town), six miles farther west, is named after Offa “The Terrible,” king of Mercia, one of the six Saxon kingdoms which, in the latter part of the eighth century, covered the territory now embraced in England. Offa was the antithesis of Alfred the Great. He was as little and mean and brutal as Alfred was great and noble and magnanimous. But he was a good Catholic. He had his neighbor Ethelbert, king of East Anglia, secretly murdered, and then seized his kingdom. For this neighborly act he atoned by a work of great piety, the building of the Abbey of St. Albans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Offa also started, or developed widely, the scheme of sending to Rome money, which is now called “Peter's Pence.” He compelled each family in his realm that had property worth thirty pence to send one penny each year to Rome. This put this brutal murderer in solid with the king of heaven, earth, and hell; and no doubt we shall sometime be favored with a revised history in which Offa will be reverently referred to as Saint Offa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Uffington, cut through the turf into the chalk underneath, one may still trace’ on “Whitehorse Hill” the gigantic white horse, 353 feet from nose to tail, which commemorates King Alfred’s victory over the Danes here in 871 A. D. At Wootton Bassett, seventeen miles farther on, are still preserved the old stocks in which prisoners were once confined. At Chippenham, ninety-four miles from London, was born in 1800 W. H. Fox Talbot, one of the inventors of photography, and one of the first to decipher the inscriptions on the tablets recovered from Nineveh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bath, 107 miles from London, famous for its healing waters since 863 B. C., still preserves the baths erected by the Romans prior to the beginning of the Christian era. They are five in number, heated by flues beneath the floor, one of them lined with lead. The largest is 68 by 110 feet. The principal springs, four, in number, pour out 7,000 gallons an hour, at temperatures ranging from 108 to 117 degrees Fahrenheit. The angels on the Bath Abbey church are badly battered. Cromwell and his crowd were not strong in their admiration </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">anything designed or built by the Roman </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Cath</span><span class="font7">olic system, and took a delight in making the angels look as though they had been in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a prize </span><span class="font7">fight and got the worst of it.</span></p>

Bristol has a church with a spire 292 feet high, which leans “at an alarming angle.” But you need not fear that it will fall right away; for it has been leaning that way since as long ago as 1578, when mention was made of the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bristol has a suspension bridge 245 feet above the level of the Avon, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> tower erected in honor of John Cabot, theliardy Italian navigator who, sailing out of Bristol with a single vessel, in 1497, landed on the continent of North America, and followed the coast all the way from Labrador to Florida. The parliament of the time gave him in one lump a sum the equivalent of fifty dollars for discovering the new isle; and here is hoping that he did not waste </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">any </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> it, as it constitutes England’s sole claim </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">possessions on this side of the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Between Bristol and what once was Wales, but which now is Monmouthshire, the railway passes through a four and one-half mile tunnel under the River Severn. The tunnel, built after many difficulties from flooding, was completed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1886 at a cost </span><span class="font7">of £2,000,000. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">Severn, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">220 </span><span class="font7">miles long, has a tidal rise and fall of sixty feet, making it one of the most dangerous of rivers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">the unwary. The tide comes in so rapidly as often to cut off the retreat of those who venture •ut upon the flats revealed at low tide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cardiff, derived from a Welsh word which means City on the Taff, was the American’s next stop. Cardiff has the largest coal exports of any city in the world. The old Cardiff Castle, built in 1080, is still in use as a residence by the fabulously wealthy Marquis of Bute. The docks cons: -cted by the Marquis for his coal exports cover 200 acres and cost $20,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Marquis, although living in a Protestant country and obtaining his wealth therefrom, is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Roman Catholic. One can see the reason why </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">wealthy business man might prefer to be a Roman Catholic; for it is a religion within which one may by contributions and donations </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">money to the right man at the right time </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font7">himself solid with the Almighty, “as it were,” without having to give the matter any further personal attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Marquis is reputed as willing to sell his old castle when somebody with sufficiently much money, and sufficiently little common sense, comes along and makes him the right offer. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">a gloomy-looking old place that no sensible man would take as a gift. Robert, Duke of Normandy, suffered as a prisoner within its walls for the long period of twenty-six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At Llandaff, </span><span class="font7">a Welsh name which means Church on the Taff, is a church alleged to have been originally built by King Lucius in A. D. 180. The River Taff is famous because at ebb tide it is plainly but a small stream, while at flood tide it looks like a great river. It is this appearance of being what it is not that has given </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rise </span><span class="font7">to the expression that one is giving “taffy” when he flatters another. The good people of England rather seem to give the Welsh people as a whole credit for just this sort of thing; but perhaps the Welsh would feel more like dividing the honors with their critics in this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE name Wales comes from an old English word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Waelisc,</span><span class="font7"> which means foreign. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">that upon whatsoever land they set their foot 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">it is their own and that the real natives have only such rights as may be measured out </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">them; they are “foreigners.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Welsh hang on to their old language and | customs with great tenacity. It is estimated J that at the beginning of the twentieth century there were in Wales about twenty percent of the population who knew no other language than AVelsh. The national singing festival, the Eisteddfodd, is believed to date from several a centuries before the Christian era. Welsh sing-. ing is of note the world over; Adelina Patti made it so; it is a treat to hear it in Wales M itself. The rhythm, the time, the swing, the accentuation, seem not duplicated elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The AVelsh names are a subject for despair: Ynyshir, Cribbrfawr, Glyncorrwg, Llwynhendy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Llanerchymyedd, Llanddewiaderarth, Lian-rhairdrmochnant, Llanfairpwyllgwnguillgpge- ' rydrobblandiailiogogoch. Good night; this is * as far as w’e go. A motto stands at the head of ’• the bed. It reads: “lesu Grist ddoe a heddyw __ yr un, ac yn dragywyddo.’’ It is the Welsh for Hebrews 13:8. Look it up; it may do you good. -It is one of the most precious texts of the Bible,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world is so closely bound together that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">strike in one part of the planet is immediately offset </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font7"> activity in another. During the Brit-&quot; i ish coal strike, fuel oil and coal were brought ;; into Britain in larger quantities than ever before, thus cutting down the Cardiff market </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">its main product; but when the coal strike was 5 on in America it became extremely </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">active.

Swansea is the chief center of the copper, tinplate, and spelter industry of the United Kingdom, and has the largest tube works in the country. Llanelly, nine miles still further on, and the end of the American's journey in Wales, is distinguished as the site of a smelting works which has a chimney 320 feet high. The singing in Llanelly is a thing to be remembered with joy forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS not until the year 1284 that the Germanic races which overran England finally succeeded in bringing Wales into submission. One of the terms of capitulation required the surrender of one county to England in each century’, but the arrangement was discontinued. The last of the counties alleged by the English to have been transferred to England, and by the Welsh alleged still to be a part of Wales, is Monmouthshire; and in order to perpetuate the doubt still in their minds as to whether they are in either England or Wales, the residents of Monmouthshire, if they live in Newport, prefer to have their mail addressed neither Newport, Wales, nor Newport, Eng., but Newport. Mon. So, unless you want to appear foolish, do not ask a resident of Newport -whether that city is in Wales or whether it is in England; for you are likely to get the mystifying answer that another man did, &quot;It is not in either; it is in Monmouth.” And it may take you some time to get the facts upon which the answer is based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chepstow is one of the stops on the way out of Wales. Here Henry Marten, one of those who signed the death -warrant of Charles I, ■was imprisoned in one of the towers of the fortress for many years. The view of the river Wye here is charming. Chepstow was the southern end of Offa’s dyke or wall, built by Saint Off a &quot;The Terrible” to keep the Welsh away from those English fields which had belonged to Wales from time immemorial, and to keep them back in the Welsh mountains. To this day Welsh is spoken on one side of this dyke, and English on the other. The village of Newnham, sixteen miles farther on, cherishes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">sword presented to it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">King John </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font7">seven hundred years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gloucester, well over the border from Wales, in the west of England, is an ancient Roman city containing a church begun by Abbot Serio in 1089. Here is still the old Parliament House, wherein sessions of Parliament were held when Parliament was a perambulating body. Here also is the oldest inhabited house in England, formerly the prior's lodging of the abbey. It is now a deanery. A dean is a man that has a job in a cathedral. A cathedral is a church-building which may or may not house a church. A church is a company of God's saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gloucester contains a house the upper story of which consists of a disused railway coach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty years ago there were on the sand lots of San Francisco, looking out over the Pacific (the best location for homes in the whole city), perhaps fifty old street-cars which had been improvised into dwellings. They made a picturesque sight, but one not to be envied. Probably, they have long since been replaced with the beautiful bungalows for which California is justly famed. San Francisco readers might advise on this point. It was probably better to use these cars for temporary dwellings than to consign them to the flames as Syracuse did when inaugurating a new trolley system.</span></p>

Noticing that there were large numbers of children who had nowhere to go and nothing to do on Sunday, many of them factory employes, he engaged several regular day teachers to teach these children reading, sewing, and the catechism of the Church of England. The idea took, and in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">five </span><span class="font7">years it is estimated there were 250,000 children in England receiving instruction in Sunday schools.

<p><span class="font7">At Stratford-on-Avon, fourteen miles from Gloucester, the American saw Shakespeare’s birthplace in Henley Street, where they let you inside the door for a shilling (25c) but not otherwise. He walked over the same path which Shakespeare used in courting his beloved Ann Hathaway; and at Shottery, a mile away, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">beautiful old English country village, the same size as it was four hundred years ago, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he saw </span><span class="font7">the pretty thatched cottage where Ann Hathaway once lived. They also let you into the Hathaway homestead if you have another shilling with you, not otherwise. The wide fireplace and ancient furniture are all as they used to be when Will was courting Ann. In America all places of general public interest are purchased and maintained at public expense. The handsomest thing in Stratford is the monument to Shakespeare erected by George W. Childs, of Philadelphia, Pa., U. S. A. It occupies the center of the public square. It is free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thirteen miles north of Stratford-on-Avon, enroute to Birmingham, the train passes in plain sight of Warwick Castle, situated on a massive rock on the right bank of the Avon. In its palmy days this was one of the strongest castles in England. The main gateway was so arranged that attackers could be treated to a bath of hot lead on the way in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (1428-1471), was at one time the most powerful nobleman in England. Related to both the houses of York and Lancaster, he threw his great forces first on one side and then on the other, making and unmaking kings at his will. Five hundred retainers, the pick of English chivalry, dined regularly at his table in the castle; and it took six oxen per day to satisfy their appetites. The Warwick vase, which held 163 gallons of ale, and which measures five feet eight inches in diameter at the lip, is still preserved. The Earl </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Warwick died with his boots on at the battle</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Birmingham makes a greater variety of metal articles than any other city in the world. Fifty years ago believed to have the worst municipal government in England, it is now the best governed city in the world, almost entirely due </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Mr. Joseph Chamberlain’s far-seeing wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Mr. Chamberlain became mayor </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font7">began on a huge scale the common-sense plan of municipal ownership of public utilities, which the lying press of America so delight to ridicule and try to make impossible.

<p><span class="font7">The slums have been replaced by magnificent buildings owned by the city; the cost of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">gas has </span><span class="font7">been cut to about 50c per 1,000 feet. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Publid </span><span class="font7">schools, public markets, sewerage system, swimming baths, manual training schools, tram cars, all are of the best and are owned by the city.

<p><span class="font6">“There is no question that all the peace conference* and diplomatic gatherings of the nations are practically useless to bring in the kingdom of God.

<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Concentrating Newspaper Power</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font7">ONSOLIDATION is a wonderful word. The theory is that “in union there is strength.” This is the wisdom of finite minds. There is also the saying that “one with God is a major</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ity.” </span><span class="font7">As Satan incites through fear, and God </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">love, we may easily see on which side the masses are. While evil men and seducers are waxing worse and worse, selfishness on the increase, and profiteering smothering the world </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">fulfilment of the Scripture which says: &quot;Every man’s hand [power] against his neighbor,” it is plain to be seen that the unifying </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">power works harm rather than good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In nothing is the centralization of power more dangerous than in the consolidation of newspapers, or the bringing of these great instruments of education under the control of any body of men. In one way a newspaper is an individual; it has brains, an intellect, and molds public opinion by its personal contact. The standard of beliefs of a periodical is seen in the editorials, and ofttimes in the style of the headings. We instinctively shun some people, because we do not care to fellowship them. We should do the same with newspapers, magazines, and books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A woman who sells herself is a prostitute. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">man who sells his vote, who stoops for present advantage or pleasure, is a prostitute. A periodical which sells its space to the furtherance of some propaganda or some movement which the management has some conscientious scruples against is a prostitute. The editor himself may not be a prostitute; for he may be forced to take a given course, in which case he is a hypocrite; but the paper which has sold itself </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">a prostitute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty-five leading newspapers sold out during the war to big business, to carry on a propaganda of hate, working the United States </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font7">to the frenzied participation in the greatest crime in the history of all wars; and this was prostitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Frequently there is a consolidation of newspapers in the cities, sometimes in smaller towns. We believe that where the managers and editors are noble men, have honest convictions, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">the moral suasion of good judgment, ■ound reasoning and broad vision for the wel</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fare </span><span class="font7">of humankind, the consolidations are bene</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ficial One </span><span class="font7">such periodical in the United States were better than a hundred thousand journals of lower standards. Our opinion is that it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">better for journalism to pursue independent lines until the Lord's kingdom is established </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the earth, and allow the people to take their choice meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So the consolidating influences in newspaper-dom should be carefully studied, noting the interests supporting the policies and practices of each periodical; and if sinister motives are seen, aggrandizement of power practised, infringements of . the people’s rights cunningly devised and trampled under foot, propaganda supporting special interests carried on, and a studied suppressing of valuable news for a co</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmuni</span><span class="font7">to which might be inimical to a privileged class, then each individual should reach a decision as to his own relationship to such publication, and treat it the same as he would an individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some who try to believe everything they read without reasoning thereon. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Almost </span><span class="font7">everything in our day is a lie. There may </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">good reasoning on a given subject; but if </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">deductions are made from false premises, what good is it! Politics is a matter of intrigue and cunning. Law is a matter of interpretation. Religion is a matter of camouflage—make-believe. Sanctimonious holiness and ultra-piety are barefaced and parading hypocrisy. Take your journals, books, opinions of others, and especially the preacher, with a grain of salt. In other words, get down to brass tacks and do a little thinking on your own account. Such </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">course will make the blood tingle through the brain-cells and warm them up; and purer, nobler and richer freedom of thought will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">fruitage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our opinion is that before long many periodicals will go out of business for want of support. When Messiah reigns, only purveyors of mental pabulum conducive to truth, righteousness, honesty, love, and good deeds shall be allowed to exist—if, indeed, they shall be. For may not the Radio become the daily news of the near futurei and this fully governed and regulated in harmony with earth’s new King—Jesus!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The old world has ended, and the new is superseding it. Changes are taking place at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">rapid rate, and none but those who study the Word of God can keep abreast </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the times. </span><span class="font7">And even these must be active.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Taxation is Getting Top-heavy</span></h5>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font7">IS not often that bankers will say that taxes are too heavy. Bankers, Eke other human beings, sometimes come together to talk things over—for the good of the cause. They are becoming consciously aware that ‘Tinge tax assessments” may bring about “disastrous results.” It became known that some concerns to which the banks had made large loans were heavily assessed in taxes, jeopardizing their stability as business institutions. From now on it will be the practice of the money lenders not only to make a closer examination of the business abilities of the borrowers, but to ascertain the amount of the taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed in financial circles that the tax assessments are increasing at the rate of $25,000,000 a month. This means almost $300,000,000 per annum, or about $3.00 for each person in the United States. It is a matter of much concern how long the people can put up with this burden. The bankers themselves do not look for an abatement of the rise in taxes short of two years. Neither do we. On the contrary, we expect the taxes to keep on goimr skyward until they tumble from their dizzy height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What do we pay for the privilege of owning our own homes and businesses? An appraisement of all the property would disclose the fact that about every forty years the entire value of the property is paid into the tax-gatherers’ hands. In other words, the government and state taxes absorb our property two and one-half times in a century.</span></p>

Another </span><span class="font7">leach upon the body politic is the property </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">is exempt from taxation. For instance, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">city of St. Paul there is about $100,000,000 worth of taxable property; and about $30,000,~ 000 not taxable, belonging principally to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Roman Catholic church.

<p><span class="font7">any good reason why this, too, should not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">taxed?

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">BOUT every form of government imagin-■ able has been tried out in the history of nations—from despotism to democracy. Perhaps the latter under the present conditions of “fallen” man has been the best arrangement, thanks to the liberty-loving people who came to America in an early day. But democracy is getting to be a farce because the principles have been abridged and the object thwarted. Socialists in New York and Michigan, duly elected by the people, have been retired to private life and refused recognition by legislative bodies. It often occurs that a really good man is elected to office on a platform which he independently will</span></p>

But the up-to-date method of tying an executive’s hands is through &gt;&nbsp;I? some kind of “bloc” devised and framed up </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">the “interests,” which are at work to block </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font7">legislation inimical to their ownership of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">earth, including the fence which surrounds </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it; </span><span class="font7">and the lobbyists are busy keeping tab, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">no innovation in beneficial legislation for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">masses may escape their notice, and that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">good intentions of a governor may be atrophied by a truckling law-making body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Al Smith was elected governor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font7">York by an imposing majority; and opposition to his proposed innovations which he </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font7">pledged the people, if elected, was unthought of. But we never know what lies beneath the surface—of politics and bigotry. He started in well, but finds himself blocked by combinations of varying interests at nearly every turn. Whether he hoped that some of the bosses would step in and oppose his ostensibly well-intentioned program we do not know, but if any good is accomplished it is always done in the face of obstacles. The masses therefore see that their desires, though expressed in the ballot, are invariably frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a governor of New York who expressed </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7">self something like this: What the world needs is a despot, if we could only find the right despot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We agree with the governor. And while the rulership under Christ will be kind and loving,</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">OMETI</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ME</span><span class="font7">S an obscure man will conceive a good idea. Mr. J. S. Coxey in 1892 undertook to interest Congress in issuing legal-tender treasury notes to the value of $500,000,000 to be expended in building good roads. If this idea bacLhpen follow’ed, and $100,000,000 in improved rotids had been added to our thoroughfares annually since, and graft among the politicians had been unknown, we might have been so enthused with road-building for the forthcoming and now present automobile that we would not have had money to squander in the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But Congress then, as now, was not willing to do anything really worth while for the common good. “The Commonweal of Christ.” or “Cox-Sy’s Army,” as it was called, started with a little band marching to Washington to press their cause as a means of supplying labor to the unemployed and relieve the poverty-stricken condition of some localities. That the mind of this motley crowd was fertile is seen by a banner which read, “Death to Interest-Bearing Bonds.” Yes, yes! Interest-bearing bonds, notes and mortgages are one of the curses of our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What happened to this “army” ? Its leader and some others were arrested on their arrival in Washington for “trespassing on the grass” (!) and were held for twenty days. The army went back to camp, but soon broke up and disbanded. Other “armies” were organized, but their efforts were fruitless, and the movement yet it will be just and equitable—a rule of iron softened with mercy. There will be no back talk, no successful opposition, no cunning, no deception, no meanness, no wickedness practised during Messiah’s reign. The desire of all nations shall come; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed with peace, liberty, happiness and, if they will, life forevermore. Perhaps the baffling of the people with its consequent disappointments is raising the issue as to what the desire of humanity really is. If these experiences lead ns to realize our true condition, that we may search and find out our utmost necessities, they are good things in disguise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us practise sobriety, quietness and contentment, do the best we can and wait on the Lord; for His set time to reign cannot be moved backward or forward.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Coxey’s Army</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">for favorable legislation soon came to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Leicester, England, last December, another “army” was organized. It called itself “the Soviet Republic of Great Britain,” and had its own lavs, its own constitution, and its own method of enforcing them. It was made up of unemployed, and they marched to join their fellows in London. Upon growing recalcitrant one of them was “arrested” by one of their “policemen,” taken before the “judge” and “jury” and sentenced to push a truck to London. The worst punishment they can mete out to an offender is to be “sent home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These movements are significant, taking place always in times of depression. Should want and famine continue to stalk about, and • railroad facilities keep on being crippled through broken-down equipment and high freight rates, there is no telling what may come to pass. If every unemployed man was put to work on public highways, fed, housed and treated decently, we believe that it would go far toward the amelioration of the present economic distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Soviet Republic of Great Britain” is called by the newspapers “a Gilbertian idea of a miniature Republic.” Another thing irritating the body politic today is that the newspapers are the weapons of plutocracy, and they never lose an opportunity to ridicule or denounce the efforts of the poor to mitigate their misfortunes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">T THE time of last writing the English winter was missing, and this called for the remark that some thought the seasons were changing. Now in the northern part of the country winter has come suddenly and in good supply. The northern part of England reports that there have been no snow storms for thirty years, or more, like the one that has descended upon it, from 100 miles of London northward. The young folks, healthy and well-fed, are getting some enjoyment out of winter sports; but the majority, and that includes the workers, suffer from dislocation of facilities of travel </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">their work, and in many cases are thrown out of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yesterday’s Parliamentary report shows that there were last week about 1,470,000 adults unemployed, which is said to be about the same number as in the United States, At the same time it was reported that the last available figures showing the total membership of trades unions in Great Britain was 6,500,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Practically all the railway companies in Britain are now included in four groups, an arrangement which has been forced upon them by the government. It is expected that this will bring about a considerable reduction in costs of working, and ultimately in cheaper passenger fares and freight rates. Urged by the government, which has had the railway leaders in counsel, much money is to be spent in enlarging stations and widening lines, and in extension works which have been held up since the outbreak of war. This will provide work for many people; and owing to the fact that the mines are now fairly busy, over two million tons of coal having recently been shipped to Germany, it is expected that the condition of the working classes will </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">helped to a considerable extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parliament is now busy discussing the iniquities of the previous government and forging epigiams about the present situation. But it is, of course, unable to do anything immediately to deliver the country from its predicament of unemployment, lack of trade, and its heavy burden of taxation. Mr. Lloyd George roundly denounces M. Poincare’s policy of taking France into the Ruhr district of Germany, but he is reminded that the French premier is only trying to do what he himself said should be done. On December 11, 1918, he said: “Those who started the war shall pay to the uttermost </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">far- 1 </span><span class="font7">thing, and we will search their pockets for it.’’ Of course there have been many changes since that date; and Mr. Lloyd George, like everyone else, has a right to change his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The British government now seems desirous of getting free from Mesopotamia, or Mespot, as it is familiarly called. That adventure </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font7">been an expensive one for Britain. An enormous amount of money was spent there during the time of the war, and besides financial loss the war there cost Britain 31,000 dead and 50,000 wounded. A heavy expense has continued since the armistice was signed: 160 millions sterling.have gone, and now it is found that . there is no oil there!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is a day of wonders. Belfast, which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was -</span><span class="font7">so recently a city of terror, is now in the midst ' of a moral uplift. The reform began apparently about the time the Editor of The Golden Age , left there. [T— ?—Ed.] The Pastor Nicholson has so wrought upon the people that apparently ■ it is a question now whether the policeman will . ’ be sure of his job there in the future. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many </span><span class="font7">employers have received back stolen goods; petty Grieving is on the decline; dozens of bags 3 of tools “borrowed” from shipyards have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font7">returned; a grocer was paid £5 that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a woman ' </span><span class="font7">customer had owed him for twenty years; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">over an hour an ex-sailor tried to persuade </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">th* </span><span class="font7">local pensions staff that he was not entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to -</span><span class="font7">a weekly disablement grant which he had been -v drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yesterday, speaking on shipping prospects; the newly-elected President of the Chamber </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of • </span><span class="font7">Shipping said: “The past year has proved </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">however deep the abyss may be into which ship- -ping has fallen, there is always the possibility of the bottom of the abyss dropping out. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">outlook today is much less promising than </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it ~ </span><span class="font7">appeared three or four months ago.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,;i 'defence, the city was conquered. That this is a type is well known to such as understand the Scriptures; for it is not without good reason that the antitypical significance is shown in Revelation 16:12. This prophecy speaks of the ’drying up of the great river Euphrates, which takes place before all the members of the true church have been changed. The friends of The Golden Age read with great interest that this scripture is already being fulfilled in America, in that many clergymen are leaving the churches, because the people (according to Revelation </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">17:</span><span class="font7">15 typified by many waters) are withdrawing their financial help and protection. We here in Germa.ny also see at present the fulfilment of this prophecy. As an example we cite the antichurch conduct of the Legislature and Government of Saxony, on account of which the churches are reduced to great poverty and a great many clergymen are starving and must give up their vocation. The only alternative is that the church must receive help, or she will collapse.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Also in other circles the fearful signs of the fast approaching end in our country are multiplying. Germany is a dying country, and in it dwells a dying race. Dreadful conditions with regard to sanitation and health are spreading, on account of the general dearth which resulted as a consequence of the occupation and reparation payments. The people are no longer able to provide themselves with the actual necessities ; therefore this condition of a general physical wretchedness of the German people threatens all of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indeed, when the Bible says that as a sign of the time of the end there will be famines and pestilences (Matthew 24:7) then our eyes see in this land a mighty fulfilment of this scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When on the one hand one considers the great distress of the poor people, then it remains for the natural man, unintelligent, not understanding the Scriptures, to marvel that beyond this such a fearful oppression of the poorest of the poor can be effected through fellow humans, as is done in consequence of the occupation of a large part of Germany. Following we give reliable statistics of the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font7">ense expense which is imposed upon the dying country and its fully pauperized people by the victors, particularly France and England:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The army of occupation requires 3,600,000,000 gold marks every year and in addition approximately 25,000,000,000 paper marks. The Reparations commission alone costs as much as the salaries of 90,000 high officials of the German Government. An English General-President receives, according to the rate of salary for last October, apart from his living expenses, yearly 78.6 million marks. An English private draws, also apart from his board, a round five million marks yearly. On the other hand, the Chancellor of the empire receives, including all allowances, only 3,530,000 marks yearly. A minister of the State draws yearly 2,952,000 marks —not even three-fifths of the income of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font7">English private or that of a clerk of the control-commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Surely the Scriptures are fulfilled; for verily it could not be more apparently true what is written in Matthew 24:12, that, because of the abounding of iniquity, the love of many, t. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">e.<sub>r </sub></span><span class="font7">the great mass of nominal professors of Christianity, shall wax cold; and unkindness in the highest degree brings it about that people devour one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Be wise now therefore, O ye kings&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus speaks the Psalmist in Psalm 2:10. But che leaders in the earth are not yet ready to comply; they hope to hold on to their vanishing choice positions. By hook or by crook they endeavor to gather the necessary laurels which might guarantee a continuance of their exalted positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All of them do not understand how the same Psalm explains that God hath anointed His . King and that the world’s rulership is at an end. Love of gold and silver is indeed the root of all the iniquities that have occurred in tha earth, as Ezekiel states in chapter 7:19. But all of those who see the mighty signs of the Kang of Glory, under whose majestic steppings the kingdoms of this world pass away, pray with increasing yearning for the complete manifestation of His rulership.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HE general labor situation is very precarious. Canada is largely an agricultural country, with industries allied to the work of farming. Consequently a condition that produces a marked depreciation of farm product! </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has an </span><span class="font7">immediate effect on the entire labor market. There have been many cases of destitution amongst mechanics and laborers, and many of the larger towns and cities have posted notices in the railroad stations warning farm workers not to invade the cities as there was no work for them, and the cities would decline </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">responsibility of feeding men who came in from country points and became dependent on the community through lack of work. The delicate situation of the railroads, with the Government-operated lines in a condition of reorganization, has halted much projected work;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and railroad workers have been marking time all winter in the hope of an adjustment of the situation which would open up some work. The movement of the immense grain crop from the prairies provided a large volume of work for certain skilled trades for the early part of the winter, but this has tapered down now until little is moving. It is not known what 1923 will bring forth in the way of prosperity; but already the coal miners in the east and west are threatening strikes and the present railroad shop schedules and allied trade schedules, many of which run out in the spring, will provide fertile ground for further troubles that may well convulse the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The condition of the Canadian farmers is deplorable. A recent tour of the west has been Very illuminating with regard to this condition. Canada reaped her largest crop in history in the past fall; but on the average it appears to have cost the farmer more to raise and market his crop than he obtained from the sale of the products. The terrible slump in the cotton crops of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Texas, </span><span class="font7">with the ruining of vast numbers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the rural </span><span class="font7">population, has been well paralleled </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font7">West. The estimates following are from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">reliable source, and are vouched for by the largest daily paper in western Canada. Sixty percent of the farmers of the three prairie Provinces—Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba—are completely bankrupt today. Of the balance, not five percent are in any sense of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">word </span><span class="font7">prosperous, and the remaining thirty-five percent are in precarious financial condition. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">net debt of $37 against every acre under cultivation in the province of Manitoba (this includes money owing to farm loan companies, machinery companies, mortgage companies, etc.); and no one acre of land in the province can ever produce sufficient crop </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">■clear this debt. In fact, little more can ever </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bo </span><span class="font7">done under present conditions than to pay </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">little of the interest on the debt; and the local storekeeper who provides food and clothing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the farmer on a credit basis has, in the majority of cases, had to carry over a major portion of even this debt for the last three years. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font7">means that the farmer faces every season </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">expectation of a further deficit and a deeper sinking into the mire of bankruptcy. The cattte business is entirely disorganized. It neither pays to sell the feed, nor to feed it to the cattle and hogs in the hope of realizing from it that way. In southern Alberta the net debt against the farms runs to $5,000 against every quarter section (160 acres). The farmers are thoroughly demoralized; and the lack of success of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">provincial governments, largely composed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">farmers, to alleviate their condition, has brought many to the verge of desperation. A measure ~ is now before the Manitoba provincial House </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">s’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">provide for the passage of a law allowing, ft 'priority mortgage” against the crop of 1923, not yet sown, so as to provide funds for the payment of store debts, to enable the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">farmer </span><span class="font7">to obtain further credit in order to carry </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">another season. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The outlook is by no means bright for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Canadian farmer; the West is facing irretrievable ruin, and the Eastern provinces are not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">much better shape. It was stated in the Ontario ._g provincial legislature recently that the farmers in the East were continuing to farm, not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">because </span><span class="font7">of the money in it, but because of sentiment and of a love of seeing things grow. This </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ap- </span><span class="font7">-3 pears hardly a sound basis for farm prosperity. Given a continuation of the present disorganization of foreign markets—and there seems </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n® ’’<sup>!</sup>s </span><span class="font7">likelihood of a betterment of this condition—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">time cannot be for off when the complete breakflown of agricultural activity will be an accomplished fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PoEtically there are many storm clouds on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">horizon. The. Farmer Government in Ontario has been under heavy fire, and seems to possess but a weak defense against the many accusations of mismanagement and corruption hurled at it. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U. F. 0. </span><span class="font7">(United Farmers of Ontario) party is disorganized, and scarcely knows whether to repudiate its present affiliations so as fitly to represent its people or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">stay with the party policies in order to retain </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">modicum of political power. The Prohibition issue is coming prominently to the fore in some provinces, with a heavy leaning toward the admission of certain kinds of liquor to general sale, and a general modification of the Act. The drug traffic, which has become such an issue in other countries, is receiving its share of attention in Canada, and measures are being mooted to curb or destroy it. The present Dominion Government (Liberal) has shown no great aptitude to take hold of the country's problems, but has adopted a general attitude of “wait and see,” apparently hoping that if the European air clears, Canada can regain some measure of prosperity. The effect of this spineless policy on the public is quite noticeable, and many of the better class tradesmen are moving across </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">border, where some measure of activity still persists. The Government Immigration policy has caused considerable censure, many people demanding to know what inducement can be held out to a class of immigrants without capital, when the present inhabitants of the country are unable to find work enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The exodus of the Mennonites from the prairie provinces to Mexico because of violation of the agreement made with them when they left Russia, that they would not be called upon to do military service, has practically ceased, leaving thousands of acres of land vacant, but still held by them. Many of the soldiers who were settled on the land under the agrarian settlement policy of the Soldier Settlement Board, have left the farms so provided, for lack of funds to carry on. There seems little enthusiasm to accept any scheme put forward for land settlement as long as the financial condition of the farmer is so insecure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The denominational churches, particularly the Presbyterian and Methodist sects, are at the present time convulsed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">again over </span><span class="font7">the issue </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Church Union; and the battle rages merrily in the columns of the press. There have been many minor attempts at union by local churches, very few of which can be said to be in any sense oil the word successful. There seems to be on the part of the clergy very little actual open opposition to the spread of the truth at the present time. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">prominent policy to be observed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">this time, however, is that the ministers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">warning their congregations not to enter into arguments with “Russellites,” as they do not stand any chance in a discussion on the Scriptures; also not to read “Russellite” literature, as its tendency is to disturb faith in the teachings of the church. Several of the larger churches show deficits in their yearly balance sheets, and the appeal for funds becomes more and more insistent.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Report from Greece</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">THE peculiar political situation which has arisen here has been due to the irresponsible ruler of the country, the king himself. During the war, on account of his wife being the sister of the kaiser, he opposed the pro-Ally inclinations of the Venizelos cabinet, then in office. The king forced the cabinet to resign and proclaimed parliamentary elections, which returned the same ministry with a majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the king, still clinging to his own intentions and opinions, placed in power the political leaders of the minority. This caused Venizelos </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">leave Athens and go to Salonica, where ha organized a revolution and, supported by France, overcame the entire country, causing the dethronement of King Constantine and the deportation of his principal adherents. The Allies then placed on the throne the younger son of Constantine, Prince Alexander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dethronement of Constantine displeased the greater part of the Greek people, especially </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">the revolutionary leaders ruled with very, high-handed methods. This discontent came </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">a head when, King Alexander having died quite unexpectedly on account of the bite of a monkey, new elections were proclaimed. Venizelos failed altogether; and the old regime returned to power, with Constantine at the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Greek people expected much from the reenthroned Constantine, only to be disappointed. The government became entangled in a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">war </span><span class="font7">with Turkey, ending in the defeat of Greece and the loss of all the territories occupied by them as a result of the World War. The Turks, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">venging themselves on the Greek populations, burned to ashes numerous Greek villages, including the famous trading town of Smyrna. A great part of the people were put to the sword, thousands were kept as hostages, and thousands more escaped with their lives to Greece but in the worst destitution imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The defeat of the Greeks is believed to have been due largely to the propagation of Bolshevistic doctrines in the army, creating military anarchy. Nevertheless, to save the lost prestige of Greece and the army, some of the army officers organized a revolution in the isles of Asia Minor, took possession of the country once more, banished Constantine finally, court-martialed his ministers and put them to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ruling authority in Greece at present is this last revolutionary government, with one of the chiefs of the revolution actually ruling. Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of the democratic party, the crown is being given to the Crown Prince George, Constantine having in the meantime died of heart failure in exile in Italy. The fate of Greece largely rests upon the conference at Lausanne, the results of which are anxiously and painfully expected by all. Implacable hatreds and divisions have been prevailing among the people now for a period of about three years as a result of these unusual events. Only the strong hand of the government prevents the people from flying at each other’s throats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Greek kingdom has arrived at a financial impasse. The previous government divided in two all the paper money, thus depriving the people of half their property. Taxes have become heavier, numerous, and unsupportable. The English pound, once worth twenty-five drachmas, is now worth four hundred drachmas; and the American dollar, once worth five drachmas, is now worth over eighty drachmas. All articles of merchandise are proportionately dear, and the high prices grow daily higher and higher as the refugees continue to flow in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Victuals and articles of prime necessity </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">gradually diminishing and vanishing away. Life is becoming unlivable and unbearable for laborers and clerks, especially the latter. Consequently, Bolshevism, still in its infancy in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Greece, shows tendencies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">growth and £.» </span><span class="font7">strength; the black clouds of war, famine, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">4| pestilence are upon us. One can plainly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">discern ■ </span><span class="font7">upon their countenances the despondency </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">distress of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Keeping step with the political upheavals </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of .? </span><span class="font7">the last few years, Greece has witnessed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the .1 </span><span class="font7">most shameless spiritual fornication, the relig- y, ious leaders openly taking sides with the vari- ■ ous political parties and becoming mere politi- t cal leaders and electoral agents, a tool and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a ■ </span><span class="font7">toy at the hands of every political party. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Met- \ </span><span class="font7">ropolitan prelates are now overthrown as easily as ministerial clerks; and they deserve their i fate, as we shall see when we follow their deed*. . -3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Holy Synod, meeting in the capital, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sided &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">themselves at first with the royal party. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">They &nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">even went so far as to anathematize the insurgent Venizelos in an official and solemn way </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in kJ </span><span class="font7">one of the open squares of the city, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the -</span><span class="font7">presence of a multitude of the people, and . &quot;j accompanied by a festival ringing of the bells. g</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Owing to this action, when the revolution -a under Venizelos prevailed, the new government proceeded at once to the deposition </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of Arch</span><span class="font7">bishop Theocletos from the metropolitan throng, putting upon it the Venizelist Meletios instead. '.‘J Meletios was faithful to his chief. His religions 3 discourses were always colored with politics, and very often were only political lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the old regime was established, Mels- ‘■J tios was at once driven aw<sup>T</sup>ay, and Theocletos was brought back to the throne,. These changes &quot;3 affected the whole of the lower clergy. Retalia- f| tion was the order of the day. Meletios fled to ' -■? America, and all his friends were driven from „■£ power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But when the Venizelos element came back into power at Constantinople, it elected Meletio* Ts as Patriarch; and he was recalled to occupy ths patriarchal throne at Constantinople, which then happened to be vacant. The Greek church was thus for a time divided into two opposing clerical camps, each hating the other. Meletio* ** cut off his long hair. Now his followers h&amp;V* imitated his example, and the people have </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">SI </span><span class="font7">means of identifying the party to which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font7">- kS priest belongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-&quot;•j!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now, with the latest revolution in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Greece, </span><span class="font7">what has come to pass’ You must have already guessed it. Theocletos has been asked to reBig*, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">the Larger Synod has been convoked to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">elect his </span><span class="font7">successor. But Meletios is not satisfied even with this. He would like to nominate and appoint, in some indirect way at least, the prelates of Greece as he has done with those </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Turkey. As a result the Greek </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Church is filled </span><span class="font7">with the spirit of vengeance and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">anarchy,, the </span><span class="font7">opposite of the spirit of Christ.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>What Made Him Do It?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">F a priest of the Orthodox Russian church kills another priest because he cannot subscribe to all the tenets of the “faith,’’ what is the matter with his religionf This took place in Poland. Perhaps one of the greatest things in the world which cause distress, forebodings, fear, hatred, and jealousy is the false conception of Christianity. When vile, mean, and contemptible things are done by church members Christianity gets the blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If once the people get the proper thought that churchianity is not Christianity, and that nearly everybody is a “church” member instead of a Christian, then the unrighteous acts of the merely nominal Christian will not be charged to Christianity. Christianity is not to blame for a single unkind or unjust thought, word or deed. It is true that murder has been committed, &quot;holy&quot;’ wars have been fought, families and communities have been rent in the name of Christianity; but these were always resultant from a misconception or misunderstanding of the precepts and principles of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People have been forced into the “church”— the good and the bad, the ringstreaked and the speckled-through a misconception; and no </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font7">can measure the evil effects upon the world’s morality which the teaching that &quot;a person must be in a church to be saved” has really brought about. To force or to intimidate or to scare a person into any kind of religion only makes a hypocrite of him. To rob a person of the privilege of being honest does incalculable harm. Let the inquiring-minded person go to the Bible, and search in the books which point to the Bible, and he will make progress in the right direction.. And gradually but surely all department-store “brands” of religion will become obsolete and useless, and the world will be a better place to live in. Should a person thus searching for light die out of the &quot;church,” would he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">be the better prepared to stand before the judgment bar of Christ in the resurrection day than otherwise T</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And as we let our light shine we must not forget to be courteous, kind, tolerant and sympathetic toward our fellows. And should not </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font7">religious &quot;cults” bear this in mind!</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">T THE beginning of the war I was in Oklahoma, and had a commission as an officer. Consequently I was sent out on a mission of confiscating seditious literature, which included many copies of “The Finished Mystery.” I am ashamed and also grateful for that occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Through curiosity I appropriated </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">copy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">myself. That was in 1918. I read my copy only </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">last </span><span class="font7">summer, and with it the world literally turned over for me. God’s ways are indeed wonderful. I feel now that I am in tune with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Divine Plan. I understand it. And while </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I have received the two copies of &quot;The Finished Mystery” which you sent on my order. There will be at least one person missing from among the confiscators during the next war, if another attempt is made to confiscate your literature. If there are any suggestions you can offer whereby I can help the cause, I will gratefully accept them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Is There a Personal Devil? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE a letter from a subscriber who says: “I wonder if at some time an article coaid appear in The Golden Age to prove that there is a personal devil. I have a friend who is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">honest as can be, but who simply seems to think that the devil is only </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">system of error.” We are pleased to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only is there a big devil, whose name we know, and of whose personal history we have much information, but there are hosts of little devils whose names we do not know and of whose history we have little information. The Bible proves positively, however, that the big devil and the little devils, too, are all persons, very real ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a time when the big devil and all the little devils were not devils. There was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">time when they were sons of God, angelic sons, holy angels; although, even in that far-off time, when &quot;the foundations of the earth” were laid, “when the morning stars sang together, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and all </span><span class="font7">the sons of God shouted for joy” (Job 38:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">4,7), </span><span class="font7">they were on different planes of glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among these angelic sons of God, those early bright ones of creation, called by the poetic name “morning stars,&quot; there was one specially bright and glorious being styled “Lucifer, son of the morning.” (Isaiah 14:12) There is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">grand description of him in Ezekiel 28:11-19 in which, after explaining that this being was at one time in Eden the garden of God, the Prophet declares that in that embryo kingdom of God in the garden he was “the anointed cherub that covereth” (Ezekiel 28:14,16)</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">; i. e.,</span><span class="font7"> the task that was specially entrusted to him was to look after the interests of “the holy mountain of God,” God’s kingdom in the earth, over which Adam reigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although Adam was created in the image of God, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font7"> with reason, memory, judgment, will, benevolence, etc., and although he was created in the likeness of God, ruler over the earth (Genesis 1:26-28) as God is ruler over the universe, yet at first there was only himself in the ruling part of that dominion, though subsequently the beautiful Eve was given to him. Unfortunately for himself, when Lucifer saw Eve, and reasoned upon God’s method of establishing an earthly dominion, he said in his heart: I will estrange this pair from their Creator; instead of their worshiping and obeying</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Him they shall worship </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">obey </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">me; “I will </span><span class="font7">exalt my throne above the stars of God [the 1 other bright shining ones of the angelic fam-ilyj; . . . I will be like the most High.” (Isaiah -* 14:13,14) The temptation and the fall in the -garden of Eden followed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So then when in 1 John 3:8 we read that &quot;the devil sinneth from the beginning,” we are to understand that he sinned not from the beginning of creation, nor even from the beginning &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of the fashioning of our earth, but from the &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">beginning of the human race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thought was expressed by our </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord. ’ </span><span class="font7">When He said of the devil: “He was a murderer . from the beginning” (John 8:44), He locates -just the point of time in history where Lucifer 7 ceased to be Lucifer and became something else, a murderer; for the word “murderer&quot; simply; y means man-killer. Lucifer killed the first man, 1 killed that man’s wife, and killed all of their \ posterity; and in that act he ceased to be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Luci</span><span class="font7">fer (morning-star) and became Satan (adversary), the name by which he is now known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Devil, Satan, Beelzebub</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HAT the words Devil, Satan, and Beelzebub J refer to one and the same personage we can *3 see from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">comparison of certain passages </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">J the gospels. In the parable of the sower, as recorded in Mark 4: 3-20, it is Satan that comes immediately and takes away the word from the 7? wayside hearers, the hard-hearted ones. In </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">same parable, as recorded in Luke 8:4-15, it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">the devil that comes and takes away the word out of their hearts. The identity of the devil with Satan is thus established. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, j?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The identity of Satan as Beelzebub, prince </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">oi </span><span class="font7">J the devils, is established by the Lord himself. He had just healed one possessed with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a devil, </span><span class="font7">II one of the little devils, and had cast </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">him out. </span><span class="font7">“But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, -J| This fellow doth not cast out devils, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">'S Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. And Jesu* ji knew their thoughts, and said unto them, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every, </span><span class="font7">*7j kingdom divided against itself is brought .to desolation; and every city </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">house </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">divided </span><span class="font7">X against itself shall not stand. And if Satan </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cast </span><span class="font7">out Satan, he is divided against himself; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font7">-if then shall his kingdom stand! And if I </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">do you£ </span><span class="font7">J children cast them out!”—Matthew 12:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has other titles than those already enumerated. To our Lord he was &quot;the prince of this world” (John 14:30) that had nothing in common with himself, the prince that was to be oast out (John 12: 31), the prince that was to be judged. (John 16:11) To St. Paul he was &quot;the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” (Ephesians 2:2); and he was &quot;the god of this world [which] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.” (2 Corinthians 4:4) To the prophet Ezekiel he was “the king of Tyros.”—Ezekiel 28:11-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The question naturally arises, Why should the Almighty go to the trouble of deceiving His people by these references to Beelzebub, Satan, the devil, the prince of devils, the prince of this world, the god of this world, and the prince of the power of the air, if there is no such person, prince, or god? We will now proceed to examine some of his manifestations or characteristics.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Satan Can Move</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T SEEMS absurd, after what is said above, to prove that Satan can move; but movement of some sort is a prerogative of personality. Other things have movement also, but a personality that could not move at all would not be much of a personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first chapter of Job is the story of how that worthy prophet’s trials came about. They followed a visit of Satan to the court of heaven. “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.” (Job 1:6) The context shows where Satan came from; it was “from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it” (Job 1:7), and it shows that he returned thither on mischief bent when &quot;Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.” (Job 1:12) A similar occurrence in all its details appears in Job 2: 1,2,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the record of our Lord’s temptation, the account closes with the information that &quot;then the devil leaveth him” (Matthew 4:11); and the previous verse calls him by the proper name Satan, which is his since the time of his deflection. It was some person with a proper name that left the Lord; it was a personal leaving; it was a personal devil that left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Peter seemed to think that the devil could move. He urged that the Lord’s people should “be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Peter 5:8) Somebody has well said that Satan does not roar aloud. He waits until ha has one of the saints discouraged, and then gets down close and roars softly in his ears: “Now I have you 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only can the devil move slowly by &quot;walking,” as some of these scriptures put the matter, but he can strike up a faster gait when necessity arises. Curiously enough, this is when some discouraged saint concludes to renew the conflict. “Kesist the devil, and he will flee from you.” (James 4: 7) When the weary heart turns once more to the place of its rest at Jesus’ feet Satan realizes that his stock is below par, that he cannot do any business and that he is not wanted around the premises. He leaves in a hurry to look for some more likely place to do business.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Satan Can Hear and Speak</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TF </span><span class="font7">ONE doubts that Satan can hear and speak, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font7">let him turn again to the accounts in Job 1: 6-12 and 2:1-6 and read. There he will observe a dialogue between Satan and Jehovah in which, in the first instance, Jehovah addresses two questions to Satan, receives two replies, and then issues permission for Satan to take Job’s possessions but not to touch his person. In the second instance Jehovah asks Satan two more questions, receives two more answers, and issues permission to afflict Job’s person but not to take his life. Evidently, a person who can hear and answer four questions and receive additionally two permissions upon which he subsequently takes action, has those two very important adjuncts of personality, the power of hearing and of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another proof of Satan’s power to hear and to speak is set before us in the account of our Lord’s temptation in the wilderness. Three times Satan put clever propositions to the Lord, each time with an “if thou” attached to it, but . our Lord was not one of the “if” kind; and each of Satan's attacks was repulsed with an “it in-written” from the Word of God. Read the dia-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">logue, as recorded in Luke 4:1-13, especially verse 6, and see how perfectly Satan's claim there made agrees with the facts stated herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both of these accounts show that Satan can be seen. A further evidence along this line is our Lord’s statement in Luke 10:18: &quot;I beheld</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” Ezekiel 28:13 shows that somebody has seen him; for a description of his personal appearance is given. This does not mean that he could be seen by other than spirit beings, except by a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His appearances to our Lord in the wilderness were probably mental appearances, but just as real, just as personal, as though he had been present in a body of flesh.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Satan Steals Truth and Sows Error</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE parable of the sower, recorded in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mark 4:1-20, our Lord illustrates the four kinds of hearers of the Word by wayside ground, stony ground, thorny ground, and good ground. In his explanation of the parable he says of the wayside hearers, the hard-hearted ones: “When they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.” (Mark 4:15) Satan is a near neighbor and bosom friend of all hard-hearted people; he is always on the alert to take care of their business interests and to see to it that whatever religion they have is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">sham and fraud. He does not want them to have any truth, and they are generally of the kind that would not have it; they prefer prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But Satan is not only occupied in stealing away truth out of the hearts of his flock; he is interested in multiplying the hard-hearted class and he accomplishes these results by sowing error. The Lord tells about it in the parable of the harvest field. (Matthew 13: 24-43) The Master sowed good seed (truth) in his field, so that it would produce wheat (real Christians); but after the apostles fell asleep the devil sowed bad seed, so that he could get a large crop of children for himself. “The field is the world: the good seed [few in number] are the children of the kingdom; but the tares [the majority of professors of religion] are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil.” (Matthew 13:38,39) The Lord thus plainly hints that most church members are hypocrites. <sub>t</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Lord’s coming is accompanied by an energetic “working of Satan with all power and signa * and lying wonders.”—2 Thessalonians 2:9.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Satan. Plots and Schemes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE considered Jesus’ experiences in the wilderness where, as St. Luke reports the matter, he was “forty days tempted of the devil.” (Luke 4:2) The plotting did not stop with his efforts to turn the Lord Jesus to the accomplishment of his own purposes. It has continued ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul urges all Christians “to put 3 on the whole armor of God.” To what endf “That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” (Ephesians 6:11) Each Christian J is in the same kind of fight in which Jesus </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">engaged in the wilderness. It is not a battle with fists and feet. It is a battle in the mind, -g The new mind, the mind of Christ, is busily occupied in watching, ferreting out, Satan’s latest effort to dampen zeal, quench faith, and -S chill the spirit of love, and in defending </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">heavenly treasure by fresh efforts, fresh acliv- 't ities, fresh inspiration from the Book of books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same Apostle tells us respecting Satan that “we are not ignorant of his devices.” (2 Corinthians 2:11) A soldier who has no idea at all of the direction from which the enemy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">likely to come is placed at a great disadvantage. ;j| For instance, in the day in which we live, the logical thing for Satan to attack is the teaching respecting the Millennium, because the Millen- -S nium is at the door. That means an attack upon Pastor Russell or, since his death, upon the organization which he founded, and which now engaged in the work which he began. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font7">Satan did not bend every energy to discredit the International Bible Students Association,- Ja it would show that he was not “onto his job.” ^3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a cowardly and dishonest politician whose method of defeating an honorable and. able opponent is to bring reproaches against him; and that has </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font7">been Satan’s method </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of-</span><span class="font7">trying to defeat the Lord’s plans. It is for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">thisi </span><span class="font7">reason that the servant of the Lord must watch his steps “lest ... he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil” (1 Timothy 3:6); and it is because the ignoble man and the ignoble woman revel in gossip, slander, as respects deportment toward the opposite sex, that the one who would not be trapped must be unusually careful, in word and deed, not to give any just occasion or even any reasonable excuse for evil tongues to wag. But even then some will wag, any way. Some hearts are so full of evil that every act of kindness or courtesy, every smile or friendly word between Christians who happen to be of the opposite sex, is taken as an indication of gross moral depravity. Such persons need to have their minds fumigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle shows that the reason why some are ensnared by the adversary is because they are not watching, not wakeful, not alert. In describing the qualifications for an under-shepherd of the Lord’s sheep he says that they &quot;must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover [margin, awake] themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.”—2 Timothy 2:24-26.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Satan Suggests Thoughts</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS </span><span class="font7">very evident that when Satan took Jesus &quot;up into a high mountain” and &quot;showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,” and backed it up with the statement that “all this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it” (Luke 4: </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">5,6), </span><span class="font7">he was making suggestions to the Lord; and it is equally obvious that these were mental suggestions, inasmuch as there is not a mountain in the world from which such an outlook could be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thought of evil suggestion was back </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the proposition that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Lord should demonstrate that He was the Son of God by leaping off the pinnacle of the temple. It is also probable that when the devil “brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple” (Luke 4:9) this also was by suggestion, inasmuch as the account seems to show that throughout the whole period of temptation &quot;he was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">there in </span><span class="font7">the wilderness forty days, tempted of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan” (Mark </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1:</span><span class="font7">13), and not in Jerusalem </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of Satan’s suggestions come along </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">lines of Scripture quotation and exposition; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">in connection with this temple episode Satan quoted and misapplied the scripture (Psalm 91:11,12), “He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Satan can and does put thoughts into ^he mind we know from the scripture which tells us the circumstances of the Lord’s betrayal, of “the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him.” (John 13:2) Instead of resisting Satan’s suggestions Judas entertained them and eventually was completely obsessed, possessed, owned, controlled by Satan himself. The account shows that the obsession by Satan did not come until after Judas had made his bargain with the chief priests to betray his Master. The bargain took place before the Passover supper (Matthew 26:14-16; Luke 22:3-7), but it was not until the Passover supper was completed that “Satan entered into him” to possess him fully, so that the plan could be carried out without further delay.—John 13: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s suggestions are usually along the line of apparent righteousness, apparent goodness, apparent justice. It is for this reason that the apostle Paul says that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:14) If his real motives were evident on the surface he would find fewer dupes.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Satan a Powerful Monarch</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T WILL be noticed that when Satan claimed dominion of the earth at the time of our Lord’s temptation in the wilderness, the Lord did not dispute his claim, but subsequently referred to him as the &quot;prince of this world.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">risen Christ reiterated this thought of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s </span><span class="font7">power when he said to St. Paul years afterward:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Rise and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I now send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto G-od, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.”—Acts 26:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has children; they are many times referred to in the Scriptures. As instances see John 8:44, Acts 13:10 and 1 John 3:10. He has a church of his own, “the synagogue of Satan” (Revelation 2:9; 3: 9); and in St. John’s day Satan had, and he now has, a royal residence and throne, and that is in Rome. The throne itself is now in the Vatican. The way the Revelator puts the matter is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I know thy works, and. where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat [Greek, throne] is: and thou holdeet fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Autipas [Against-the-Pope] was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.”—.'Revelation 2 :13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The way that this has worked out in actual practice is that wherever there have been liberty-loving Christians they have been persecuted by such governments as were under Papal influence. And as the Papacy has always been conniving, and is still conniving, to run and boss every government on earth it follows that Satan has always kept Antipas in hot water. At present the Papacy has legates in Switzerland, from which they have been excluded for 185 years; and England has a representative at the Vatican. “Protestant” England bowing before Satan’s throne!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has “had the power of death” (Hebrews 2:14); for he has been the executioner of such aa have been turned over to </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7">.—1 Cor. 5: 5.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Satan Surely a Person</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HILE Satan can touch the Lord’s saints, in the sense of injecting thoughts into their minds, and thus seek to take away their places in the Lord’s kingdom (Ephesians 4:27),</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">yet he cannot grasp and hold them; for such ia! the meaning of the word translated “touch</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">eth”’ </span><span class="font7">i inlJohn5:18. They can “overcome the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">wicked. </span><span class="font7">one” (1 John 2:14), as some have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">always done, </span><span class="font7">and it is to such over comers that the promise , was given, “The God of peace shall bruise </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan • </span><span class="font7">under your feet shortly.”—Romans 16: 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other words, the time is coming </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font7">Satan is to be destroyed utterly (Hebrews </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">2: </span><span class="font7">14), and the saints are to have part </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in that </span><span class="font7">L;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">work of destruction. When the destruction takes place it will be a complete one, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font7">be a final one. The sentence is, &quot;I will bring forth a fire from the midst of time, it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font7">devour thee; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">will bring thee to ashes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font7">the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">terror, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">never shalt thou he any more.&quot;— </span><span class="font7">Ezekiel 28:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We think that a careful consideration of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font7">these scriptures covering Lucifer’s temptation and fall; his change of name to Satan; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font7">titles, as Beelzebub, Prince of Devils, Prince </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">This World, and other similar appellations; his powers of independent movement, hearing and speech; the fact that he has been seen and his appearance described; his powers of opposing truth and assisting error, of accomplishing signs and wonders, of plotting and scheming, of influencing and controlling thought, of rearing children and having </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">residence, a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">royal </span><span class="font7">throne, and a church of his own, should convince all who believe God's Word that the big devil is a real person, though an invisible one. In an early issue we will furnish correlative evidence regarding the little devils of whom, for long, he was the reigning prince.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” (<sup>IUD</sup>^^<sup>H</sup>^<sup>F</sup><sub>O</sub><sup>&lt;</sup>?<sup>D,S</sup>)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ittti</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, ffTTJ &quot;The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both aWE Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1,s</sup>Had Jesus been merely an incarnated being it would not have been necessary for Him to be born as a babe and grow to manhood’s estate. While He was born of a woman, yet He was without sin, because from His Father, Jehovah ; for He was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners” (Hebrews 7: 26); “and he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.” (1 John 3: 5) lie was without spot or blemish; therefore perfect and holy.— 1 Peter 1:19; Hebrews 9:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;’God says to us: “Come now, and let us reason together, . . . though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall .be as wool.” (Isaiah 1:18) We should reason upon God’s plan as revealed in the Bible, because He thus invites us to do. When w</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup>c see the reason why Jesus was made a man, why it was necessary for Him to be a perfect man while on earth, then we are glad and give praise to God. Had He not become a man, there would have been no hope for any of the human race to get life through Christ Jesus; and the Apostle declares that there is no other name given under heaven whereby mankind can live.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1TT</sup>The great ransom sacrifice is the most vital to man of the strings upon the harp of God, because without it no real lasting joy could be had by mankind. In due time its benefits shall result to the entire human race; and all who appreciate it will sing aloud and rejoice with exceeding joy. They will have melody in their hearts and upon their lips because of this wonderful provision made by Jehovah for man’s benefit. For thousands of years Divine Wisdom has been working out His plan concerning man; and the ransom sacrifice is the very pivotal part of that plan. Its importance cannot be overstated. It is the gateway that leads to life and happiness. It is the means of bringing back man into harmony with God. To appreciate this great doctrine we must understand it. Therefore let us reason together in the light of the divine Word, that we may understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;’The most precious thing possessed by any creature is life, because without life everything else would be useless and could not be enjoyed. Even now we observe that a man with but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">small spark of life clings to that with desperation. It is only when a creature is perfect and enjoying complete life and the right to it that he can properly glorify Jehovah, his great Creator. God’s great arrangement must ultimately bring glory to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;’Jehovah created Adam the first man in His own image and likeness. He created man perfect; for all the works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deuteronomy 32:4) He gave to man life and the right to life. Life means any conscious existence. Right to life means the full authority to maintain exi^fifcce. Adam and Eve in Eden were perfefffein their bodies, without pain, without sorrow; and were beautiful creatures. They had not a scar nor a mark upon them anywhere. They enjoyed life and all the blessings incident to that life. Their home was perfect; and even all the animals and birds of Eden were subject to them, and they had absolute dominion and control. God gave them all these privileges to enjoy eternally, upon one expressed condition; namely, that they be obedient to His law and thereby honor Him. He informed Adam that a violation of this law would bring upon man loss of life, loss of the right to life, loss of all,^he blessings incident to it.</span></p>

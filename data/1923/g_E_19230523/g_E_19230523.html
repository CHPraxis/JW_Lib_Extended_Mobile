<p><span class="font20">N</span><span class="font13">O, HEADER I This is not a religious article. We could make it one easily enough, however. We could take for a text 1 Corinthians 10:11: “They are written for our admoni-<sup>1</sup> tion, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” We could show that the Apostle must be referring to “time-worlds,” because the Scriptures speak of “the world that was,” “the old world,” “this present evil world,” “the world to come,” and the “world without end,” all of which have to do with our earth; and we could .. ■ call attention to the fact that he uses the word “ends” and not “end,” a distinction which some people have never noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But in this article we are about to discuss the literal ends of the literal world, not some convulsion or convulsions which are forever to dispose of this planet—for no such convulsions will ever take place—but the only ends which a whirling sphere can properly be said to have, the top end and the bottom end; in other words, the arctic and antarctic regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The reason for writing this article at this time is that the ice barriers at both ends of the world are melting, the ice fields about the antarctic continent are lessening; the Gulf Stream has recently torn a great hole one hundred and thirty miles deep into the arctic ice field, and the “scientists” who do not believe the Bible, and who therefore are unwise, are trying hard to establish the Darwinian theory, making monkeys of themselves in the effort to explain unscientifically what the Bible explains perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The true explanation of the polar ice-caps </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font13">very simple. When our first parents were placed in Eden, the earth was swathed in a band system of moisture similar to that which now envelops Saturn. Such a thing as rain was then unknown, “the Lord God had not caused </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font13">to rain upon the earth, . . . but there went </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">up a </span><span class="font13">mist from the earth, and watered the whole </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">face </span><span class="font13">of the ground.” (Genesis 2:5,6) This created a hothouse condition, in which the tern- 3 peratures in all parts of the earth were equalized, a condition extremely favorable to plant ;g and animal life, and the only possible explana-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">tion of the abundant evidences of such life </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">near </span><span class="font13">the poles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When this hothouse canopy was broken in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">days of Noah, and descended upon the earth </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">a torrent of water for forty days, then the sun ■ began to shine directly upon the equatorial regions, making them exceedingly hot </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">withdrawing the heat from the poles, where* accordingly, the flood took the form of a snow- ’ storm, piling the snow mountain deep. Masfo- <sup>: </sup>dons, antelopes, and other habitants </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of southern </span><span class="font13">climes have been found embedded in the ice </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the polar regions with freshly eaten grass,' undigested, frozen stiff in their stomachs. Some<sup>-</sup>of these creatures were so well preserved, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font13">4,400 years in this gigantic ice-box, that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">flesh was eaten when they were discovered. &gt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Doctor Hoel, geologist of the University </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">Norway, shortly before the publication of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Con</span><span class="font13">sul Ifft’s report, returned from an expedition which went as far north as 81 degrees, 29 minutes. This in itself is farther north tlian any other explorer of the arctic regions had </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">gone </span><span class="font13">one hundred years ago. Doctor Hoel found that there was scarcely any ice in the region which he visited, that the Gulf Stream there was warm at a depth of two miles below the surface, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">that well-known glaciers, formerly projecting great masses of ice into the sea, had disap-</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">peared, leaving moraines of earth and stones. The waters about Spitsbergen last summer were twenty-three degrees warmer than ever before known. (The coal mines of Spitzbergen, far above the arctic circle, are now producing coal for European markets.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Vast shoals of whitefish formerly found in the waters about Spitzbergen have gone to colder waters. Herrings and smelts, never before seen so far north, have come with the warmer waters. In some localities the Eskimos are complaining that their clothing is too warm for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Arctic ocean is a great basin, deepest at the pole. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the Japan Current are flowing into the basin north of Norway and through Bering Strait; and the cold water is flowing out of the basin on both sides of Greenland, down past Labrador, and back into the Atlantic at the east of Newfoundland. Explorers report from various points that the edge of the Arctic ocean has of late been remarkably free from ice, and it is evident the whole ocean is warming up. The waters of the Arctic ocean are extremely pure, shells being distinctly visible at great depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The actual shrinkage of the ice-belt in the Arctic is estimated as one hundred and thirty miles in twenty-five years. Thousands of observations, taken all over the northern part of the world, show that the whole climate, winter and summer, is one and three-tenths degrees warmer now than in 1897. The Swiss, Alaskan, and Himalayan glaciers are also shrinking, as well as those of Greenland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The coldest part of the north is not at the north pole. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the central polar sea was sixty-three degrees below zero, while it has been seventy degrees below at points in North Dakota and nearly that in New York state. The greatest cold ever actually recognized on a thermometer was ninety-three degrees below zero, at Verkhoyansk, Siberia.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font13">When within about one hundred miles of the pole Peary turned back Captain Barrett, of Newfoundland. For this act a swift retribution, followed. Another party, Dr. Frederick Cook, reaching civilization two weeks ahead of Pearys boldly announced that he had reached the pole by a lone one-man dash. This man, cornerej-by reporters, hired two old sea-captains t®. manufacture evidence for him. But he failed to pay them promptly, and they exposed his whole plan. Dr. Cook succeeded for a time in deceiving the Danish Government, and virtually the whole world. Peary died broken-hearted and unpopular; but there is no doubt that he really accomplished what thus far no other man has achieved. A statue at Washington has recently been unveiled in his honor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font13">NE of the most ambitious and successful of all arctic and antarctic explorers is Captain Roald Amundsen. In 1903-1906 he sailed a vessel through the famous Northwest Passage from the south of Greenland to Nome, Alaska, a trip made for the first time by McClure in 1850-1853. On this trip he revisited the magnetic pole, 1,400 miles north of Winnipeg and 1,200 miles south of the north pole, discovered by Parry in 1820.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1910-1912 Captain Amundsen sailed in the “Fram” (the ship made famous by Nansen in his arctic expedition of 1895), went down to the antarctic, sailed clear around the antarctic continent, landed on the edge of Ross Sea, and made a sudden dash for the south pole, which he reached on December 14,1911, a month ahead of the ill-fated Scott expedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1918, following the route opened up by Nordenskiold in 1878-1879, Captain Amundsen traversed the Northeast Passage from the northern part of Norway to Nome, Alaska, where his ship, the Maude, arrived in 1920. Thus he has the unique distinction of having circumnavigated the antarctic continent and the arctic ocean, as well as having been the first to visit the south pole. It would seem that this would be sufficient to suit the ambitions of any man, but a look at his picture explains it all. He has the eagle-shaped nose that turns back at no obstacle and that is out to win or die!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The task that is now engaging Captain ‘Amundsen’s time and energies is the preparation for a flight by aeroplane from Point Barrow, Alaska, via the north pole, to West Spitz-bergen. This expedition is financed by the Norwegian Government. He has taken two planes with him; the flight, 1,950 miles, will begin some time this season. Experienced aviators and explorers think he has about one chance in six of escaping with his life, on account of the heavy fogs which hover above stretches of water at a low altitude, the roughness of the ice for landing purposes, and the A length of the flight. However, Amundsen is a careful man, always studying arrangements for . &gt;&nbsp;supplies far ahead; he may possibly succeed. v</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Meantime, the arctic is warming up more </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">'s </span><span class="font13">and more every year, wireless has made communication easy, the Northwest Passage has &nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

Even now, if the necks of Melville and Boothia peninsulas were canalized,. ■ there would be almost a straight channel from t Hudson Strait to the north shore of Alaska; ~ and by the time the canals could be cut, the ' route could probably be used every summer for trade between England and North Pacific ocean 7 points, cutting down the present journey by ; several thousand miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stefansson the Enthusiastic</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">AN </span><span class="font13">ENTHUSIAST respecting the countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">that lie to the north of the Canadian mainland is the explorer Vilhjalmar Stefansson, ' sent out in 1908 and again in 1913 by the Cana- i dian Government. The last time he went out, he was gone five years; and when he returned <sup>; </sup>came back with maps of 100,000 square miles of land and sea hitherto marked “Unknown” on the maps. One of his discoveries was an island . almost as large as England that other explorers j had overlooked in their wanderings to and fro « over the top of the world. This island, Wrangell Island, seems to be well named; for when Ste-fansson returned, claiming the island on behalf of the British Empire, American government officials claimed the same island on the ground that it was taken possession of by American A official explorers in 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mr. Stefansson declares that the arctic re- 5 gions are in reality a boundless stock range, &quot;5 capable of raising herds that will feed the world. This stock—the reindeer, caribou, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and . </span><span class="font13">musk ox—finds abundance of food on the tundras, or between them, and needs neither bams sg nor haystacks. He demonstrated his faith </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font13">£3 his works, his expedition having lived off the country, instead of taking along enough food ;f| to last until his return to the base from which - 3 he started. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to the snowfall, Mr. Stefansson states that in the northern part of Alaska and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada -Ji </span><span class="font13">along the edge of the Arctic ocean, the snowfall is so light that if one scattered one hundred walnuts on the ground in the autumn one would be able to count ninety of them sticking out of the snow at any time during the winter. This being the'case, if the Eskimos living in those parts really want to see some snow, they had better come down into the United States. During this last winter we have had five months of sleighing in New York state and parts of Pennsylvania, with the snow over the tops of the fences in many places. On April 1st, 1923, at Rome, N. Y., the temperature was eight degrees below zero. Some sixteen years ago, at Tamarack, in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, there was a snowfall of seventy-four feet. But nobody w’ishes the Eskimos such hard luck as to have to face’ sueh a snowstorm as that. Maybe they could not endure it. The reason why the Californians stand it is because they must.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to the weather, Mr. Stefansson says that in the Klondike gold rush more prospectors died of summer sunstroke at Dawson than perished of winter cold; and that the coldest temperature ever recorded at Point Barrow, the northernmost point of Alaska, is fourteen degrees less than has been recorded at Havre, Montana, on the main line of the Great Northern Railway. He thinks the American School Geography the most widely read bit of fiction in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to natural resources, Mr. Stefansson says that he found fertile valleys filled with all sorts of life at points far above the arctic circle. He mentions that on Banks Island, four hundred miles north of the arctic circle, he counted 250 specimens of vegetation; and that on the northern shore of Alaska, 200 miles north of the arctic circle, there were 750 specimens of vegetation, with a summer temperature occasionally running higher than 100 in the shade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mr. Stefansson reports discoveries of coal, oil, etc.; and on his return to Vancouver, B. C., incorporated in that city an Exploration and Development Company which will endeavor to realize on some of his discoveries. He thinks that within a decade or two the whole northern territory will be crossed and recrossed by a network of aviation routes, that great numbers of little-known and supposedly uninhabited islands will become the homes of prosperous, contented, and happy men and women.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">But Captain MacMillan carried on for </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font13">months an uninterrupted observation of terrestrial magnetism, took meteorological and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">tidal J </span><span class="font13">observations, counted 121 days of sunlight </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">thirteen days of moonlight north of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">arctic </span><span class="font13">circle, and reported 770 varieties of flow<sup>T</sup>ers </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">the same latitude.

<p><span class="font13">Captain MacMillan found in Labrador the same terrible conditions among the Eskimos aa we have mentioned in a recent article on Alaska.

In </span><span class="font13">some towns there were survivors; in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">others </span><span class="font13">not one person remained alive.

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Greenland—Iceland—Norway</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HESE three countries are all connected, in the sense that they were settled by persons who speak the Danish language, descendants of the oldWikings. Greenland is oddly named; the largest island in the world (ten times larger than the State of Pennsylvania), granite in formation, it is covered with an ice-cap hundreds of feet deep, deposited at the time of the flood. (In summer Greenland does get green on the edges, in certain places.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We know that Greenland’s ice-cap came suddenly; for there have been dug up there the fossil remains of palms, breadfruit trees, cinnamon trees, giant sequoias, climbing vines, poplars, willows, eucalyptus, and magnolias, showing that there was once a tropical climate where now is located one of the world’s greatest refrigerators. Near the eastern shore of Advent Bay, Greenland, there are coal deposits of great extent and superior quality. From its vast ice' sheet come the icebergs that float down into Baffin Bay and Davis Strait every spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This year, on account of the rapid warming of the Arctic ocean by the Gulf Stream, the Greenland climate has been the warmest known; and as early as the middle of March more bergs had broken loose and come sailing down into the track of Atlantic ocean-liners than have been known in any year since the Titanic went down in the spring of 1912, with a loss of 1,500 lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the summer of 1922, in the thawing out of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">mass of ice on the eastern coast of Greenland, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">man was found, clad in armor of the eighth or ninth century, grasping a spear in one hand . and a shield in the other, and wearing a helmet. The body, which had doubtless been preserved in the ice for at least a thousand years, was </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">embalmed </span><span class="font13">and taken to Copenhagen, Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Iceland is also misnamed. Although it touches the arctic circle it has a warm, pleasant climate in summer, and is a healthful place of residency the year around. Europeans are finding it a pleasant summer resort and are visiting i,t in increasing numbers every year. The climate at sea level is about the same as that of Scotland. In some winter seasons the temperature at sea . level never falls to zero; and it is fifteen degrees below zero at New York city more fre- . 'I quently than it is at Reykjavik, the capital of y Iceland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are but two places in the world where f railways run to points north of the arctic circle. / One of these is a line which runs from a point t on the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden to Afoten i fiord on the coast of Norway, a tourist line in : the summer and an ore line all the year. The t engineer blows his whistle as the train crosses A the arctic circle. The second line is about seven hundred miles long, straight north from Petrograd to Kola on the Arctic ocean; the last two hundred miles of this distance is north of the arctic circle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font13">THIS subhead should logically be “Siberia,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Alaska and Canada”; but having so recently &gt;&nbsp;discussed Alaska it cannot be treated here, more A than to say that there is now in operation in I Alaska, within 175 miles of the arctic circle, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">flour mill which supplies local needs and obtains ■; its wheat from crops grown in the neighborhood, crops which mature in ninety days from ; the time they arc planted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Siberia, coldest spot in the north, is gradually thawing out. An interesting proof that this is so is that of the mammoth, uncovered near Khabarovsk, with flesh so fresh and well-preserved that the natives ate it. This flesh had remained frozen solid since the days of Noah, when the great snowstorm overtook the giant creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The soil in the vicinity of Toronto, Canada, shows the gradual warming up of the northern <sub>: </sub>regions since the flood. Several feet down thdre ; are the stumps of tropical trees, osage oranges, and pawpaws; above are the bones of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">musk </span><span class="font13">oxen, now found a thousand miles to the north. &gt;&nbsp;Northern Canada will yet be a great treasure 1 house. Without doubt it has great coal and oil J deposits in addition to those already </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">discovered </span><span class="font13">/&gt;j at Fort Norman and elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' «</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Fort Norman is far down the Mackenzie river, in latitude 65 degrees north, very near to the arctic circle. Reports of oil discoveries there have caused a rush in that direction, with prospects of an air service to help out the transportation, now confined to many hundreds of miles navigation by slow river boats. Fort Norman is at the outlet of the Great Bear Lake. Look it up in the old geography.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Reports have several times drifted in to civilization of the discovery, somewhere to the west of Fort Norman, of a valley four miles wide fed by hot springs, which has a summer climate the year around. This valley it is claimed is very fertile and is swarming with geese, caribou, deer, and pheasants. Its development has been retarded by the World War, but is now about to be undertaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before the flood there was timber all over the northern end of the world. Forests of fossil trees, with the stumps still standing, have been found in areas where now there is no timber, showing the great change which the flood produced. In the treeless areas there is tundra everywhere, a species of reindeer moss capable of supporting millions of these hardy creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The plants peculiar to the frigid zone have roots which are as long and penetrate as far horizontally as in more temperate climates, but the dry winter winds stunt the limbs. In summer the surface thaws out to the depth of two or three feet, but beneath is said to be frozen to a depth of two hundred to three hundred feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of flesh foods in the far north fat reindeer is said to be the best. Next to the fat reindeer is the wolf, whose meat is lean, streaked with fat and has the flavor of fine lamb. There are many kinds of fish-eating animals and birds in the arctic regions. The polar bear may truthfully be said to make his living more on the sea than on the land.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Notes on the Eskimos</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">S</span><span class="font13">CATTERED the most widely of any peoples, and living in a climate which varies from intense cold in winter to intense heat in summer, the Eskimos manage to make the best of their environment. In the period of midwinter darkness they take long journeys to visit their friends, and on arrival have a good time singing, dancing, and story-telling. It is said that an Eskimo laughs as much in a month as a white man does in a year. In the summer the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">long sunlight periods take away all sense ofi -j time; and the people eat when they are </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">hungry -</span><span class="font13">and sleep when they wish, without reference </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font13">what elsewhere are the hours of the night. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Eskimos are said to be fragrant, espe- r cially in the summer time, but it is claimed </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font13">this fragrance is not exactly that of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">new-mown \ </span><span class="font13">hay. The reason may be that the only use </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the -</span><span class="font13">Eskimos make of water is for drinking </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">pur- « </span><span class="font13">poses, it never seeming to have occurred </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to * </span><span class="font13">them that water would be as good for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">out- * </span><span class="font13">side of their bodies as for the inside. This </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">is ' </span><span class="font13">not true of all Eskimo tribes, however; in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">some <sup>f </sup></span><span class="font13">districts they are now beginning to use soap </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">v small quantities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The food of the Eskimos is almost entirely ; flesh food. In the north of Greenland the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">diet ’ </span><span class="font13">has been exclusively meat for at least a thou- j sand years. About fifty percent of the food ha* &quot;3 been eaten raw, and much of it in a putrid condition.

During the influ- A enza epidemic, far down each trail a man </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">jJ stationed with a gun, who turned back every ” man, whether white or Eskimo, who tried to j enter the country, and thus kept the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">disease </span><span class="font13">from invading the north coast. These </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">north </span><span class="font13">N; coast Eskimos have been under the influence of •=, Protestant missionaries; they are </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">considered </span><span class="font13">’-J brave and trustworthy.

<p><span class="font13">According to “The New Standard Dictionary,’’ Robert E. Peary in &quot;The North Pole,” page 49, gives the following bit of information regarding the origin of the Eskimos:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“There is a theory, first advanced by Sir Clements Markham . . . that the Eskimos are the remnants of an ancient Siberian tribe, the Onkilon . . . driven out . . . by the fierce waves of Tartar invasion in the Middle Ages. ... I am inclined to believe in the truth of this theory for the following reasons: Some of the Eskimos are of a distinctly Mongolian type, and they display many Oriental characteristics. . . . There is a strong resemblance between their stone houses and the ruins of the houses found in Siberia. As a general rule the Eskimos are short in stature, as are the Chinese and Japanese. . . . The women are short and plump. They all have powerful torsos, but their legs are rather slender.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Antarctic Exploration</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">M</span><span class="font13">UCH more attention has been paid to the arctic than to the antarctic because the explorers of both regions have chiefly come from the north temperate zone, because of the efforts to find a northwest passage, because there is human life to the very edges of the Arctic ocean, and because there is in the arctic a much greater variety of bird and animal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In a general way the top of the world is an ocean, and the bottom of the world is a continent. From whatever direction ships approach the south pole, they encounter flocs of pack ice, flat-topped, with perpendicular walls, and often measuring many miles in width and length, and are stopped finally by ice capped land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Access to the north pole was gained from the Atlantic ocean side of the pole, hut access to the south pole was gained from the Pacific side, and these seem to be the natural channels of approach. The Arctic ocean is open to the Atlantic and, except for Bering Strait, is closed to the Pacific. The Antarctic continent is at present seemingly unapproachable except from one direction; namely, from Ross Sea, which lies straight south of New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1773 Captain Cook sailed out of Cape Town, and within the next three years sailed around Antarctica, touching the continent at four points, three of them within the antarctic circle; but apparently he was unable to effect a landing anywhere. In 1842 Captain Ross, the discoverer of Ross Sea, sailed about three hundred miles along the face of the continental icewall, but at that time it was everywhere so high and steep that a landing was deemed impossible. Since then conditions have made landings possible, and it was from the opposite ends of this throe-hundred-mile journey that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">two •„ </span><span class="font13">successful expeditions to the south pole set </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">out. f </span><span class="font13">Serious attempts to reach the south pole </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">may ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">be said to have begun with Sir Ernest Shackleton’s expedition of 1907-1909, which reached within ninety-seven miles of the pole. Three magnificent efforts were his. He was with the ? successful but ill-fated Scott expedition in 1912; „ and he died and was buried on South Georgia : Island, the nearest approach to the antarctic continent on the Atlantic side, on his third exploration trip, at the close of the year 1921.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Amundsen and Scott</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font13">N HIS discovery of the south pole Captain Roald Amundsen came into Ross Sea from k the west, via the Cape of Good Hope, in 1910, and left for the east, via Cape Horn, in 1912. . He started out from Europe with the avowed intention of, if possible, beating Captain Scott in reaching the south pole, the announcement ■ of the latter's intended trip having been already ? made. It was thus a race for the south pole, <sub>; </sub>widely noted as such in the newspapers of the time. Captain Amundsen reached the south pole on December 14, .1911, remaining there four ; days. It is located on a plateau 10,260 feet above sea levo]. On the route from Ross Sea to and from the pole Captain Amundsen and party » v passed between two mountains each 16,000 feet in height, on a glacier which separated the two. On the way they experienced the terrible winds and bitterly cold weather for which the antarctic continent is famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Captain Scott's expedition was a success, in many respects a success of the highest kind; but he did not reach the pole until thirty days after Amundsen had departed. On his arrival at the pole he found the proof that Amundsen had been there. This was a very great disap- . pointment; for his expedition was even then &lt;&nbsp;short of fuel oil, a thing upon which the life of every man in the party depended. There were five in the Scott party of discovery; they were frozen to death one by one on the return, trip, their bodies being found by the searching party six months later under command of Captain Atkinson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The writer recently saw Captain Scott’s diary in the British Museum, the journal wherein </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font13">bravely but pathetically describes his disap- 'b pointment on reaching the pole, the deaths,</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">his companions, and finally the calm announcement that he, too, was about to freeze to death, his fuel having become exhausted and his hand no longer able to write because of the intense cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One of his party, showing the courage and the real greatness that marks the Scott trip as </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">success, when he knew that there was not fuel enough to provide for so many as the party contained, excused himself and deliberately &quot;went out for a walk” with the temperature some fifty or sixty degrees below zero, knowing when he started out that he was going out to freeze to death, but in the hope that thereby some of the rest of the party might be able to fight their way back to the ship. His body was found also. On their way to the pole the Scott party passed Mount Markham, 15,100 feet high.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Antarctic Continent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font13">T IS too early, by perhaps a hundred years or so, to give any description of the antarctic continent. The most that can be said about it is that its general outlines are now fairly well known. It is conjectured that Alexander Land, Victoria Land, Graham Land, Enderby Land, and other lands sighted by explorers, represent the borders of the continent; and that its area is approximately four million square miles, or about two thousand miles in diameter. The high mountain peaks and volcanoes, the names of several of which are known, and their heights measured, tend to establish the continental theory, although there are vast areas within the antarctic circle which have never been visited by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Climatic conditions there at present are extremely severe, although the ice is melting on each side of the continent at the rate of a mile </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">year; and when the Lord gets ready to turn some warm current against it, the rate of melting will be greatly increased. The antarctic continent will not be inhabited and developed </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font13">some time after the arctic regions, for the reason that its elevations are higher and that it has its winter at a time when the earth is three million miles farther from the sun than when it is winter at the north pole. The ice-covered land areas, the great ice-floes, and the heavy fogs all unite in producing extreme cold* Even in summer the mean temperature is slightly below freezing, so that, to all intents and purposes, there is now resting on the antarctic continent virtually all the snow that fell there at the time of the flood and that has fallen since. This must all melt before normal conditions will maintain, and may take several hundred years, or a hundred at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are no human beings in Antarctica; a very few explorers have ever survived a winter there. There are numerous varieties of whales, thirteen species of seals, eleven species of fish, most of them new to science, great numbers of penguins, and eight other kinds of birds, with some insects, mosses, lichens, and grasses. The existence of land animals is doubted, although it seems to be implied in dispatches from the Cope expedition, now in the antarctic, regarding furs. It may be that the furs referred to are sealskins. The Cope dispatches refer to discoveries of oils and minerals, all of which coincides with our knowledge that at the time of the flood the whole earth was rich in vegetation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">WO days were set aside for a visit to the north of Ireland. The trip was looked forward to with great interest, partly because at that time it was supposed to be unsafe. The ship from Liverpool to Belfast was supposed to sail at 10:00 p. m., and reach destination next morning; but it was held up by fog, and did not get out of the Mersey until 5: 00 a. in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“The Island of Sorrows” presented anything but a sorrowful appearance when the beautiful shores in the neighborhood of Donaghadee first came into view, about 1: 00 p. m. Though it was late in November, the hillsides were brilliantly green with the verdure for which the Emerald Isle is famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Ireland is more moist than Great Britain proper, and its temperature is still more moderate. Tn winter it rarely falls below 40 degrees</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Fahrenheit, and in summer the hottest is about 62. The gardens produce until Christmas. In Belfast, on November 17th, sweet peas were growing in profusion out of doors, as were also thousands of young lettuce plants, unprotected. Chrysanthemums also grow’ out of doors, and open plumbing is exposed ■without any fear of freezing. The frequent and prolonged rains or mists sometimes cause the loss of harvests. On account of the fact that the changes in temperature are not extreme, some boys and girls go barefooted late in the year, possibly all winter (but their feet did look blue with cold).</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Belfast the Militant</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font13">RELAND is a garden spot of the earth. It does have some bogs, and it does have some mountains; but for all that, it is estimated that about four-fifths of the island are tillable, being mostly a rich, deep loam. It is particularly beautiful in the neighborhood of Belfast, needing only the proper administration of proper law’s to convert it into a paradise. An item of interest to a stranger is to see the one-horse market carts, hundreds of them, all painted the same rich salmon color. Apparently the farmers make it a rule to keep their carts freshly painted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Residents of Belfast are grieved at the conditions which prevailed there last summer. They acknowledge that both Catholics and Pretestants are to blame for the reign of terror; and they are in fear of a recurrence of the murders, fires, and bombing outrages which were for weeks visited in swift succession, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">alter- </span><span class="font13">' 7 nately, by one side against the other.

J that same month sixteen of the citizens </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font13">u publicly flogged for carrying concealed weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The American was walking with a friend from the Post Office to the hall in which the lecture was to be given. It was shortly after dark; the rvay was down a rather dimly lighted street; &nbsp;&nbsp;h</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">half way down the block four men were stand- &nbsp;&nbsp;. &lt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">As the American approached the party, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font13">suddenly remembered that it is not considered k healthy to have your hands in your </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">pockets '~ </span><span class="font13">when walking through &amp;&nbsp;district that is under martial law. He removed his hands from his overcoat pockets; as he did so, the muzzle of one of the rifles instantly came down, merely to make sure. If there had been a weapon in the American’s hands, he would probably have been ■ turned into a colander in less than a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The next day the American was riding through the streets iu an automobile. The party overtook a squad of four soldiers patrolling one of the main thoroughfares in a motor lorry. There -were four pairs of sharp eyes scrutinizing everything within sight. The automobile overtook the lorry and passed it. The American had his hands crossed in his lap. One of the guns came down so as to make sure there was nothing hidden under the crossed hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font13">UR readers all know that Ulster is one of the storm centers of the world.

Chalked on a ■wall near the city in letters two feet high were the words, “No Surrender.” Asked what it meant, a citizen replied that it is Ulster’s battlecry; it will never surrender to Roman Catholic domination, no matter what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font13">lister people are aggressive and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">deter</span><span class="font13">mined in a manner and to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">degree not </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">found </span><span class="font13">and not required elsewhere.

<p><span class="font13">Tradition has it that the first invaders </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font13">Scotland agreed that whoever would be first ashore should be made king. As the beach was neared, a man of iron nerve drew his broadaxe, cut his left hand off and threw it ashore before any man could land. He was given the rulership which he coveted. The incident is characteristic of Ulster. If looking for trouble and in doubt where to find it, our advice is that you go to Ulster and try to start something.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A sample of Ulster’s nervous condition may be seen in the experiences of a Unitarian who was distributing tracts in Belfast, in October, in front of a Presbyterian church door. Now it happens that the Presbyterian church is the backbone of Protestantism in Ulster, and any attack upon its teachings is likely to be construed in the nature of an attack upon Protestantism, and therefore upon militant Ulster itself. Although the man stoutly denied that he had given provocation or made himself objectionable in any way he was knocked down, kicked while down, and seriously injured by those whom he was trying to reach with his message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the same city only a few weeks previously a group of armed men entered a cooper shop. Each employe was asked the simple question, “Catholic or Protestant?” Four answered “Protestant,” and were shot and killed instantly in their tracks. Every such attack was repaid by something in kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Winston Churchill, Colonial Secretary of the British Empire, charged that the disorders in Ulster w<sup>T</sup>ere due to the organization there of two divisions of the Irish Republican army and the continuous efforts of these men to break down the Ulster government and bring it under Dublin rule.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Ireland Being Destroyed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE perplexing and distressing political and religious problems of Ireland are destroying it. Even Belfast, the largest and most prosperous city, feels the strain to a great degree. Belfast has the largest linen mill in the wmrld, the largest shipyards (all the ships of the White Star line are built there), the largest tobacco factory, and in two other respects is said to stand at the front of the world’s cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But Ireland as a whole is on the down grade. In 1841 the population was 8,196,597. Seventy years later it was reduced to about half, or only 4,390,219. In 1860 there were twice as many boats and twice as many hands engaged in the fishing industries of Ireland as there were fifty years later. In 1868 there were 4,000 employed in the cotton industry; forty years later the number thus employed was but 800.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Where have all these people gone? Come over to America, and we will show you. They are here by the millions; and through their peculiar training in politics and religion, obtained in Ireland itself, they are running the country, even though greatly in the minority. It is estimated that the Irish population of the United States, including those with Irish grandparents and great-grandparents, is nearly double that of the mother country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The thing that has brought Ireland to where it is, is misrule-—the attempt to force the political and religious ideals of one people upon another. And in this instance the attempt at coercion was made upon a people that are singularly hard to coerce. Oddly enough, the natives of Ulster do not like the English; and still more oddly, they have no more use for Americans than they have for the English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is not generally known that as early as the sixth century Ireland was recognized as the seat of Western learning, from which missionaries of the Christian faith were sent out all over Europe. For three centuries thereafter the Irish were considered the wisest men in Europe. The Irish people know these things; they know that their kings were once wise and powerful men, and that the people were happy and contented, a thing they have not been since the only English pope, Adrian IV, sat on the Papal throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To be sure, Ireland had some troubles during those centuries. What country had not? But it was unusually free from the struggles in which the rest of Europe was embroiled. There was an invasion of Ireland by the Norwegians and Danes toward the close of the eighth century, but the Irish people absorbed their invaders— made Irishmen of them. The Norwegians </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">were . </span><span class="font13">distinguished as Findgaill (white strangers), .*3 and the Danes as Dubgaill (black strangers), names which survive in Fingall and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">MacDou- </span><span class="font13">'■•'&quot;S gall or MacDowell. The prefix &quot;Mac” </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">means </span><span class="font13">j “son of” and the prefix &quot;O” means &quot;grandson of.* 4</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Where the Trouble Began</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE troubles of Ireland began when Nicholas Breakspear of St. Albans, England, was elected to the popedom. He entered into a political deal with Henry II of England, whereby the latter was authorized to invade Ireland and take possession of it, although it was at the time a wholly Catholic country. The invasion itself took place in 1155; and there began the long period of confiscation of lands, and the attempt to wrest from an entire people their hereditary rights, w’hich has marked Ireland's history for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the reign of Edward III, 1327-1377 A. D., the Kilkenny Act was passed, forbidding intermarriage between English and Irish, forbidding the use of the Irish language, and forbidding the assumption of Irish names by persons of English blood. This Act inevitably led to great bitterness of feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At the beginning of the sixteenth century the greater part of the island still remained uncon-quered by the English; but in 1603 the work begun four hundred and fifty years earlier was completed, and within the next twenty-five years 1,400,000 acres of Irish land were taken away from their owners and distributed among English colonists. The hatred engendered by these robberies is in the blood of the Irish people to this day. One of the black spots of history is the rapacity and greed exercised by those in power, be they governments or individuals. A sense of justice for others in weaker stations of life has been sadly wanting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1649 the island revolted from British rule; and Cromwell, the lord lieutenant of the territory, with great cruelty subdued it in nine months. All the possessions of Catholics &quot;were confiscated, 20,000 Irish were sold as slaves in America and the West Indies, and 40,000 more found relief from slavery only by enlisting in the service of foreign rulers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Forty years later, in the reign of William III and his successor, laws were enacted making it a crime for Catholics to teach or to have their children taught by Catholics, or even to send them abroad where they would be educated in Catholic schools. These laws, which remained in force for a hundred years, resulted in great illiteracy among the Catholics and intensified their hatred of English rule.</span></p>

The natural result of these </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">unjust </span><span class="font13">practices and law's w'as that secret societies were formed and an underground method </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of ' </span><span class="font13">devising ways and means to get along was </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">put </span><span class="font13">into effect, which is ruining the country at </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font13">very day. During the American Revolution, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">from that time until now, the Irish have </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font13">allowed to own landed property, to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">erect </span><span class="font13">schools, and to observe their own religion. J</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With the progressive enlightenment of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">nineteenth and twentieth centuries the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">laws </span><span class="font13">affecting Ireland have become less rigorous </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in ’ </span><span class="font13">some respects; and yet some very unjust regulations have been made. For example, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">at the </span><span class="font13">behest of English woolen manufacturers </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a law </span><span class="font13">was passed forbidding the sale of Irish woolens abroad and their sale in England only upon </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the ' ’ </span><span class="font13">payment of an excessive duty. The direct </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ob</span><span class="font13">ject and effect of this law was the killing of -the Irish woolen trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The organic “union’’ of Ireland with </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">England ■ </span><span class="font13">w'as accomplished by chicanery. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">In the year </span><span class="font13">1800 a bribery fund of $8,000,000 was </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">used in </span><span class="font13">buying up the rotten boroughs which had </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">r majority of seats in the Irish House of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Com-</span><span class="font13">mens.

<p><span class="font13">In the year 1903 a great and earnest attempt w’as made to undo wrongs which had been per- / petuated for centuries. A fund of $500,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;--</span></p>

This law also required ; the absentee landlords to sell at a reasonable 1 price.

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Secret Government</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font13">ITH the close of the World War the campaign for self-determination of peoples which spread all over the world reached Ireland, also; and there was a revival of the government by secret societies which has prevailed to a greater or less extent throughout the centuries of British occupation. All of our readers are familiar with the Sinn Fein movement and the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A number of assassinations, laid at the door of the Sinn Fein, caused the British government in the summer of 1920 to make the fatal mistake of issuing instructions tantamount to granting the British troops then in Ireland leave to take the law into their own hands. The ' campaign of lawlessness thus begun has not ceased, even though British authority in Southern Ireland is a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The two years from the summer of 1920 to the summer of 1922 were terrible years in Ireland. The Irish people were fighting for liberty by the peculiar methods of ambush and assassination in which they have been trained by the conditions under which they have lived for hundreds of years. The money was supplied from America, where bonds to the amount of $9,000,000 for the formation of an Irish Republic were sold openly while America and England were at peace. At length the situation became so intolerable to the British Government that its policy of force was abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some time in the early summer Lloyd George summoned the Irish chieftains to London, and there entered into an agreement with the leader of the Irish army, Michael Collins, that Ireland should remain within the empire but be a free country like Canada. The matter was put to a vote of the Irish people, and by a large majority they approved the compact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But a branch of the secret government refused to approve the treaty or to be bound by it; and since then the Irish government has been forced to fight for its own existence against some of the men who helped bring it into being. Mr. De Valera, the original head of the proposed Irish Republic, is the leader of the irreconcilables. In the meantime, the situation has become complicated by the out-and-out recognition of the Collins government by the Papacy and the threat to send to hell all who adhere to De Valera.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>A Reign of Terror</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">M</span><span class="font13">R. DE VALERA and his friends have seemed determined to celebrate their proposed advent in hell by having an “'orthodox” one here in advance. In July men supposed to belong to his faction ambushed a funeral party, killing one man and imprisoning eight others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">About the same time they seized and destroyed the great wireless station at Clifdcn. It is not known what possible motive could have inspired such an act of vandalism. Shortly afterward the Kerry cable offices were raided, and the cables put out of commission. Near Tralee a -work train was captured, the crew was taken off, a full head of steam was turned on, and the train at sixty miles an hour was allowed to run until it dashed into a station and wrecked itself, and the station as well. This is not warfare; it is not patriotism; it does not show common sense; it is anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The new government has had a stormy time. Its president, Arthur Griffith, died on August 12th; and only ten days later Michael Collins, the military head of the nation, was ambushed and killed at Bandon, County Cork. Organized murders have been common. In the latter part of October three lads between sixteen and eighteen years of age were found riddled with bullets in a disused quarry outside of Dublin. The murdering of boys is not -war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Newspapers in some sections have been compelled to close down entirely, fearing to publish information of any kind. Emigration continues to take out of the country a people that dare not even use their own roads or &quot;work their own fields. Experience, capacity, industry, and ability have become discouraged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE Roman Catholic church seems to be losing its hold on Ireland. De Valera’s forces have been in open defiance of the Pope’s expressed wishes. In Dublin, in October, a company of one hundred Catholic women and girls hissed Cardinal Logue, Archbishop Byrne, and a score of other bishops at a reception at the Mansion House. Nothing of the kind ever happened before. At this writing, 'the church is using all its influence with De Valera and his followers to induce them to discontinue their campaign of brigandage and to accept the Collins government.

<p><span class="font13">possibility of its success. If successful, the church’s hold upon the people will likely be strengthened; but if the De Valera campaign goes on and gains headway and finally overturns the government, the church will be in a bad way indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1901 the religious census of Ireland was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Roman Catholics..................—..........3,310,028</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Protestant Episcopal ------------------------------ 57 9,385</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Presbyterians .......... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;443.494</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Jews ............ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,7 69</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the six counties that go to make up the present Ulster government it is estimated that out of a total population of 1,250,000 the total number of Roman Catholics is 407,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Wherever the Roman Catholic church has a foothold, it lays claim to great power over those who remain in subjection to it. An illustration was furnished recently in Liverpool: The Reverend J. I. McKinley, a Roman Catholic priest of that city, upon receiving from his parishioners a gift of 500 guineas ($2,500) in cash, a set of cloth-of-gold vestments, a gold watch and a gold cross, made the statement, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font13"> used to tell the police during riots that with one little finger we could control more than they could with all their forces.” Apparently he thought that the rioters were nearly all Catholics; possibly so.</span></p>

His wonder increased when he found that two packages which </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">friend had carried aboard for him did not have the label. He inquired of the ship steward, and was informed that there was no cause for anxiety, that the pasting of the ugly labels means nothing at all, not one thing. It merely provides a job for one of Uncle Sam’s political henchmen; but it brings the country into contempt. Probably if the matter is looked up, it will be found that that label-paster gets a fine salary, his whole duty consisting of smearing labels on baggage which would look much better</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">The return journey, second class, afforded an opportunity to get acquainted with some </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">very .. | </span><span class="font13">fine people. One of these, an unusually witty ? and widely-read native of Manchester, England, -j will be long remembered. Acknowledging that. ? his countrymen, like Americans, are often mis- t understood, he quoted from some scamp of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">an . </span><span class="font13">author who has unjustly said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Everybody loves an Irishman, but nobody respecta , him; everybody respects a Scotchman, but nobody loves 7 him ; and when, you find somebody that nobody either ; loves or respects, mark him well. He is an Englishman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Just before the boat cast off into the Mersey 7 an aviator, advertising a popular magazine, . performed the splendid feat of writing </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the ■ </span><span class="font13">name of the magazine in letters hundreds </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">feet high across the face of the sky.

<p><span class="font13">exceedingly well written, in fact. All the letters • \ of the word “Answers” were perfectly </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The day before the boat reached New </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">York a ' </span><span class="font13">splendid specimen of whale was leaping </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and -■ </span><span class="font13">rushing around in the ocean about </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">mile </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">away^ </span><span class="font13">being plainly visible for several minutes. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">On * </span><span class="font13">some of his leaps he showed fully two-thirds </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of . </span><span class="font13">his length out of the water; and as whales </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">grow </span><span class="font13">to be sixty to seventy-five feet long, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and this </span><span class="font13">was evidently of full size, it was a sight </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">worth j </span><span class="font13">seeing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Shortly before arrival at New York there </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font13">an entertainment given by the passengers, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">proceeds of which go to the seamen’s fund. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font13">star singer, a young Scotchman, did very </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">well </span><span class="font13">with his first part on the program. When </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">time came for his second appearance, he </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font13">not be found at first. Finally he was located </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">the barroom, where he had gone to gather more courage. The result was a scream. He sang, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font13">stood on the bridge at midnight”; but you </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">knew </span><span class="font13">instinctively that if he did, it was only because he was hanging on to something. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ship </span><span class="font13">swayed, but the singer swayed more. The audience began to laugh softly; and the maudlin singer began to weep. But he kept on singing with a time and a tune all his own.

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Four Interesting Cities</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE day's news discloses four interesting cities; Vienna, New York, Washington, and Santa Rosa, California. Probably there are others, but not for the purpose of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Vienna is interesting because Walter Finkler, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">young student in the Biological Experimental Institute, succeeded in removing the heads of Hydrophilus and Dytiscus beetles and grafting the heads of Hydrophilus upon the bodies of Dytiscus and vice versa; and because some of the beetles were left headless and lived in that condition for three or four days. Beetles Hydrophilus which had been provided with Dytiscus heads no longer swam, as good Hydrophilus beetles were made to do, but went through the water with a treading motion, showing that a land beetle’s head is no good on a water beetle’s body. We might have known that, anyway. Female beetles provided with male heads began courting normal females. This seems to show that the real reason why males court females is because their heads are not right. Or does it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The same article reports living eyes successfully grafted upon rats, toads, and fish, previously made blind. This seems, in part, like a fish story, but is vouched for by E. G. Boulen-ger, at an address before the London Zoological Society, reported in the London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph.</span><span class="font13"> Having stood sponsor for London prob</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ity, </span><span class="font13">the question that now troubles us is as to whether in some way the reporter of the Belfast item on page 468 has found a place on the staff of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph.—</span><span class="font13">1 Timothy 5: 20.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>New York Idolatry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">N</span><span class="font13">EW YORK is interesting because the Reverend Doctor William Norman Guthrie, pastor of the Episcopal church of St. Mark’s-in-the-Bouwerie, has just held a public service, not in praise and honor of the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, but in worship of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The following is part of this remarkable service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Hail to thee, beautiful God of every day I Beautiful is thy arising in the horizon of the sky. Beautiful is thine arising, 0 living Aten, Orb of light, O first beginning of life! When thou arisest in the eastern horizon thou fillest every land with thy beauty. Thou art beautiful to behold, great glistening high above the earth; thou art Ra, the Sun-God, and thou earnest all away captive. Thou kindest them fast with thy love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then there was </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">prayer to , the sun-god, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">which he was addressed as “Amen-Ba, Lord </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the thrones of the earth, Ancient of Days, Up-stayer of things that are, Foremost of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Gods, </span><span class="font13">Lord of truth and righteousness, Begetter </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the Gods, Maker of men and beasts and herbs.” ' Then a lady read from “The Gospel of Osiris” an account of the doings of Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Horus, as the same are recorded more </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">at$ </span><span class="font13">length in the article entitled “Mythology and the Bible” which appeared in The Golden Age, Numbers 43 and 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Doctor Guthrie explained that his object in drawing “upon.the past treasures of spiritual experience” was to show their &quot;harmony with our own religion,” and then says: &quot;Their confessions of faith were in many ways very similar to ours.” The Doctor was right in all this. Those old fellow<sup>T</sup>s in the long ago worshiped </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">devil outright, as the article in The Golden Age abundantly proves; and it -is as well that the Doctor and all the ecclesiastical organizations designed and built according to plans </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">specifications furnished by the devil should come out openly and admit that they are idolaters, pure and simple, without God and having no hope in the world. There is no place for the Lord Jesus Christ in all this nonsense. Neither He nor the apostles nor prophets nor anybody else in the Bible, except idolaters, worshiped the sun in any way. The Doctor would </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be ' </span><span class="font13">strong for the trinity, oh, yes. Without doubt he thinks that Jesus was on the cross and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">waa </span><span class="font13">the sun up in the sky, ninety-two million miles away, at the same time. But why dally with such gibberish? It is of interest only as the prattling of infants or the incoherent jargon of imbeciles. It shows pretty well, however, what the so-called “churches” have become since they helped to pull off the stunt of making the world safe for democracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font13">ASHINGTON is interesting because it is the habitat of America’s wisest men. On the night of March 14th, 1923, there was a joint meeting of the Washington Academy of Sciences, the Biological Society of Washington, and the Botanical Society of Washington at the Interior Department. There were scientists present from the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Carnegie Institution, and the Johns Hopkins University. They were examining some specimens of the Pleistocene epoch dug out from an excavation in the vicinity; and although they were in some doubt whether the specimens were 20,000 years old or 200,000 years old, they had finally agreed that they were 30,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This was all very well until a disturber of the peace, a very aged man, arose and said that he knew the exact spot where the flora had been Uncovered, for there used to be a small creek running through the spot in which he and other Washington lads used to bathe, fish and hunt; and that he was quite positive that the 30,000-year-old specimens were in the immediate neighborhood of 29,930 years younger than they were supposed to be. And this is all for Washington scientists at this time.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Santa Rosa Timber</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">S</span><span class="font13">ANTA </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSA, </span><span class="font13">California, is interesting, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font13">because it is the home of Luther Burbank, the plant wizard, for Mr. Burbank has fallen very much in our estimation since he came out as a confessed atheist, but because in that place Mr. Burbank has, by means of crossings, improvements and selections, been able to produce a walnut tree which not only yields good walnuts but, more important still, grows walnut timber ten times as fast as any walnut heretofore known.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">rT'O </span><span class="font13">BE zealous for Christ does not mean activity in persecuting those of other Christian beliefs, but it does mean energetic loyalty in representing Christ as seen in the fruits and graces of the holy spirit. The statement has been made that the friends of Christ are Christianity’s greatest enemies. The truth of this statement is being hurled into the teeth of Christians—Christians in name only. In St. Louis, Frederick S. Fleming said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The great danger in this dangerous age to the cause </span><span class="font13">of </span><span class="font12">Christianity comes not from men who are not Christians, but from, the very ones who arc in the camp of Christ. A weak-kneed man often causes more trouble than a wicked man; and the Christian who is lukewarm </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font12">half-hearted is a stumbling block in the progress of the church,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But he missed the mark widely, and shows</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">that he, too, knows neither the Scriptures </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font13">the power of God, by saying, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“We must come square on our life job, and know </span><span class="font13">that </span><span class="font12">God is master in His own house, which is the world. We must know that God is always in the world controlling it with His immanence, and that our Christian prejudice is part of His plan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With that thought in mind there is not</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hing</span><span class="font13"> ■ for Dr. Fleming to do but go out and compel the world to be sectarian—to compass sea and land to make proselytes, and when they are made to have them worse off spiritually than they were before. (Matthew 23:15) He does „■ not see that the “god of this world” is Satan (2 Corinthians 4:4), and that Christ is the • Head of a house of sons who are not of the '* world, and that there are other “sheep” besides the church of this Gospel age which are also </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to * </span><span class="font13">be brought into the fold.—John 10:</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font13">NE of the great burdens, and one of the menacing problems, is the transportation question and the excessive freight charges, Which are throwing the entire machinery of our economic system out of plumb. Whether this is caused by the deliberate cunning of the financiers or is the outgrowth of a system which is top-heavy and which is proving itself inadequate for present business needs, or whether the whole is based upon a false premise, we do not know. We incline to the belief that all of these are factors which should be taken into account by the physicians of industry. But these being financial theorists who are selfishly lining their own pockets, it is useless for us to expect any cure from this quarter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A high and respected authority, Air. Theo. H. Price, ex-member of the United States Railroad A</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">dmi</span><span class="font13">nistration, recently made an address, from which we gather the thoughts contained in the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From his observation and from visiting many business men in the Northwest he found these men agreed that the serious domestic problem was the railroad problem — the high cost of transportation and the difficulty of getting freight moved with promptitude. The farmers are suffering because they cannot get their crops marketed; and when they do, the ruinous freight rates make it unprofitable to ship. The merchants are hampered by delays in deliveries of goods bought and sold, and freight rates are restricting them to comparatively narrow territory. In other words, both farmers and merchants have their capital tied up in undelivered goods. A Middle Western manufacturer cannot compete with an Eastern manufacturer in the East, nor can the Eastern firm compete with the Western firm in its own territory; but the Eastern company can sell cheaper on the Pacific coast than the Western company because the Eastern concern ships by water through the Panama Canal at less than one-half of the rail rate. Consequently, each manufacturer has things his own way in his respective territory.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Inevitable Coming to Pass</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">fPHE preacher business has been a good busi-ness—if we may be excused for reckless use of words. It is becoming quite noticeable that such expressions as “time-serving clergy” and “ease-loving preachers” are often used these days. The preacher business started early in ancient Babylonia. The “priests of Baal,” really the devil’s agents, have a very prominent place in the Scriptures. Baal was the sun-god, and was adored by the Moabites. God instituted in the nation of Israel a true priesthood, which served the divine purposes. The “priests” in other nations were imitations and counterfeits. In God's arrangement for both Israel and the church the number of priests is limited; they are confined to certain restrictions and qualifications. But in the devil’s arrangement the more “priests” the better. Any one with brains, a pious look and sanctimonious manner is good material for the preacher business. The theological seminaries “make” preachers not necessarily unlike the method by which the butcher grinds out his links of sausage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are firm believers in the fact that there are now in the earth a few persons who are disciples of Christ and have His spirit in them. These know God and His plan, and they teach the truth. There is also a much larger number who teach the doctrines of devils and the pre-cepts of men—theories uot founded on the Bible —not backed up by correlative subjects and inharmonious with the contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is for each to ascertain to his own satisfaction the line of demarcation between the good priests and the bad priests. As a hint to aid in arriving at an unerring conclusion: Search the New Testament for a distinction between the followers of the Lord Jesus, and give us the chapter and verse where we may find mentioned the two classes—clergy and laity. No one is to rule over and dominate any of the Lord’s disciples; those who do so are called Nicolaitanes in Revelation 2: 6, and the Lord’s opinion of them may be found in the same verse. A respect for the divine arrangement is a healthy state of the Christian’s mind, but none are commissioned to “lord it over” another or to use coercive measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We will quote some extracts from an article On “What’s Wrong with the Ministry?&quot; by a noted Bishop, in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic,</span><span class="font13"> with continents;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“During the last ten years, and especially since </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">war, a panic, has gone through the churches at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">de-, </span><span class="font12">crease in the number of candidates for the ministry, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">in the younger clergymen. ... Now that the ranks </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">the ministry have been thinned, there is great </span><span class="font13">danger </span><span class="font12">lest those in authority call in men of second and third class ability—pious, no doubt, but better suited to </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font12">mechanics and clerks than parsons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Evidently the thought conveyed here is that if a person is expert in handling a </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">screw-driver </span><span class="font13">or in weighing a pound of coffee he is disqualified for the preacher business. What does the Bishop mean by second and third class ability! Is it that only </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">first class </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font13">in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">preacher-</span><span class="font13">dom? But he admits that “a college degree </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">does </span><span class="font13">not make a big character.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“What the racked and bewildered world of </span><span class="font13">today </span><span class="font12">needs is leaders. The ministry needs them, too. And </span><span class="font13">the </span><span class="font12">question before the churches today is: How are </span><span class="font13">these </span><span class="font12">men to be found and equipped?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is an impossibility to find and equip them? for there are none. Satan’s organization </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font13">been exercising itself practically without </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font13">straints. Its fruit has ripened, and the results— war, famine, revolution, corruption, crime, loos® morals, and selfishness — abound. We </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font13">reached the end of the age, God’s protecting hand has been raised, and the contending force® are permitted to batter the bulwarks of society until the whole scheme of civilization crumbles into the dust! Out of the ruins towers the kingdom of God, so long prayed for. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The great </span><span class="font13">trouble has been that the people had too </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">much </span><span class="font13">reverence for the “divine right of kings” </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">the “divine right of the clergy,” while there </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font13">been no such thing, Satan rules by usurpation, and the “overseers” he has set up rule the same way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">G</span><span class="font13">OD had a. typical kingdom in Israel. Zede-kiah, the last king, was dethroned; and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">him the Prophet said: “Remove the diadem, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font13">take off the crown; this shall not be the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">same, </span><span class="font13">. . .

<p><span class="font13">That the preachers do not know these things is proof to us that they have been disconnected, telephonically speaking, from the great central station of Almighty God. “Babylon is fallen, is fallen”—churchianity is rejected, is rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That the theological seminaries are unreliable the Bishop admits:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“It is patent to all that the theological seminaries have in the past been too free in admitting young men to membership and that some Bishops and others who have had the responsibility of commending them have been too Lenient in passing almost any pious, well-meaning young man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This is a vain attempt to shift the responsibility from the “leaders” to the lack of calibre of the young men seeking the preacher business. The Bishop does not shift it entirely; for he says: &quot;One other reason for the lack of sufficient leaders in the ministry is faulty methods of selecting candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are confident that this work is done by the power of Satan; for God never commissioned any one to select candidates for Him. Jesus said: &quot;No man can come to me, except the Father which sent me draw him.” (John 6: 44) If Jesus had not the power to say: “I will be God’s priest,” without being invited by God through the power of the holy spirit, what right has any man to &quot;make” Christians, to say nothing of making them expositors of the Word! Jesus was sent by God into the world to save the world from sin and death, and He took no honor to Himself to be made something to which He was not called. (Hebrews 5: 4, 5) The disciples were commissioned to witness to the world, and not to convert the world; the conversion of the world awaits the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. Those who “make” or “grind out” converts irrespective of the leading of the holy spirit only make them worse—by deceiving them and giving them false standards </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">righteousness.—Matthew 23:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bishop says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“It is not the fault of the people that they are ignor</span><span class="font13">ant, </span><span class="font12">but the fault of the Church and of the clergy themselves that they have not taken, the trouble to tell the story, and in such a way as to get it under the skin of the young men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A frank admission, indeed, if true. But the church referred to is the church nominal; and its clergy have not known the story to tell—</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">-they </span><span class="font13">know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. To get the message under the skin needs the old hell-fire and brimstone theology, the hard-hearted doctrine of election, the badness of God, and the awfulness of the judgment day I These all are the devil’s doctrines. Satan incites through fear, always. Hold up the bogy man, preach a scare-crow religion; and you’ll get it “under the skin.” The only method or manner in which God draws disciples to Christ </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font13">through love. There is a freedom, a liberty, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">peace of mind, a reasonableness in the doctrine of love not found anywhere outside of the Bible. God is love; His message is one of “good tidings unto all people”; His messengers are kind, liberty-loving. They hate no one, are forbearing and tolerant; but they do have righteous indignation against error and sham religions posing as Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Here is one type of preacher the Bishop </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">la</span><span class="font13">ments over:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The other young man has never known doubt, </span><span class="font13">or </span><span class="font12">questioned; he accepted his mother’s theology, and </span><span class="font13">later </span><span class="font12">his Sunday School teacher’s theology, and his minister’s. He is docile, pious, but without force of mind or </span><span class="font13">charac</span><span class="font12">ter. He is found to be orthodox; he always will </span><span class="font13">be </span><span class="font12">orthodox. He is passed by the examiner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What is his fault? He lacks force of mind; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font13"> he is not dynamic, he lacks coercive power, he is not hypnotic—his congregation goes to sleep, the shingles fly off the roof of the church, and the nickels fail to jingle in the collection basket! Ah, some tale of woe, this! What </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">shame that God has not given us a Billy Sunday for every thousand of our inhabitants!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">street think of ministers; and he found out. . : . Here is what they say about the Church: </span><span class="font13">“The </span><span class="font12">ministers </span><span class="font13">are </span><span class="font12">clever at sliding through; they don’t believe </span><span class="font13">what they </span><span class="font12">say.’ Says a tradesman’s wife: ’They keep telling.</span><span class="font13">you </span><span class="font12">what you mustn’t do; that you can’t do this and that— play cards, go to the theater. They talk about charity and won’t give a man a cent or a job. I had enough of them when I was a girl.’ ‘Ministers aren’t interesting,’ </span><span class="font13">adds </span><span class="font12">an automobile man, ‘everything they tell me I know already. The minister never comes into my shop to see me; and </span><span class="font13">I </span><span class="font12">am glad of it.’ ‘Ministers are fakers,’ says </span><span class="font13">a </span><span class="font12">Syrian shoemaker. </span><span class="font13">A </span><span class="font12">manager of the machine </span><span class="font13">works </span><span class="font12">does not hesitate to say: ‘Ninety-nine percent of </span><span class="font13">the </span><span class="font12">ministers are wishy-washy. They are preaching </span><span class="font13">for </span><span class="font12">money.’ The director of an economic foundation expressed his sentiments: ‘Ministers, especially Episcopal ministers, don’t give me anything in their sermons; they fall back on stock phrases; they don’t define terms, but just keep on talking. They talk on the price of coal or industrial and economic conditions which they don’t know anything about.’ A medical student adds: ‘Ministers aren’t modern; they lack moral courage to speak the truth’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bishop gives the theological “cemeteries” away in the following story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Here then is the chance for the ministers; here is the opportunity for the churches and especially for the theological seminaries. A layman said to me a while ago: ‘Our minister is quite a scholar; he is as dry as dust as a preacher; he is no pastor. The children run away from him, and he is seared of them; he would make an excellent professor in a theological seminary.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are wondering where this preacher’s alibi will come in. Perhaps he expects leniency for exposing the gang, or for patting contracted words into the mouths of those less learned than </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font13">self. He laments the condition of the “Church of Christ,” and hopes that these days of her delinquency will soon pass. Let him know that the Church of Christ is not visible to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HAT “Christendom,” meaning Christ's kingdom, as applied to the present time, is an unjustifiable use of the yvord is evidenced in a recent speech of Dr. At. F. Burns of Few York, before the Council of Cities of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Cleveland. “The more systematically and scientifically we investigate the present economic and industrial institutions of this country the more we are convinced that many of these institutions are non-Christian, some un-Christian, and a few are anti-Christian,” the Doctor is reported to have said. He proved his point by saying that he had a friend who had made a net profit in the last twelve months of $5,000,000. Upon inquiry he learned that his friend employed 15,000 women and girls who earned from $8 to $15 a week, and was not concerned whether they could live virtuously on that or not; that he was living well within the business ethics which the church has built up during the last 2,000 years. When asked the question what he would do if his minister should show him up in a sermon on Social Justice, he replied, smilingly: “I suppose naked eye; and that all the churches of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font13">kind which arc visible to the naked eye </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">are parts </span><span class="font13">of the “Synagogue of Satan”—are of him, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font13">his spirit (transformed), and teach his doctrines, and not the doctrines of Christ in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">theif </span><span class="font13">simplicity and truth.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Reports from Foreign Correspondents</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>- From England</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">rpHE Easter holiday season, always very wel-come to the English people, because it is the first break in work since the Christmas holidays, has been very much enjoyed. The railways report an exceptionally busy time, equaling in volume of traffic that of pre-war days. As the railway fares are still high and out of proportion to ordinary values, we may say that the railways did well to themselves. The weather was not unfavorable anywhere. Indeed, in the south of England it was sunny and warm; and the crowds, especially those who got to the seaside, had a very refreshing and enjoyable holiday. Those who find their chief excitement and enjoyment in watching the crack football players got what they wanted—except when their favorite club lost the game, and incidentally their friends<sup>3</sup> money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although there is much money being spent in pleasure, and the life of the great city seems almost luxurious, there is a good deal of quiet suffering; and very many people are living on the borders of the poverty line. Authentic information through a personal friend relative to miners’ wages in one district of South Wales is that even when working on full time the utmost a miner can earn is thirty-six shillings, or $8.50, per week. But it is almost impossible for a man to get a full week’s work, and the average would be three-fifths to three-fourths of that sum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At the present time there are several labor disputes going on. The East Anglia farmers and the farm laborers have a quarrel. The laborers have struck for a living wage. Also a builders quarrel is in progress, and 400,000 men are involved in it. In South Wales 40,000 miners in the Rhondda Valley are on strike over a union dispute; and there is apparently a well-settled purpose on the part of the members of the National Union of Railway Workers to resist the drop in wages intended by the railway companies as soon as present agreements lapse. These things, coupled with the slackness of general trade and the enormous loss of the European markets, keep commercial life at a low ebb, and tend to dishearten both capital and labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Though nowadays there is not so much looking and longing for the liberty, freedom, and success, which the Britisher has always asso-eiated with the great United States of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">America _ </span><span class="font13">—and that great country has heartened </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">many </span><span class="font13">broken sons of Europe into a new life—</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and --</span><span class="font13">though now the western continent does not </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">call </span><span class="font13">as once it did, many from here would like </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font13">enter into its life and its privileges of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">getting </span><span class="font13">on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The political world is </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">quiet at present, and </span><span class="font13">i there is nothing special doing amongst ecclesiastics. At this season of the year it is the custom in England for the religious organizations to hold their yearly meetings. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">We look </span><span class="font13">with interest to what the leaders </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">will have to , </span><span class="font13">say about the world situation as viewed from &gt;. their platforms. What they think </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">will be re</span><span class="font13">served for expression in other places.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>From Canada</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">HUIE political situation in Canada shows little ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">activity, the main points at issue being the ' signing of the “Halibut” treaty with the United ? States by Canadians, without recourse to the i. mother country. This is a step that is hailed by one party as being a definite advance toward complete nationhood, and by another as again proving the old contention that Canada does not need any longer to remain tied to the apron -strings of England, but can he the arbiter of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font13">own destiny without her capable guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The signing of the treaty revives the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">old </span><span class="font13">arguments about Secession, an issue that has ; received stimulus from the present deplorable condition of the Western fanner; and it is freely stated in certain sections that should the West again be faced with a Reciprocity issue, -the result would be a great deal different from the issue of the Laurier administration. Certain Western newspapers, prominently amongst them the Manitoba </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press,</span><span class="font13"> deprecate the ' possibility of any breaking away from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">East, </span><span class="font13">interpreting all such talk as a gesture on the part of the West to obtain consideration from the Eastern magnates. However, when one considers the tremendous number of American immigrants that make up the fanning communities of the Prairie Provinces, it is not hard to believe that, should the matter come to a definite vote, England would experience considerable difficulty in keeping the West within the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A news item in the Toronto </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font13"> of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">March </span><span class="font13">20th, headlines its report of the vote on decorations: “The man’s the man, remains standard for all Canadians. House of Commons, by huge majority, defeats Return to Decorations. No titles and ribbons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Canada is perhaps the first country in the world to refuse to accept titles or honors, when such are available. However, the recent revelations of the methods used in the bestowing of such honors at the hand of the King, and the “pork-barrel” tactics employed in the obtaining of them by profiteers who are prepared to contribute to the party funds at election time, do not add to the savoriness of such recognition of merit. Canada is well satisfied to be represented by plain “misters,” where such have a deep sense of the responsibility resting upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Prohibition problem remains as intricate as ever. The Saskatchewan Legislature was recently treated to some strong expressions of opinion with regard to the conditions extant in the Province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That the Prohibition enforcement is virtually at a standstill is a notorious fact. Everywhere the evidence accumulates that the law is being broken with impunity. It does not seem to enter the consciousness of our lawmakers that instead of attacking the bootlegger as the provider of the illicit whiskey, the more effective work would be done by framing a law that prevented the rich and influential consumer from providing a market for such liquor. If there w<sup>T</sup>as no demand, there would be no supply; and the “churches” which today pour wrath upon the head of the vendor might be better employed in putting a ban upon the members of the congregation who secretly (and in many cases not so secretly) lend their consent to lawbreaking by consuming the bootlegger’s product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font13"> editorial in the Toronto </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font13"> of March 23, with the heading “The Spring Migration,” provides some interesting reading in connection ■with the conditions in agricultural circles. It says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“There is a real emigration movement of agriculturists from the Prairie Provinces, which has been brought about by crop failures, a great reduction in the price received for cattle and cereals, and in certain of the newer settlements by lack of transportation facilities. Farmers who leave the country because of these or other adverse conditions are not likely to return very soon, and their departure is a loss that we do well to regard </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font12">serious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">More and more light is being thrown </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">on the </span><span class="font13">condition of the West; and the fact can </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font13">longer be disguised that a state of serious alarm is evident amongst the financial element, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font13">stand to lose a great deal of money through </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">curtailment of farm activity. Western Canada is losing a considerable percentage of its farming element. Considering that it is practically ninety percent dependent on the farmer for its prosperity, anything that interferes with </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font13">source of income is serious. More “Commissions” are being projected for further elaborate and costly investigations into the grain traffic, and at the time of writing the freight tariffs . have been under review.- That any good </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font13">result is hardly to be expected, in the face of past performance, as the policy of those moguls that hold the farmer in their grasp is a </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">case </span><span class="font13">of “what we have we hold.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">J. F. Woodsworth, Labor M. P. for Centre Winnipeg, speaking in London, Ont., recently said, according to the Toronto </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font13"> press report;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;It seems a strange state of affairs that, the ministerial alliance should be content with suppressing the sale </span><span class="font13">of a </span><span class="font12">few candies or apples on Sunday and do not do something to prevent large manufacturers from keeping their factories open on the Lord’s Day. I have been in </span><span class="font13">a </span><span class="font12">steel mill in Nova Scotia, where the men are working eleven hours on the day shift and thirteen on the night shift for seven days a week : and if they get off work on Sunday they must make up for it by working the full twenty-four hours the next Sunday. It is a wonder to </span><span class="font13">me </span><span class="font12">that the Lord's Day Alliance does not exert its strength in an endeavor to shut such plants on Sunday and thus allow the employes a day of rest.” [Blast furnaces, once blown in, cannot ho economically closed </span><span class="font13">down on </span><span class="font12">Sundays.—Ed.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We dimly suspect that Mr. Woodsworth's &quot;wonder” is not so innocent as it appears; for it has always been a patent fact that the prohibitions of the Lord's Day Alliance are never aimed at making the Lord’s day a real day of rest, by curtailing all activities.

<p><span class="font13">Great is the power of the ubiquitous want-ad I We can only hope that the pastor is indeed sound in Bible doctrine, and is not too much befuddled with dark-age creeds—a vastly different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The proposed revision of the Psalms of David as recorded in the daily press is causing some comment, most of which seems, so far, to be in favor thereof. A cursory glance at the suggested changes leads one to the opinion that at last the hard shell of the nominal church is beginning to crack, and a little light seeping into the dim chambers where the old credal fetishes arc still kept. Pastor Russell’s industrious attack on the brimstone hell is receiving tardy recognition, although even yet the clerics do not admit his instrumentality in ridding the world of this dark-age incubus; however, the manifest desire to get away from the phraseology of the King James Bible that still conveys the hell-fire idea is a sign of progress that we are glad to welcome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">March 24 issue, under the caption &quot;Outlook </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the Church,” is interesting. One cannot help but think back to the days when our gallant patriots took inoffensive Bible Students ami maltreated, fined and jailed them for having in their possession copies of the Holy Scriptures or of hymn-books, as was done in many cases during the Great War. We wonder, however, how long it would be before the paid capitalist agitators would be preaching the same balderdash from their pulpits and rostrums, should there be another war! It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“There is considerable food for thought in a striking article that appears in the current issue of The Christian Century on ‘The Church and War/ If war is ever to be abolished, the writer contends, it must be by the refusal of the Church to participate in it. Such a thing as a righteous war the writer regards as a contradiction in terms. There are sufficient Christians in the world today, he believes, to abolish war if they would refuse to share in it. ‘For my part I will not go to war,’ he says. ‘It is not that I do not love my country; I do. It is not that I count my </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">life too</span><span class="font12"> dear to sacrifice it for the safety and liberty of others; I do not. But war is not a method of adjusting international disputes any more than a fist fight is a method of adjusting a dispute between individuals, or lynching a method for adjusting a public scandal. To condemn war in time of peace and support it when it is going on is as illogical as condemning the liquor traffic and patronizing it, or cond</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">emni</span><span class="font12">ng gambling and taking a hand in the game.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font13">N APRIL twentieth, with but one dissenting vote, the Florida Legislature put an end to the leasing of convicts to the lumber companies of that state, which means that no more men will be flogged to death in the prison camps of that commonwealth. Readers of The Golden Age will be glad to know that this victory for the cause of humanity is directly traceable to the article “A Hebrew in Christian Florida,” by Isaac Herman Schwartz, which appeared in our issue Number 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In December, only a few months after the whipping to death of the negro Ned Thompson, and the attempt to kill Schwartz by the same method, the whipping boss of the $800,000 Putnam Lumber Company of Jacksonville whipped to death a 22-year-old boy, Martin Tabert, of North Dakota.. Tabert’s relatives had just sent $75, to pay his $25 fine for stealing a ride on </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">J freight train; but Tabert was dead, flogged to -j death, and the money was returned to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font13">mother marked, “Returned by request of sheriff. Party gone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Readers of The Golden Age put the matter before the authorities. The governor of North Dakota demanded the arrest and trial of the whipping boss; and he has been indicted for murder. Attorneys and judges from North Dakota visited Florida and lectured to large audiences, urging the abolition of the convict- -5 leasing system, and reading to them from the Schwartz article in The Golden Age. After eighteen days of debate in the Legislature, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">matter terminated as above, in the interest of justice and humanity. Relatives of Tabert </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font13">&quot;j| sued the Putnam Lumber Company for $50,000.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>The Narrow Way and Other Ways</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘&quot;Narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it.”—Matthew 7:14.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">O</span><span class="font13">ER Lord uttered these words at the first advent, hence just at the close of the Jewish age and at the opening of the Gospel age. We are not to expect that the narrow way 'will continue in the future indefinitely. The way of righteousness is narrow at the present time because this Gospel age is a part of “this present evil world,” or dispensation, during which Satan is the prince or ruler. The Golden Age belongs to the new dispensation, after the establishment of Christ’s kingdom and the binding of Satan and the annulling of his blinding influence. In that glorious day the way of righteousness will not be narrow and difficult, but easy, and the way of unrighteousness will be hard, a difficult way; for all the influences then will be favorable to righteousness and 'contrary to sin, whereas now the general let us pause to examine the testimony of Scrip-<sup>1 </sup>turn respecting any offer of life everlasting, either by a narrow way or by any other way, prior to our Lord’s advent and His proclamation of the gospel. Previously God’s dealings had been only with Abraham and his seed, the Israelites. All others, as the Apostle declares,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">influences are favorable to sin and unfavorable to righteousness. It is this that makes the Christian way a narrow and difficult one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christ’s Mission on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">L</span><span class="font13">OOKING back we perceive that this narrow way to life did not exist in the Jewish age and previous ages. It may be a surprise even to Bible students to notice that there* was no way of life at all previous to the corning of our Lord to be the redeemer and Life-giver. To this thought agree the words of the Apostle that “Christ . . . brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.” (2 Timothy 1:10) That is to say, that although God had impliedly promised a future life in the promise made to Abraham and in the various promises of restitution “spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets,” nevertheless He had not shown how’ it would be accomplished and by whom it would be accomplished. But when the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world it manifested the divine love and sympathy for the world; it showed how God could be just and yet be the Justifier of all who w ould believe in Jesus and obey Him; it brought to light Jesus as the great Seed of Abraham and God's gift of immortality to Him and to the overcoming church, His bride; and it brought to light the future everlasting life opportunities to be granted to the world through the glorified church during the Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">without God in the world — aliens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">strangers, foreigners from the commonwealth J of Israel. (Ephesians 2:12) Evidently, then, &quot;■ there was no way of life open to the world ' ( prior to the redemptive work of Christ. The law given to Israel did indeed give thdt nation ;; a different path or course from the remainder of the world. It was a narrow way and they - ■ thought it to be a way of life, but, as the Apos- j tie explains, they found it to be a way of death. A (Romans 7:10) The Apostle most distinctly : declares that the law covenant justified none of them, conducted none of them to life everlast- ’ ing. Hear him: &quot;The law made nothing per- A; feet.” (Hebrews 7:19) &quot;By the deeds of the g law there shall no flesh be justified in God’s ? sight'’ (Romans 3:20), combating the Jewish notion that somehow or other the giving of the ” law to their nation justified them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Must Obey the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">rpjfE Apostle points out that not he who v-receives a copy of the law nor he who hears</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">the law is justified by it, but only he who obeys y it—he who does the things required by the &lt;&nbsp;law. (Romans 2:13) The Apostle points out -again that the difficulty lay not in the law given h to Israel, which was holy, just, and good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(Romans 7:12) The difficulty lay in the Jews I themselves; they were like all other people of the world, fallen, sinners. Our Lord corrobo-rated the Apostle's statement that none of the A Jews were justified by the law, saying, “Did ’ not Moses give you the law, and yet none of A you keepeth the law?” (John 7:19) The apostle Paul again declares: &quot;A man is not justified. A by the works of the law . . . for by the works i of the law shall no flesh be justified.” (Galatians A 2:1(5) And again he says; &quot;That no man is &nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">justified by the law in the sight of God is evi- &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">dent.” (Galatians 3:11) The sum of the whole, matter is that while the Jews had a blessing </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">the way of divine instruction through the law, A yet, because unable to keep its requirements, they were specially condemned by it; and this special condemnation that was on the Jews more than on the other nations of the world is in the Scriptures called the “curse of the law.” Our Lord’s redemptive work was not only necessary to relieve the world of mankind from the incubus of original sin entailed through Adam, but additionally upon the nation of Israel for the cancellation of the special curse or sentence upon that nation through its failure to comply with the terms of the law covenant. Hence the Apostle says of Christ: ‘He was made a curse for us’ [the Jews],—Gal. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Apostle explains that the giving to Israel </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the law covenant with its typical sacrifices, ’‘which can never take away sins,” was merely </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">foreshadowing of the better hopes built upon </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">better sacrifices of this Gospel age. (Hebrews 10:11) The narrow w<sup>T</sup>ay belongs exclusively to this Gospel age, and not to any time previous nor to any time future. It began with our Lord Himself, who was the forerunner in this way, and who has invited the Gospel church to walk in His steps—His steps of self-denial, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">self-sacrifice.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Narrow Way of Life</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HIS way is a sacrificial way, a narrow way, because of the evil and fallen conditions everywhere abounding. To walk with the Lord in holiness of will and, as far as possible, in holiness of fife means to be so different from humanity in general as to be thought peculiar, to be more or less shunned by the children of this world. It means more than negative opposition to the world, too; it means to take a positive stand for the Lord, for the truth of His Word, for righteousness in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The whole world has been begotten once to life as children of Adam; but Adamic life having been corrupted and forfeited at its very fountain, the result is that the world is a dying world, physically, mentally and morally, all </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">natural tendencies being toward sin and death. This way or tendency of the world our Lord described as the broad road w’hich leads </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">io </span><span class="font13">destruction. Unless they are rescued from </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font13">by Him the result would eventually be destruction for all, not eternal torment, but destruction, as our Lord declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The way of the Lord in this present time is </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">made </span><span class="font13">narrow and difficult and hard to find</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">because the Lord seeks only a very choice class ’ pja at the present time, the little flock to whom </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it '3 </span><span class="font13">is the Father’s good pleasure to give the king- .’3 dom. The self-sacrificing, nevertheless, in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">present time, not only appeals to a small proportion of those who enter it and w<sup>T</sup>ho would run with patience in it the race set before them in the gospel, but also serves to develop in them faith, obedience, gentleness, meekness, patience, la loo., <sub>:</sub> offering, brotherly kindness, love, and thus to “make them meet [fitJ for the inheritance </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">18 the saints in light,” the kingdom inheritance, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font13">joint-heirs with Christ to bless the world of 13 mankind.—Colossians 1</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">:12.</span><span class="font13"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-J</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is no other way of life open at the 3 present time than this narrow one, hence </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font13">18 behooves all who name the name of Christ and aspire to become members of His consecrated band to sit down and count the cost before making the consecration so that there may </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font13">no looking back after once they have put their -a hand to the plow. These are said to be begotten again, begotten not of the will of the flesh, not of man, but begotten of truth. (John 1:13; James 1:18) These who walk in the narrow | way are Scripturally called “new creatures </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">Christ Jesus.”—2 Corinthians 5:17.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>A Change of Nature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font20">F</span><span class="font13">OK these is provided in God’s plan a total change of nature, so that in the resurrection, instead of returning to their former estate </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font13">being perfected, as human beings, they will be perfected as new creatures, as spirit beings. The resurrection of the over comers of the church is described in 1 Corinthians 15:42-44. The Apostle declares respecting their death that they are sown animal bodies, and respecting their resurrection that they are raised spiritual bodies; sown in weakness, raised in power; sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory. It will thus be seen that the narrow way of this Gospel age has attached to it exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might become partakers of the divine nature—epiritual nature. *</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">The very fact that the Golden Age is provided in the divine plan, the very fact </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font13">Christ and His church associated with Him </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font13">the Seed of Abraham are to bless the world, -all the families of the earth during the Millennium, the very fact </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">that all </span><span class="font13">this </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font13">be </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">after / </span><span class="font13">Satan shall have been bound, implies that the way of life in the future will not be so narrow, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font13">steep, so rugged, so difficult to find and so difficult to walk in as is the narrow way of this Gospel age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Respecting the way of life in the future, during the Golden Age, the Prophet expressly declares that it shall be a broad highway instead of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">narrow way or </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">by-path. I nstead of being full of stumbling stones and difficulties and trials he declares that all the stumbling stones shall be gathered out; instead of having besetments from the adversary w-ho gocth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and from many ravenous beasts in human form, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font13">declares that no lion shell be there nor any ravenous beasts, and that nothing shall injure those who seek to go up on that highway of holiness. Let us quote his words from that chapter which so graphically describes the blessings of the Golden Age and which opens with the declaration: “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Way of Holiness</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE quotation reads: &quot;And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it: but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men though unwise, shall not err therein. Xo lion shall be there nor any ravenous heast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there; and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”—Isaiah 35: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">All who in the narrow way have learned what </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font13">means to “fight the good fight” against the world, the flesh and the devil under present conditions and who additionally have attained </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">reasonable measure of growth in the knowledge and grace of the Lord, will be glad indeed to know that in the divine plan the world of mankind when called to human perfection, to restitution of all things spoken by all the holy prophets, will find the way an easier one than </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font13">those who now are pressing along for the heavenly prize.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">The divine arrangement for our first parents &nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">My Heart-Garden </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">By a Subscriber</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Th® writer of this exquisite allegory has recently passed away; tha fruits of her heart-garden have all been gathered.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">TN THESE days of gardens and gardenmaking, when many of us are cultivating the flowers our grandmothers cared for and loved, and when what to grow and how to grow them are matters of daily increasing thought, you may be interested to know how a garden was laid out and planted by one who could not even see the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This garden lies in a darkened room; no sunshine falls upon it, no pale moonlight floods its fragrant flowers; and even the breezes must be tempered ere they are -welcomed. But it grows and thrives, and gives a world of pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Come and walk with me through this garden of mine. There we will enter through the wide gate of Imagination. Let us wander down the central path. It is firm and hard because it is made of Grit, and on both sides there are lovely flowers in bloom. There is a large bed of Patience, the coloring is always soft and gentle. There is a bed of beautiful bright blossoms of Hope. Nearby are the sturdy plants called Courage, climbing high on steadfast poles; and that dear little vine running close to the ground in and out among the flowers is known as Cheerfulness. In that southerly corner there is a small hotbed of beautiful flowers called Smiles, which, as you well know, often have to be forced. Down at the end of the path trickles a tiny fountain, which sings a trusting little song and in whose shining pool I wash away my fears and tears. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">See what </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">high fence I have built </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">around </span><span class="font13">-J my garden! It is made of Determination, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font13">good stout posts of Perseverance. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">This proteo- </span><span class="font13">q tion is absolutely necessary to keep out the Grumble Vine, an annoying, persistent </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">weed </span><span class="font13">yl doing no end of harm, which grows just outside and which is continually trying to creep - j in. It runs along on a sort of network of its own devising; and once it became so strong that it actually broke down a portion of the q fence and crept into the garden. I repaired the break with a good piece of Pluck, and cut ddwn the vine. Alas! the root is always there, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">how- </span><span class="font13">i ever; although if I am watchful the tendrils rarely get above the barriers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Outside my garden grows a large tree, in appearance something like a weeping willow, yj It is called the tree of Discouragement, and often casts a shade over my beautiful flowers. 'cS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Occasionally just at nightfall a big black bird comes and sings in the branches. It is known S as the Complaining Bird and makes its nest in 3 the swamp of Self-Pity. It has a dreary, depressing, mournful note to which I </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">try to pay </span><span class="font13">no heed. It does not come very often; and if </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font13">refuse to listen, it flies away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The only implement I use in my garden is </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font13">Iron Will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’-j</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Let me gather you a nosegay of Patience^ | Hope, Courage, and Cheerfulness. You will see 3 that I always tie the blossoms together with </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">-yj string of good Resolutions. You, too, can enter through the gateway and make a garden of your J3 own; but you must plant the flowers yourself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">K</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Wlth Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, STI &quot;The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>]ei</sup> </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font13"> the human race, then, from Adam until now having been born imperfect, it follows that if any ever get full life and the right to life he must get it through the loving Jehovah God. Unless God had made some provision for the redemption of man from death and the lifting </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font13">of him again to the condition of life, the time would come when there would be no people on the earth. We remember that Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years; and now a man scarcely lives to be half a century old. The race has been degenerating for centuries, growing weaker and weaker, and ultimately all would come to that condition in which they would be unable to transmit even the spark of life, and the earth would be depopulated. Hence we see our utter dependence upon God; and if we find </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">great Jehovah has made a provision for us to live, that ought to fill our hearts with gratitude ; and as we further ewainine His great plan it should fill our hearts with boundless love for Him. And surely that provision would bring joy to the heart and enable one to see that such provision constitutes one of the strings upon the great harp of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Redemption Foreshadowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">provision for having the terms </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of the judgment </span><span class="font13">Ai met by another, equal to Adam; and this </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font13">A exactly what we find the Scriptures to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">disclose </span><span class="font13">A that He did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>lfi7</sup>Jehovah desired that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">man should under</span><span class="font13">stand the necessity and reason for providing i-redemption, that when man does understand it G he will rejoice in the loving-kindness </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">mani- A </span><span class="font13">Tested by God toward him. For this </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">reason </span><span class="font13">y God caused certain pictures or types to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">bs . </span><span class="font13">made by His people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18f</sup>On </span><span class="font13">the night that Jehovah led the children <sup>; </sup>of Israel out of the laud of Egypt He caused </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">lamb to be slain and its blood sprinkled upon the doorposts of the house and the people </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font13">eat that lamb, and arranged that at </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">midnight </span><span class="font13">the death angel would pass through and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">smite </span><span class="font13">the firstborn of every house where the blood did not appear upon the doorposts.

The lamb pictured the one who should he the ransomer or redeemer of mankind. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font13">blood pictured the life poured out to provide </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">redemptive price.—Exodus 12: 3-17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>,RS</sup>At the time that Jehovah entered the judgment or sentence against man He vaguely hinted at a time coming when man should be released from that judgment. Satan, one of whose names is the old serpent, was the first inducing cause of sin. And God at that time said to him: </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">‘T </span><span class="font13">will put. enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head.” (Genesis 3:15) This foreshadowed the fact that ultimately Satan should </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font13">destroyed, and that the same would result </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font13">blessing to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18S</sup>But we must remember that the judgment </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">God entered against man must stand forever. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font13">conld not be reversed or set aside or annulled, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font13">the reason that Jehovah cannot deny Himself. Nor could any of His creatures have faith in Him if he changed His mind. While it is true that this judgment must stand forever, it is equally true that God could make a consistent</span></p>

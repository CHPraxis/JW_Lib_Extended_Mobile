<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font10">R. A. A. LOEWENTHAL, former professor of mental and nervous diseases at the University of Chicago, has made the statement that “at the present rate of increase the world ~ will be ruled by madness within fifty years.” In this article we give some of the data upon f which such ap opinion rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i. We do not have to go far away from home to ■' find plenty of data. New York State heads the ; Jist of states with the highest number of per-£ sons with mental disorders per hundred thousand of the population, and in New York State more persons were sent to the insane asylum ^during the last year than in any previous year. * At the end of 1921 the patients in the thirteen j^siate hospitals for the insane numbered 39,736, span increase of 1,445 over 1920. This is 6,642 more than the hospitals were built to accommo-s date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">» Of the total number of patients in New York fe State one-half were born in Europe, and nearly r one-third of all the patients were out and out A aliens. From this number two hundred and 7 ninety persons were sent back, during the year ending June 30, 1920, to the foreign countries frpm which they came. Under the law, any peri sons showing insanity within five years after i admission to America may be returned to their former homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Massachusetts comes next to New York in its number of insane per hundred thousand of the population. Dr. Briggs, former chairman of the Board of Insanity, says that in Massachusetts-one person in every ten at some time or other enters an insane or feeble-minded hospital, and ■ that five percent of all the deaths in the state are in state institutions of one kind or another. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font10"> These figures are so large that we hesitate to ■_ publish them; but these are the data before us, and we hhve no reason to question them. Mas’ aachusetts spends six million dollars annually &gt;&nbsp;for the care of delinquents. Connecticut, Ver-ttiont, Montana, and Oregon — all northern</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">states —have heavy percentages of insanity; the lowest percentages are in the South.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font10">Taking the country as a whole, insanity and</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark7"><span class="font10">mental disorders are increasing four times .</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font10">by madness, we find that both the Bible and ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">secular history show<sup>T</sup> that it has been ruled by madmen for more than 2,520 years. Nebuchadnezzar, the first w’orld-ruler, represented Gentile rule in the earth. He was insane for seven . years; those seven years represent the seven &lt;&nbsp;“Gentile Times”.the period from the overthrow &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Gentile rule and almost ended it actually.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font10">The condition of affairs during those 2,520 years, proves that the rulers have been mad-</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font10">Tako the inordinately vain Kaiser Wilhelm II. His father and his grandfather were sane, but his earlier ancestors showed all the evidence of minds that were out of balance. -Frederick I was a spendthrift and tyrant; : Frederick William I was bloodthirsty, tyran- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font10">erations were weak-minded fanatics, and Wil- ' Z: i liam IV died insane. Before the Kaiser’s birth</span></a></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">thought to have been born dead; it is almost a &lt;&nbsp;pity that he had not been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But what can we boast about on this side of the Atlantic? There was every reason that sanity could urge why America should have stayed put of the war. America was in no more possible danger of an invasion from the Germans than it was from the Patagonians. But America had a ruler of the same general type as the Kaiser — vain, egotistical, heady; and as he thought that the lives, fortunes, .and influence for good of the American -people were all at stake they were herded into a Avar against those interests and to their own ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the crazy rulers arc not planning the. ruin of the people by driving them into some Avar, they are planning their ruin economically. The avoAved purpose of politicians is to sustain a system which hands over most of the wealth to those Avho do no useful work, and to keep that class in luxury, while the workers receive, a bare subsistence. What could be crazier?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Causes of Insanity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">T THE top of the list of the causes of insanity we put the influence' of the demons, evil spirits. It is our firm belief that a large proportion of the insane are in their present condition because in some way they have fallen under the influence of these beings that infest the earth’s atmosphere. The Scriptures name them as the cause of the World War, ‘going forth ... to gather the kings of the whole earth together to the battle of the great day of God Almighty.’ (Re\ elation 16: 14) 'The Czar of Russia Avas controlled by demons through Rasputin, a spirit medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ways in which the demons get into contact with humans are many. One of the principal of these is through the clergy Avho are directly under their influence. “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit.” (Revelation 18:2) From this we conclude that wherever else the demons are to be found, their general headquarters is in the nominal church. And wdiat is the general influence of the nominal church? In a time of war is it for peace ? In a time of economic ■strife is it for the under-dog? E -. crybody knows the answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another way in AA'hich the demons get into contact Avith humans is through mediums, who d constantly advertise in the papers as clairvoy- ,■&lt; ants, healers, consulters and revealers of hid- ■ den things. Many brainy people, many talented &lt;&nbsp;personages, are among spiritism’s devotees, not? knowing the true explanation of its phenomena. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Too much attention to the operations of the mind is a cause of insanity. When one spends -A too much time pondering upon the operations W of his own mind he is in a fair way to lose con- As trol of it. Manual dexterity does not come from ) gazing at one’s hands or poring over one’s anatomy, but from paying close attention to &quot;--A the things in hand. It is the same way with the -mind.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Genius and Temperament</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">TAR. E. S. SOUTHARD, an eminent alienist</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? from Boston, president of the Americai^ Mental and Psychical Association, in an address at Philadelphia asserted that every form of neurosis may be classified as a form of insanity, that every “temperamental” person is , really insane, and that from this point of view all mankind are unbalanced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— • .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Musicians, painters, and poets all bear testi- A mony to the fact that talent, genius, and insan- J ity are closely allied. The craze for paintings by cubists and futurists, which has but lately died aAvay, was insane; many of the modern I dances and the music which accompanies them I are the work of disordered minds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When it comes to authors, we see the eccen-tricities of Francis Bret Harte finding heredi- | tary expression in his daughter, Jessamy Harte Steel, until her career is ended by confinement in the St. Lawrence Hospital for the Insane. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was mental unsoundness on both sides 3 of the poet Cowper’s ancestry; and he himself j| suffered from hallucinations, melancholia and 5 suicidal mania, spending over a year in an j asylum. Shelley had an insane ancestry, was i subject to vivid hallucinations, and at school .4 rvas known as “Mad Shelley.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Charles Lamb, at the age of twenty, was com-mitted to an asylum; and his sister Mary while insane murdered her mother. There was iiisan-ity in Wordsworth’s family. His sister Doro- -&quot;*1 thy, of his own poetical temperament', became 3 hopelessly insane. - Southey came of insane stock on his mother’s side.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>. Noise and Worry</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">£ ■ ’ TAR. NANCE, trustee of the Sanitary Dis</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">U</span><span class="font10"> trict of Chicago, puts down the unnecessary noises of city life as one of the direct causes of insanity. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘TJnnecessary noises are the bane of metropolitan existence. ■ They murder sleep, assassinate mental rest, shatter our nerves, and indirectly shorten our lives: Factory whistles screeching three times a day, in addition to steamboat, tug-boat and locomotive whistles, the grinding, crunching, munching of flat-wheeled j street-cars and elevated trains, the shrill sirens of auto ... trucks, the cannonade of exploding motors, venders of ■ vegetables crying their song of sale, boys screaming ' . extra papers, barking dogs, howling cats, rattling milkwagons, the untimely sounding of guns, church bells, ■ hand organs and barrel organs, the discordant piano and whining phonograph, the amateur trombone, the Baxaphone in practice. Noise! It.increases the death ' rate by murdering sleep. It destroys the vital and recu-. perative powers of the sick. It increases deafness. It &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helps indirectly to fill our insane asylums. There is</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little doubt but that many nervous wrecks are created</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">i । every year by the incessant din and clamor to which the : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average city resident is continually subjected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i Unemployment is a cause of insanity, so the doctors say who have thousands of the insane under their care. They notice that cases multiply more rapidly as the waves of unemployment come. Thus worry over the needs of one’s loved ones, due to lack of work on the part of ..; the family bread-winner, may so fill the mind as to break down the mental balance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">■ . The war was a direct cause of insanity. There</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ ■ are 400,000 mentally deranged in Paris, mostly from that cause; and from the American forces ■ alone 72,000 are reported by the American</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">. , Legion as mentally deranged. Consequently the total number on all fronts and in all sides . ' of the conflict must be nearly or quite half a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the war was an indirect cause of insani ity to great numbers who found no way of reconciling the conflicting voices of conscience, loyalty, duty, self-preservation, patriotism, etc., presented to them. Moral courage makes for sanity. The man who takes a stand, one way or the other, and abides by what he believes to be right, will endure the reverses of life with a courage and success that will seem almost supernatural. Children should be trained to-face unpleasant situations and to make the best of them, but not to worry about them.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Too Much Excitement</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE movie theaters have been blamed for some of the increase in insanity, and probably not without reason. Every form of mental strain is depicted by the actors, and this cannot fail to have some effect upon those who are suffering mentally or are predisposed to insanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Much insanity is caused by bacteria and poisons of various kinds undermining the brain structure through the blood stream. The germs of syphilis are deadly to the brain structure; and there is scarcely a person who does not’ have it in his blood, cither bovine syphilis, derived from vaccination, or the real thing obtained from our tainted (not sainted) ancestors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. J. M. Lee, of Rochester, N. Y., speaking before a conference of medical men, pointed out that farmers are more susceptible to insanity than any other class because they work hard, worry much and have little recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">.He added: “Our methods of living, our methods of eating, and the general hustle and ten-dcncy to worry throw the mental machinerj out of gear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people who become insane lose the grip on the realities of life. Rage is insanity while it lasts; and some pretty well-balanced people sometimes allow themselves to fall into fits of rage, even to the extent of committing murder and suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The evading of responsibilities tends toward insanity. The more hopelessly insane a person ■ is the more he acts like an infant, assuming that whatever he wishes should be provided for him by others because he desires it. The possession of a disposition to wish to get.along without work is therefore an evidence of insanity. It indicates the neurotic mind. The desire to work, to produce, so that one may have for himself and have to give to others, is an evi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’dence of sanity. The idle rich, are all on the road to insanity, and many of them are actually insane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. Liquor and Insanity</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SPHERE are conflicting opinions as to the - share of responsibility to be attributed to liquor as a cause for increased insanity. Doctor Hall, Chairman of the Insanity Commission of Cook County, Illinois, says: “Either prohibition does not prohibit, or the brand of liquor ’ . that drinkers are getting is more violent in its A t effect.” His report shows an increase of thirty-|hree percent in the number of alcoholic cases . before the commission in December of 1921 over fx-. thoge of pre-prohibition days. He said further: </span><span class="font9">■ y'-. &quot;There are two classes of alcoholic cases wc are get. ’ ting. There is. a class of elderly persons who were ' fi accustomed to use a certain amount of liquor regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They were able to coordinate and to combat social, domestic and business worries. Then prohibition came, and they were unable to obtain liquor regularly. When they did get it, it would be by the bottle. Not knowing when they would get more, they would drink it all at once. As a result they broke down mentally. <sup>r</sup>rhe other class comprises the young, who get the unlabeled or .moonshine whiskey. They drink all they can get. when they can get it. It contains a large percentage of poison and works havoc with their minds. Wc had several eases of young doctors who wrote their own prescriptions, and a got bad whiskey, which they drank to excess, resulting in their breakdown. It has been necessary to commit • : several to an asylum for the insane.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Lichtenstein, resident physician at the • ■' Tombs Prison, New York City, thinks alcohol ‘ is doing its share toward the increase of insanity. He says that many steady drinkers are . ' unable to give up intoxicating liquor and will drink poisonous substitutes which are offered for sale; that this alcohol is absorbed through the lymphatic system and causes a toxic condition which deadens the nervous system and produces what is known to alienists as alcoholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• , psychosis. Whether a person becomes incurably insane is dependent upon how much dam: ■ age is done to the nervous system before treatmerit begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hut Dr. R. H. Hutchins, Sr., superintendent of the Utica, N. Y., State Hospital, says that moonshine whiskey has caused<sup>!</sup> only a slight increase in insanity. His belief is that the . stories of widespread insanity caused by impure whiskey were propaganda of wet advocates; and that for years, with, the exception of the first four or five months after prohibition went into effect, hospital cases resulting from whiskey had steadily decreased in number. Homer Folks, secretary of the State Charities Aid Association, said that he believed the' number of persons who had gone insane from the use of alcohol during 1921 was fewer than normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An indirect cause of increased insanity due to prohibition is that many -persons who had become used to taking intoxicating liquors were deprived of them and resorted to drugs to satisfy their appetites. We have treated the subject of drug addiction at length in our issue of. June 21, 1922. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '</span></p>

He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“There are 20,000 new cases of dementia prccox every year and all declare 1 hat it is on the increase. The mem tai phenomena vary with different cases. The physical ; phenomena prow* llial in a very large percent, the , patients have faulty digestion and faulty circulation </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9">well as faulty elimination, and wc will find in almost all of (hem a faulty respiration, very little if any abdominal breathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Wlwii ire remember that we can retard or completely stop the respiration by pressing on any one of thfy. ■ bra. lies of the sympathetic nerves that may be. abnor-null, either in the upper or lower orifices of the body, . . . then it is plain to us that if any one or more of lliese branches become involved so that the respiration &quot;&nbsp;is impeded and the sympathetic normal efficiency ia reduced it is reasonable to sav filial ihe elimination and digestion as well as assimilation will be reduced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Therefore in order to relieve one. of these cases we must see to it that every branch must be inspected and ■ cared for, so that we can have as nearly as possible </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">S </span><span class="font9">normal functions. Why? Because normal functions must obtain if wc are to have normal use of the cerebrospinal in all of its varied duties, and the highest of these is normal thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We must first eliminate the fact that there is' </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font9">central lesion; when that is done it is admitted </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font9">the primary cause is not in the brain. Then we pro- . । ceed to examine the functions.

<p><span class="font9">“We find also that these cases are suffering from , varied degrees of auto toxemia, so that auto-intoxication obtains a part or all the time. It is phi in that as long as the. patient’s auto-into.xication persists he will not be responsible, but when his toxemia is reduced below the state of intoxication ho then will be responsible and his mental condition will be clear. But he will not be well until the toxemia is reduced to such an ' extent that the functions of the body will be normal each day, accompanied by normal blood and normal blood pressure. And more, all of the functions of the - - body must obtain until the strength of the entire body ■ has been&quot; restored; and then will he have normal poise</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“The sympathetic system being first corrected, the ■ ■ diet carefully chosen, baths prescribed, we must, if pos-n sible change the blood pressure. In these eases we have a venous status whether in high or low blood pressure</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“We will all admit that the poisons from the different tissues are being thrown into the veins and that if &quot;we ' can reduce the poisons by any means we will shorten — the recovery of the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Every now and again we find that the pressure goes up and down from some fault in somebody or the * patient, and we find that anything that will cause loose movements of the bowels will upset our blood pressure.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">- that if he has arrived at the happy medium where his , ... thoughts are lucid and his poise is perfect under all ■ occasions it is up to him to thus remain; that evidently his assimilation and elimination which take place in - the&quot; millions of capillaries in all parts of his body which make it possible for him to live and carry on both '. physically and mentally are performing their functions</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">B. SCHLAPP, Professor </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> neuropathology at the Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital, New York City (who is authority for the statement that twenty-five percent of the murders in this country were committed by insane persons who could have been cured by proper treatment in early stages), writes of the discoveries that have been .made iij recent years in endocrinopathy, or diseases due to improper working of the ductless glands of internal secretion. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Twenty years ago the very term was unknown and the science of the ductless glands had no standing. Today our knowledge of the endocrines and their influence upon every function of the nervous system in man promises to revolutionize our whole understanding of human behavior. We know now that many men commit crimes because their thyroid glands or other glands are out of order. We understand now that many unfortunate human beings are unable to control themselves under temptation or in the face of other arousing stimuli because there is some derangement in the glands. It is now certain that these endocrine organs control the activities of our nerves altogether, including the workings of the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This means of course that science has brought human conduct or misconduct down to a physiological, ’ or rather a chemical, basis. Men do not err because they are evil but because of chemical disturbances in that marvelous and intricate machine, the human body. Just how far we want to go or can go with this state-' ment at present is doubtful, but to some extent it must ’ already be accepted and acted upon; for we are able to treat many criminals, to correct this chemical disturbance or abnormality and thereby to restore these sufferers to health and normality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;At least the well-informed among us know that many of the men who commit crimes are not responsible for their acts but are the victims of disease or pathological or chemical conditions. We know, also, that many men in our prisons should be in hospitals and sanitariums. And we know that a very large proper- ’ tion of all the men sent to prison for felonious breaches of the law are sick men who can be cured of their illness. But we continue to treat these men as pariahs and monsters. Wc continue to torture them and cage them and judge them according to stupid and obsolete standards.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font10">OT straight-jackets and cruelty, but eom-. forts and love, tend to aid those who are ■ insane to regain their mental balance. The ' work at the State Hospital for the Insane, at Trenton, N. J., under Doctor Henry A. Cotton, has proved this conclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here one finds clean, carpeted halls, furnished with rockers and other chairs. The walls are adorned with pictures; there are ferns and plants about. The rooms for patients confined to their beds are perfectly ventilated, and the rooms themselves are large and cheerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dining-room tables are covered with white linen, ihid adorned with ferns and flowers; and the patients are. served with care and attention to the wholesomencss of the food. There are no handcuffs, no chains and no straitjackets; and as a consequence maniacal outbursts are seldom heard. The nurses and attendants are of high class, instructed well in the physical care of their patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Upon the arrival of a patient at the hospital an X-ray of the mouth is taken and infected teeth tare removed. A stomach test is next-made. Then the tonsils are examined; if infected, they are removed. Intestinal examina-tiohs are then made. An abdominal X-ray is <sup>:</sup> next taken; and then a specimen of the blood and spinal fluid is taken and examined. It is a common thing at the Trenton hospital to dis. ■ cover infection of the teeth, tonsils and eOion, -&quot;also in the appendix and gaJl bladder. The rectum is likewise often found to bo ulcerated or otherwise infected, and requiring, surgical attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ As a consequence of these thorough examina-■ tions, and corresponding close medical attention, the record shows that out of 400 patients admitted during 1918-1919 and classified as manic depression, hypermanic, dementia precox, etc., after a period of nine months only &quot;&nbsp;sixty of the patients remained in the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Previous to removing infection from patients the rate of recovery was forty percent; which would mean that 160 of these 400 cases would have been discharged instead of 340.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is almost enough to drive a sane person ' insane to lock him up and give him nothing to do; hence the saner administrations of hospi— - tals for the insane are now paying attention to employment of their charges. In Illinois, whore occupation for the insane, and education for those occupations, has become a practice, ) the class of insane called “maniacs” has almost ' entirely disappeared.

Thia method requires less building material, and the interior walls are kept warm at less expense And then each of the four farmers rents out hit attic to one of the farm hands. This makes </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">warm floor for the farm hand, and brings in a little income to the proprietor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>j</sup></span></p>

Even in the highlands of Scotland, where ordinary cattle would starve, there are the Scotch cattle, with their quaint shaggy hides, that manage to make out a living.

<p><span class="font10">even beautiful young girls in Britain, hardly Out of their, teens, have been compelled to lose their teeth, and to resort to artificial substitutes. In America the teeth are generally sound at forty-five, and frequently much later in life. This difference may be due to increased pyorrhoea in England, or may possibly be due to .excessive tea-drinking or to too many meals during the twenty-four hours. The American custom of three meals a day is more healthful than the British custom of four meals a day, and the American would be still better off with but two meals per day, and so would the Britain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

Strawberries ripen about August 1st. The summer-days are so long in the upper latitudes of Scotland that from the latter part of May until the early part of July it is possible to read fine print with ease at any time of night; but the sun’s rays are too much deflected to give any really hot weather at any time anywhere in the Isles.

In a few places there arc fences, and in some, instances the fence-posts appear to fee. but three feet apart. Not infrequently the fence-posts are vineclad, producing a pleasing appearance to the eye. Occasionally a fence, instead of a wall, surrounds a suburban home. The fence palings are laid partly on one another</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">vertically. These fence palings show Britain’s poverty in forests. Except for the vines trained upon them they would be hideous, and look non© too well anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cleanliness and neatness are everywhere. In plowing, the foreman on the farm first goes . over the field, and by furrows plowed each way ■ expertly marks it off into squares* about ten feet apart. These squares are as straight as. can be imagined. Those who do the remainder of the plowing could hardly fail to plow straight furrows. There seems to be no other object in marking the fields off into squares; if there is, will British readers please advise so that a further statement may be made? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Having entered Scotland via the Midland . Railway, which, in its upper reaches, is well over to the West Coast, the American made the return trip via the North Eastern Railway, which follows the Firth of Forth thirty miles down to the sea and then turns off sharply to the right, hugging for a long distance the rough body of water which Americans know as the North Sea, but which Britains.somewhat euri- ’ ously designate the German Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the mouth of the Forth is Dunbar, distin- ' guished for its red rocky headland and its cas-tie ruins. In the old Dunbar caStle the local. Scottish nobility once successfully withstood a siege of nineteen weeks duration by an English army; and Mary Queen of Scots stopped here on her flight to England.

<p><span class="font10">Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 124 miles southeast of Edinburgh and 273 miles northwest of London, was the American's first stop after leaving Edinburgh. The expression “Carrying coals to Newcastle” arose satirically from the fact that Newcastle is, or was until recently, the greatest coal-exporting city in the world. Cardiff, Wales, contests the honor now. It is a dr,oil enough fact that during the World War conditions arose </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">for a</span><span class="font10"> brief time in Newcastle which did actually make it necessary to do the supposedly unnecessary task of bringing in coal to maintain the great industries there centered. Newcastle is one of England’s Philadelphia and Pittsburghs, a place devoted to the making of largo and heavy machinery. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the bridges still in use across the Tyne .at Newcastle is the famous high-level bridge designed by Robert Stephenson for carrying rail and wagon traffic across the river. It was opened in. 1850. Although it looks curiously heavy for its work it is not actually so; the immense beams and girders are hpllow-cast. The bridge has been recently reconditioned for modern use by putting in such steel beams and rods as are necessary to make it fit. &quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">B</span><span class="font10">UT though Newcastle makes heavy articles ' it also makes some of the finest instillmeats used by scientists. A gentleman engaged in this line of work narrated a most interest- , ing incident of the optophone, the device by which the blind are now enabled to read ordinary printing. The contrivance is such that bymeans of the selenium crystal each printed . letter when presented to the eye-piece of the instrument gives forth a different sound, due to its peculiar shape. After a while the delicately trained ear of the blind is able to identify these sounds, and then the step from that stage , to reading is a short one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A party of scientists had gathered in London to give the instrument a test. A clerk was sent out to get a number of publications which . should be alike, so that all might see that ho error was made. He came back with an armful .. of Bibles, obtained from an adjoining store. The '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">B-Bibles were passed around, and the young |k woman who had been taught to read through O’the instrument was given the open book, and Ke‘-the . instrument was placed in hey hand. The K. first words which she read out to her auditors Sjwere,/‘Let there be light.” It is stated that there fcTWns no connivance in this; and we are of the opinion that if this be true the matter was prob-|<sup>:</sup> ’'ably' arranged by the Lord. Possibly one of g/the holy angels was present and directed the details of the interesting experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5g. The same gentleman was familiar with the Weeing of another new Instrument, the truth *’ detector. - It is claimed for this instrument that the suppressed emotions consequent upon the telling of a falsehood are so startling in their telltale story upon the dial that it is ■well nigh impossible for a person who is being examined •- - to carry out a deception. A criminal denies that <sup>r</sup> lie has ever heard of a certain person; the per... son’s name is unexpectedly incorporated in a <sub>f</sub> question, and the telltale hand in the next room .betrays that for some reason that name is of uncommon interest. Of course the person being . examined is connected electrically -with the \ instrument and with the dial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It Was at Newcastle that the Scottish people, disagreeing with Charles I in his views of taxa- tion without representation, and being in general dissatisfied with his religious views, turned him over to the parliamentary committee com-~ posed of Cromwell and others, who shortly afterward removed his head from his shoulders. ‘ It was; during his feign, especially in the years t 1630^1640, that many of the most progressive <sub>t</sub> people -of England emigrated to America, i Croinwell at- one time had planned, to join these r' emigrants, though he did not need to do so, */ since he had ample means and was well con-nested socially and educationally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">It is easy to see how this kind of anarchy has i been nourished. The Scriptures show that dur- ’ . , ing the Millennium the true church will have ' power over the nations. Falsely claiming to be the true church the Roman Catholic system has ' tried in every possible way to usurp the civil - : power or to lord it over the civikpower. The \ Durham incident is but one. Additionally, it is ’ evident that there was an attempt made here, on the part of somebody, to convey the idea that a Roman Catholic cathedral answers to the city of refuge provided for in the Mosaic! law to which an unintentional manslayer might flee ' ' and find refuge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Durham was one of the most valiant of all the ’ soldiers on the English side. The word bishop ; merely means elder or shepherd or overseer of the Lord’s sheep. The greatest of al! bishops is Christ Jesus, “the shepherd and bishop of , our souls,” and He said: “If my kingdom were -of this &quot;world then would my servants fight, but now is my kingdom not from hence.” But like most of the other people that have claimed the title and office of bishop since the time of Christ, the Bishop of Durham had little use for the teachings or practices of Christ. There haa never been a war in which the bishops did not' align themselves with Satan’s side of the argu- ■ meat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ <sup>:</sup></span></p>

Eboracum does not sound much like York; yet that is what it is, having been pronuonced Caerebroc in the meantime. If a New Yotker were to say that he lived in Novum Eboracum, it would probably lake the postal authorities a long time to find him. But he does; for New York is named after York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">-• The American did not have to change cars at York, but he did it, so as to get a look al the ■ ^famous city walls, and the York Minster, 524 feet in length, 250 feet in breadth, considered the best-lighted cathedral in England, and exceeding in size St. Paul’s cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The great arch in the interior, , 500 feet long and 100 feet in. height, conveys the impression of a great forest aisle bordered by magnificent trees, whose branches arch over</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">York is still entered by four imposing gates. The gates are in. the way; for the city has outgrown its walls, but no one would dare to propose removing them. The view from the walls Is very fine; they constitute an important promenade about the city and are in good condition. _The circuit of the ancient city by means of the wall is about three miles. Within the walls the streets $re narrow and crooked. Some of the names are very odd: Whipmawhopma-gate, Jubbergate, Sheldergate, and Fossgate. Many British streets are named after the gates to or from which they lead. Thus London has its Dowgate, Aidgate, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Lancastergate, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When it comes to history, York has so much to boast of that it would take a large book in which to record it.

The school teacher used to ask: “If a cat with legs 9 inches long can jump 4 ft. the floor how high from the floor should a £ Dian jump whose logs are 3 ft. long?” After | much wrestling with pencil and paper we used to answer:-“If a cat whose legs are 9 inches long can jump 4 ft. off the floor, then a man | Whose legs are 3 ft. long should be able to jump JU 16 ft. off the floor.” What we are wondering ['■ about just now is as to why Mr. Goehring, when I be was at it, did not jump the other 10 ft. 6| finches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tA; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">6 ft. 7 5-16 inches</span><span class="font10"> was the record running high jump made by Mr. E. Beeson, in 1914, in the United States. Mr. Beeson was able to con-yert about 144 inches of his horizontal speed f into vertical speed, his upward jump being that R much better than Mr. Goehring’s standing one. J,’ But even with that he is still about 9| feet be-bind the cat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">?■&quot; ' 11 ft. 6 inches</span><span class="font10"> is the standing long jump made ?. by C. Trielitras, in Athens, in 1912.

<p><span class="font10">P of a pole, made by Frank Foss, in the United Y States, in 1920. This is more than twice, as high » as Mr. Beeson was able to jump without one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is where the human animal gets one on the cat; for it is certain that a cat with a pole would never be able to jump twice as high as he could without it.</span></p>

O'Connor was able to convert about 131 feet of his horizontal speed into horizontal flight, his running jump being that much better than the standing broad jump of Mr. Trielitras. We do not know Mr. O’Connor’s weight, but assume that it-was about 140 pounds. This was carrying a heavy weight through the air a long distance, the legs furnishing the power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">43 ft. 1 1-2 inches</span><span class="font10"> is the distance that Mr. Matthew McGrath put a 56-pound weight in 1917. Mr. McGrath used the powerful muscles of legs, arms and back in propelling this weight this distance. But back we go to the school teacher: “If Mr. Trielitras, weight 140 pounds, is able to propel himself 25 ft. through the air, how far should Mr. McGrath be able to propel through the air a weight of 56 pounds </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tf</span><span class="font10"> And the answer would be or used to be 62| ft.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">158 ft. 4 1-2 inches</span><span class="font10"> is the distance that Mr. A. R. Taipale threw the discus in Copenhagen in 1913. The discus is an ancient Greek game revived. The weight, which is about a foot in its greatest diameter, and convex in.shape, is. hard to throw; and when modern athletes<sup>-</sup>first made records with it in 1901, the distance attained was only 118 ft.

<p><span class="font10">“The windows of heaven will need to open am,” interjected Smith, “before we get any light on that subject.”* .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“You always do,” complained Tyler. “Thore never would be any progress if all followed your example. We should all have been born</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">not careful,” replied Tyler. “Now be quiet; we are wasting time. I want to hear Palmers explanation of the flood busine^.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“There is one theory of the creation of the earth,” said Palmer, “which harmonizes exactly with the Scriptural account. All scientists agree that the earth was at one time in an igneous, or white-hot condition; and at that time everything of a combustible nature was reduced to vapor which surrounded the central rocky core to the. extent of thousands of miles, forming a vast whirling shapeless mass. It is this that is referred to in the second verse of the first chapter of Genesis: 'And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep'.” a “What deep?” asked Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The oceans, of course,” answered Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It could not be the oceans,” replied Palmer, , “because they were not formed until the third ? day, as you will see by the ninth and tenth f verses of this chapter. The deep referred to C was the great mass of vapor which encircled the -'. earth in the beginning. Divine energy moved f ' upon this deep, and the result was that it began £ to take shape. 'The earth was’ is the opening is' statement of Scripture. What vast periods of time may be included in these three words, no</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“The Annular or Canopy theory of creation, &gt;&nbsp;. put forward by Prof. Vail, then states.the mat- ■ . ter, showing the harmony of Science with the Bible. The great deep of vapors surrounding - , the earth would take on its motion,* and oh the outside -would travel at a great speed. As the earth cooled the vapors would cool also, and ' that nearest the surface would descend and- ' cover the planet. The vapor further away would continue to revolve and would be pro- ' -vented from descending by its speed and also by the atmosphere which would be formed by the contact of the descending vapor with the hot earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“This then would be the condition: There ‘ would be waters covering the earth and waters above the earth, and in between the atmosphere -separating both. Could you have this stated more scientifically exact than the Gene'sis ae-count which says that God formed,the firma- ; . ment, or atmosphere, that it might separate the . waters which were above the firmament from-the waters below the firmament ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Does it really say that?” asked Tyler. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Yes,” said Palmer. “I have my Bible here, and Wynn can read it for us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He then handed a pocket Bible to Wynn, who read Genesis 1:6-8. “And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament and divided the waters-which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“I had often wondered what it could mean, myself,” said Palmer; “and when I read </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">this </span><span class="font10">explanation I felt convinced of its truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The waters above the firmament would gradually form into rings, and revolve about the earth as the rings of Saturn do about </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font10">today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“One by one these rings approached the earth and, coming into contact with the atmosphere, w<sup>r</sup>ould spread out and form a canopy; this would descend to the earth at the place of least resistance which would be near the poles 1 of the earth, bringing down with it much carbon and other minerals, and in this way the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“The earth has had more than one flood, as .scientists declare; and each ring as it descended</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">made great bhanges in the earth. I think that f.*. here we have an adequate explanation of how* $ ' tire various strata of the earth were laid; and .’•instead of the immense periods of time for which the guesses of scientists have become - famous. 7,000 years, as we have bofore.shown, was ample for the work of each of the creative days.

<p><span class="font10">’ “By the close of the sixth day there was but _ one ring left, and this was of pure water, all '<sup>J</sup>;' the mineral substances having been precipitated to the earth. Descending, this last ring came into contact with the atmosphere, and spread itself out to such an extent that the earth .was like a great greenhouse, making the temperature everywhere the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It was In this hot-house condition, which would be productive of luxuriant growth, that . the perfect man Adam was. placed. That this ' was the condition of the earth prior to the deluge, and that a great and sudden change took place by a tremendous cataclysm, is shown by the fact that huge animals, such as mammoths and elephants, have been found preserved embedded in the ice of the arctic regions. Such animals could not live there under the <sub>z</sub>present conditions. Consequently there must ' have been a time when even these parts were of a different temperature from what they are</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">• “That there was a sudden change from congenial warpith to extreme cold is demonstrated by the fact that .some of these animals have been found with grass in their mouths and stomachs undigested. The break-up of the canopy, or glass-house roof, would cause the equator suddenly to become extremely hot and the poles extremely cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Caves are filled with the remains of these great animals, to which they fled for refuge from the descending ring only to he snowed under and frozen to death; The flood of Noah’s day was a part of the groat work of creation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“Tl^ere is a point of interest worth noticing in connection with this subject: After the deluge God promised* that the earth should not be destroyed with a flood again, and as a sign of . this He placed the bow in the cloud. A rainbow , . was an impossibility while the rings of water h surrounded the planet, as then the direct rays .. of the sun could not penetrate to the earth. But , with the break-up of the system of rings, the . sunlight came directly through and the ref ran-tions of light from the rain produced the bow. . <sub>: </sub>The rainbow is a scientific as well as a moral sign that a universal deluge will not occur again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font10">NLY those who have strong living faith in _ the almighty God and in His Son Jesus F cotald have much interest in the words of our * text.

To the higher critic, ’ Jhe Apostle’s reference to God’s dealings with</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Abraham is nonsensical, believing, as he does, #■ that the statements of Genesis are without * authority and were written many hundreds of b years after the death of Moses. But the internal - evidences and harmony with the plan stamp</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the accoujit as being true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, some of God’s true children, whose eyes of understanding have not yet been opened to a clear apprehension of the divine plan of the ages, may be inclined to question what interest we could possibly have in God’s oath to Abraham,* given mote than three thousand years ago.

<p><span class="font10">_ &quot;&nbsp;selves: “Th^&amp;feveiit was ^helpful to Abraham, but has nothing whatever to do with us or our <sup>:</sup> day.” It is our hope that an examination of L this covenant which God attested with His oath, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">V'</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> as </span><span class="font10">stated in our text, may be helpful to many of the Lord’s people, enabling them to see that i - God had a plan in Abraham’s day; that He is &amp;&nbsp;'still working according to that plan; and that h its completion will be glorious—a blessing to 4 His creatures and an honor to Himself.</span></p>

But the Apostle intimates in the words quoted that God’s special design in giving that cove- ’ nant and in binding it solemnly with an oath was to encourage spiritual Israel, to give us . a firm foundation for faith. God well knew that although three thousand years from His own standpoint would be-but a brief space, “as = a watch in the night,” nevertheless to'us the . time would appear long, and the strain upon faith would be severe; hence the positive statement, and the still more deliberate oath that bound it. We cannot but wonder^at such condescension upon the part of the great Creator— &nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">that He should stoop to explain His great arrangements to His fallen creatures and, above all, that He should condescend to give His oath on the subject. An upright man feels that His word should be sufficient in any matter, and hence would hesitate, except upon certain conditions, to confirm his word with an oath. How much more might the heavenly Father have so regarded the matter! But our text explains the reason for such condescension. He was “willing , more abundantly” to show the unchangeableness of His plan. He wanted His*trusting children to have abundant evidence so that their / faith would, not waver, so that they could trustfully put their hands in His and valiantly run the race unto victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was not God’s purpose to show his plan to the world in general, nor has He done so.

The Christian who cannot understaudingly call to mind this oathbouud covenant or promise evidently lacks information very necessary to his spiritual strength and development. This is clearly indicated in the Apostle’s words in the context; for, after telling us that it is to give consolation to us who have fled for refuge to Christ, that we may lay hold upon the hope sot before us in this oathbound promise, he adds : “Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast,, and which entereth into tjiat within the vail; whither our forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.” (Hebrews 6: 19, 20) Now how can this hope bo an anchor to our souls in all the storms and trials and difficulties of life, in all the opposition of the world, the flesh and the adversary, if we do not know what the hope is, if we have not even recognized the promise upon which this hope is based?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Need we quote the promise, the one so repeatedly referred to in the apostolic writings, the onq which is the basis or anchrmtge of our souls? It was made to Abraham, and reads thus: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth*bc blessed.” (Genesis 22:18) It was a promise for the future, and not for Abraham’? <sup>1 </sup>own time. The world was not blessed in Abra- -ham’s day, nor did he even have 'a child at the time this promise was given. Isaac did not fulfil the promise; he was merely a type of the :■ greater Seed of Abraham who in due time would fulfil it. Jacob and his twelve tribes, fleshly Israel, did not fulfil the promise, but . still looked &quot;for a greater Messiah to fulfil it, to bless them and through them all the families of the earth. The apostle Paul referred to this <sup>1</sup> ' very same promise, declaring that the Seed- of \ ' Ah/aham mentioned therein is Christ. All ' Christians agree to this, although, they have not distinctively and properly associated it with the declarations of the promise. &quot;But the Apostle makes clear to us that in saying that ■ Christ is the Seed of Abraham he had in mind « not only the Lord Jesus as the Head of th?.y.) body, but also the overcoming saints of this t , Gospel age as the body of Christ.

<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font10">OW if the Gospel church, with her Head, the Lord JesUs, as the Apostle states again, saying, “We, brethren, as Isaac was [typified by Isaac], are the children of promise” (Galatians 4:28), it follows that the seed of Abraham mentioned in the promise is not yet complete; for the Gospel church is not yet ■ complete and will not be until the full close of the Gospel age, the harvest time of which we believe we are now in. But-what a wonderful thought is involved in this plain interpretation of the divine Word! It is big with hope for spiritual Israel, the spiritual seed; and no less it means a blessing to the natural seed, fleshly Israel, and ultimately the Millennial blessings to all the families of the earth. Let us examine these three hopes. The hopes for these three classes center in this great oathbound covenant. Let us thus .obtain what the Apostle tells us was the Lord’s intention for us: namely, strong consolation, strong encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- - All through the prophecies the Lord foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories that H'should follow; nevertheless, the glories Jo fol-Bjh&gt;w have been granted much more space in the a? divine revelation than the sufferings of this r present time. The implication suggested by the g.' Apostle is that, when the glories of the future Er shall be.realized, the trials and sufferings and E difficulties of. the present time will be found not worthy to be compared; but those glories and ^' blessings have been veiled from our mental vision, and, instead, a great pall hangs over the £ future in the minds of many of the Lord’s ^ people. With some it is merely a mist of doubt ^and of uncertainty; with others it is the smoke qf confusion, blackness, and despair as they think of their own friends in connection with an eternity of torture and the probability that a |F large majority of those whom they love will s:. spend an eternity of horror in torment. We s- know that~these clouds and dark forebodings came from the dark ages and through the theo-&amp; logical twistings handed down from that time. 5p Many have learned to distort the simple sf language of God’s Word in such a manner as destroy, perish, die, second death, everlasting destruction, etc., all terms used by the Loyd to represent the ultimate complete annihilation of those who will not come into harmony with Him after a full opportunity is granted them, are interpreted to mean the reverse of what they say—Efe, preservation in torture, etc. It is high time that we should learn that God’s Book is not the foundation for these horrible nightmares which have afflicted us, and which have in the past hindered many of us from a proper love and reverence for our Creator. It' is high time that we should take the-explanation which the‘Apostle gives us of this matter and dismiss from our minds all the errors which assail poor humanity regarding the future. He says: “The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Ours is the Cream of the Promise</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font10">OW what hope and interest has the church of Christ in this promise made to Abraham? To the true church belongs the very cream of the promise, “the riches of God’s . grace.” The promise imphes the greatness of the seed of Abraham, “which seed is Christ” and the overcoming church. This greatness is so wonderful as to be almost beyond human comprehension. The overcomers of this Gospel age who “make [their] calling and election sure” in Christ, are to be joint-heirs with Him in the glorious Millennial kingdom which is to' be God’s agency or channel for bringing about the promised blessing, the blessing of all the' famiUes of the earth. How great, how wonderful is to be the exaltation of the church is' beyond human conception! As the Apostle- declares : “Eye hath not seen, nor- ear heard, • neither hath it entered into the heart of man * [the natural man] the things that God hath in reservation for them that love him,” who love him more than they love houses or lands, parents or children, or any other creature, or more than they love themselves, and who show this by walking in the narrow way, in the footsteps of their Redeemer. Again, the Apostle speaks . of the great blessings coming to the church as . the seed of Abraham: “It doth not yet appear .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">what we &quot;hall be [how great we shall be made in. our change] ; but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him.” (1 John 3: 2) The apostle Peter has a word on this subject of the greatness that shall belong to the church, tin; spiritual seed of Abraham, saying, God hath given unto us ‘’exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.” (2 Peter 1:4) To whatever extent we are able to grasp the meaning of these wonderful promises, they speak to us of blessings, favors, privileges, “exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think.”— Ephesians 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Promise to the Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE second class to be blessed under this Abrahamic covenant is fleshly Israel. We are not forgetting that the Jews were a rebel* lious and stiff-necked people, that they slew the prophets, stoned the Lord’s ministers, and caused the crucifixion of our Redeemer. Nevcr-<sub>r</sub> ’ theless, the Scriptures clearly hold forth that &quot;&nbsp;after they have had a period of chastisement, which they have been undergoing as a nation . since the Lord’s crucifixion, and after spiritual Israel shall have been gathered out of the world and shall have been glorified in the king. dom, then a blessing from the Lord will come upon natural Israel. They shall be saved or recovered from their blindness; and, as the <sub>w</sub> prophet declares, they shall look upon Him .whom they have pierced and mourn for Him, because the eyes of their understanding shall ‘ be opened. We rejoice, too, that the promise is clear and distinct that the Lord will pour upon them the “spirit of grace,and of supplications.” —Zechariah 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Apostle Paul elaborates this subject. In &quot;Romans, chapters 9 and 10, he points out that -■ Israel had failed to obtain the special blessing - of this Abrahamic covenant by rejecting Christ <sup>v</sup> —that only a remnant received the great blessing and the mass were blinded. In chapter 11 he proceeds to explain that their blindness is not to be perpetual, but only until the church ghall have been gathered out; and that then the ■ Lord’s blessing will come to fleshly Israel, saving them from blindness and granting them mercy through the glorified spiritual Israel. (Romans 11:25-33) The Apostle expressly • points out that the Lord will do this for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">opposition to the light? It should not surprise ' ’ us; and so we find in this great oathbound covenant a blessing for all nations, all peoples. 1 Let us look at the promise again, remembering that our heavenly Father made it deliberately &quot;&nbsp;and subsequently bound Himself to its provi- &quot;&nbsp;sions by an oath, so that we might not only be’ '4 sure that He could not break His word, but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">doubly sure that He could not break His oath, &nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>u</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and that therefore, without peradventure, this promise shall be fulfilled. It reads: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be &quot;&nbsp;blessed.” What is the blessing so greatly needed by all mankind? We answer: It is the very blessing that Jesus declared He came to give, saying,, “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” ' Ah, yes. Life! It is life that the whole world ' needs; and our Lord Jesus declares Himself to be the great Life-giver. Indeed, in the Syriac ' ■ language, in which probably our Lord discoursed, the word life-giver is the equivalent -.ji of our word savior. Jesus came to save men. from sin and from the penalty of sin: namely, J death. It is a human invention of the dark <sup>s </sup>ages to attach eternal torment as the wages'of ’’ sin; it is the divine arrangement to attach to sin -a reasonable and just, but awful penalty, <sup>A </sup>that of death. It is because of sin that we are ” all dying creatures, and for the Lord to give &lt;&nbsp;life implies that He will take away the sin and «3 all necessity for its penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is for this reason, we are told, that Chiist- '/^ died—for our sins, to release us from their penalty, and thus to have the right to release us from present sinful tendencies and conditions.

<p><span class="font10">MINISTER of the perverted, gospel’de-. clares that there is Bolshevism in the Hpulpits; and he threatens to turn in thither. pHe describes Bolshevism as a force that de-^stroys governments, drives away land owners, (*, and throws to the discard valuable treasures 1of literature, art and religion; that Bolshevism L transforms quiet people into raving maniacs, g .He says that Bolshevism is like a boil upon the £arm—its presence at first, is detected by itch-LJng, then inflammation, then swelling and erup-^tion; that it has been under the surface for » decades; but that onr times and conditions 1/brought on by the war, pestilence and famine, phave brought it to a head; and that the masses Fare bursting under the swelling pressure. Re-iligiouS life and organization are on the verge rbf a great Bolshevistic movement. He is going ijto turn Bolshevik by getting another job, and •Jet his church, presumably, go to grass. The ^warning is that the “churches” are about to become defunct; and then, what in the world shall '•We do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">y The crux of the matter is that other men in </span><span class="font10">?®aore lucrative employment have good automo-|biiles, their families are fed better, are housed ^better, and wear better clothing. And, possibly, ithere is the feeling that other men—not half hto good—are more respected and esteemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">k While the profiteer is blamed for the Bolshevistic tendencies there may be some truth in the thought that the preacher is to blame, too. Bolshevism, an outbreak against time-honored op-' pression by the rulers of the people, inay be the germ of anarchy; and no doubt the underlying cause is the union of church and state, , and the endorsement the church wrongfully .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">gives the state. The fear has' been expressed that the “chrirches” will not awake in time to save the world from the peril that threatens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The deep-seated cause of the restlessness and perplexity which goads the people on their mad rush for something, they know not .exactly ■ what, is the upturning and overpowering of the “kingdoms of this world,” which represent • all the ingenuity of his majesty, the devil—in- ’ sofar as the people can be inveigled into sup- ' porting his schemes. This overturning is done.. by the invisible power of earth’s New Ruler —Christ, for the time has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Times of refreshing” obtain under the new order of things. A one-thousand-year day of jubilee is here, the early preparatory hours of which are used in blasting upon the silver trumpets the message of truth, and in the cries *of the masses for liberty. If the preachers had done their duty, the world would know how ta act and be in expectation of the real Utopia; but now, as a penalty for putting their confidence in a fallible priesthood who are. spiritually blind, the immediate future is laden with forebodings, mistrust and piquant indignation. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Bishop Adroit will soon be consecrated by the -assembly of 300 or more priests, who form the . nucleus of the new church. It is estimated that •-?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">hundreds more of the priests will soon join the <sup>J </sup>new movement. This may be one of the pillars , holding or supporting the “mother” church; if so, the Pope has evidently heard the creaking- of -the moss-covered building. Abbe Adroit said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>in</sup>Some insist that Jesus when on earth was th God and man in completeness. This theory wrong, however. We should never formulate Ei theory concerning God’s plan in direct conxMiction to His plain Word. We should have ifith iir God and in His Word. Faith means &gt;&nbsp;have a knowledge of His Word and then to ■ely upon that Word confidently. The Bible is ic revealed Word of God, given.to man for his instruction: and where plain statements of the Jahle are given, we should take them at their ice value. Following this course, we find that the plan of God everywhere appears harmoni-jus and beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">« ;i’2ijhe adversary takes advantage of an honest desire on the part of some and leads them Into error. Every conscientious and reverential mind desires to honor God. For fear they might ^.dishonor Him, they are easily led into failure -.to- give proper consideration to plain state-^naents of the Bible. Some have been induced believe that should they say that Jesus when son earth was a man and not God, such would be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hi</span><span class="font10"> dishonor to God. We should not permit our-jselves to be-beguiled or misled by sophistry or theories, but should follow the plain teachings $of the Bible and then reach a conclusion in the flight of that revealed Word after a full exami-S<sup>6</sup> nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>ira</sup>The record concerning Jesus’ prehuman existence, His being begotten and His birth, en-itirely disproves the theory that He was incarnated. The Scriptures above cited plainly show &lt;that He was begotten in the womb of a woman, jMary, by the holy spirit, the power, energy or nfluence of Jehovah; that thereafter He was Shorn in the same general manner that other Children are bom of a woman (Luke 2: 9-11); dhat He grew to manhood’s estate and increased <sup>!</sup>in wisdom and stature and in favor with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">d man. (Luke 2: 40, 52) None of these things would have been necessary were He merely an incarnated being, a spirit being inhabiting a Sfeody of flesh. He worked at the carpenter’s abrade until he was thirty years of age, at which (Luke 3: 21-23) Immediately following that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">spent forty days and nights in the wilderness, fasting and studying Jehovah’s plan.

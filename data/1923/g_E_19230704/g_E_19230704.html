<p><span class="font1">A Glimpse at the Current News</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T) EADERS of The Golden Age are aware that we do not follow the practice, common with many periodicals, of glancing superficially at the news of the day, but prefer to take up a subject at a time and give it more thorough study. However, in this issue we depart from our usual custom and notice briefly the items w<sup>T</sup>hich pass through our hands in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, has an article in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">United Mine Workers Journal</span><span class="font10"> reporting that Charles Garland of Boston, a young millionaire, has set aside $800,000, which is being used </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">acquaint the mine workers of America with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">policies and principles of Soviet Russia. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font10">Gompers is believed by many to be in the employ of big business or, at any rate, working in their interest. If this be true, his alarm at the spread of Soviet doctrines among the mine workers is easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, From Cleveland, Ohio, comes the news that a reward of $5,000 will be paid by the sixteen standard railway labor organizations for information respecting the lynching of a railway shopman at Harrison, Arkansas, last January. The statement shows that there is no government in Harrison. Men are assaulted, flogged, and driven from home for expressing sympathy for organized labor. Two former employes of the same railway system, innocent of any crime, were imprisoned at the command of the mob. The murdered man, E. C. Gregor, was accused of burning a trestle which union labor men believe was burned as the result of a defective engine’s dropping live coals upon it. Gregor was not in the city at the time the bridge burned.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Prosperity and the Negro</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19230704_files/g_E_19230704-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">HE United States is having </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">season of great prosperity. Wages are rising; there is a labor shortage. Wisconsin is proposing an unemployment insurance, all employers to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">affected by the Bill except the government and those employing fewer than six persons. On. the fourth day of his forced unemployment the worker begins to receive from the insurance fund one dollar a day. The worker must have worked six months in the state, and must show that he is unable to obtain employment. This is a good time to plan what to do for the workers in times of unemployment. The prospects are there will be plenty of unemployment six months hence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Negroes are again on the march. Ths shortage of labor is again pulling them from the South towards the North. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It is claimed </span><span class="font10">that 32,000 Negro farm-hands </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">Georgia </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">moved </span><span class="font10">north during the past twelve months. It </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">known that 5,000 Negro laborers in North </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Caro</span><span class="font10">lina went north recently in one week, resulting in the shutting down of some fifty highway construction projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thirty-four Negroes have been<sup>f</sup>burned alive in the United States since the ar</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mis</span><span class="font10">tice- The American Committee for the Art School at Fontainebleau, France, refused a scholarship to a talented Negro girl,Augusta Savage, solely ’ because of her color. One of the members of the Committee is a Spanish Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font10">the wages of the workers rise, the cost </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">living rises. The average weekly earnings of New York factory workers were in February seven percent above a year ago, while wholesale prices are eleven percent above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judge Gary, the head of the Steel Trust </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that = </span><span class="font10">but a little while ago was inciting riots and producing anarchy in western Pennsylvania because workmen of the Steel Trust wanted better living conditions, continues to clamor loudly that there is a shortage of common labor ' in the United States. Let the Steel Trust provide suitable wages and proper working hours and working conditions to its employes, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">will have all the employes that it will be to the good of the country for the Trust to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mining Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">EN thousand earloads of powder a year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(Not face powder, but explosives.) That is what </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we use </span><span class="font10">in the United States. This would allow 43,177 pounds to each car, which is all the powder that any car ought to carry. It would make a train eighty miles long. Pennsylvania is in the lead, consuming over ten percent of all the explosives used in the United States. The other mining states follow in the order of their importance, West Virginia, Alabama, Illinois, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">American users of soft coal were charged from one hundred to two hundred percent more for their coal in April, 1923, than was charged them for the same kind of coal in April, 1922, although in the meantime there was no increase in the wages of the coal miners, no increase in freight rates, and no valid excuse for the increased charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The anthracite coal production jogs along at about 250,000 tons for each working day. This is 5,000 cars, with 100,000 pounds on each car, and makes a trainload thirty miles long every day that the mines work. In a hundred days this would make a solid trainload of coal all the way from New York to San Francisco. All this coal comes out of one little section of Pennsylvania, and it is no wonder that the people in that section are greatly interested in seeing that their homes are protected from mine caves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The United Mine Workers of America claim that it was their five months’ strike in the bituminous region, and longer in the anthracite region, that put a stop to the wage-cutting spasm of a year ago. Their 600,000 men refused to work until they had a new contract at the old wage scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">the manufacture of cement the rock is ground until it is so fine that seventy-eight percent of it will pass through a sieve made of bronze wire which contains 40,000 holes to the square inch, and will hold water. It is calculated that the ordinary cement particles are so small that 6,000,000 of them are required to cover one square inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sugar Thieves and Other Thieves</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE sugar thieves have made another haul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only remedy which the Harding administration seems able to suggest is the illegal, inconvenient boycotting of sugar by those </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font10">need to use it for canning purposes. Does </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">not seem strange that the government can </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">all-powerful when it comes to dealing with labor unions, and utterly helpless when it comes to dealing with the piratical New York bankers who engineered this latest stealT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">People are chafing under the high cost of&gt; transportation. They would like to have restored to them the sleeping-car fares which were in use before the war and which in all conscience were then, and would be now, high enough. Indeed, the Pullman Company receives no advantage, the surcharge of fifty percent going to the railroads. The railroads, seeking to retain their ill-gotten advantage, are whining about the extra weight of the Pullman cars, which they claim carry only twenty-eight passengers as against sixty in an ordinary day coach. The other night we counted sixteen upper and sixteen lower berths in a car. The Pullman Company advertises that two persons can sleep comfortably in each of these thirty-tw<sup>T</sup>o berths. Will not some statistician figure out for us how thirty-two berths, with two in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">berth, makes a total capacity of twenty-eight?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also, of late years the railroad companies have hit on a great scheme for increasing their revenue. They not only have raised the passenger fares from two cents a mile to the present high level, but have extra-fare trains between certain points. One road between Chicago and New York has so many “extra-fare” trains that it is difficult to find passage at regular fare. The extra fares are over and above the Pullman charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Secretary of Commerce Hoover has just </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">made </span><span class="font10">a speech carrying a cheerful tone regarding the business outlook, although he urges caution and warns against inflation. It was the last </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pre</span><span class="font10">vious speech of Mr. Hoover’s that brought </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">the five hundred million dollar sugar squeeze, and we were in hopes that he would hereafter keep still; but perhaps that is expecting </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">too </span><span class="font10">much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sensible Legislation and Procedure</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enator Atwood of Columbus, Ohio, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font10">presented to the Legislature a bill providing a jail term and heavy fines for second &gt;&nbsp;offense violators of the Weights and Measures law. To back up his bill he cited several </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pas</span><span class="font10">sages of Scripture, as follows: “Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, ... in weight or in measure.’’ (Leviticus 19: 35) “Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">small.” (Deuteronomy 25:13) “A false balance is abomination to the Lord; but a just weight is his delight.” (Proverbs 11:1) “A just weight and balance are the Lord’s.” (Proverbs 16:11) “</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ar</span><span class="font10">e there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?” (Micah 6:10) Mr. Atwood’s bill was a sensible piece of legislation and he went at it in a sensible way. Not a vote was registered against his bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are signs of returning sanity in the Legislature of New York State, where some </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the vicious laws passed during the period of war mania have been repealed. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">One law was </span><span class="font10">repealed, however, which ought not to have been repealed. New York State has now no law for enforcing the Constitutional provisions against the sale of intoxicating liquors. To have the highest law-making body of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">country pass a law and then to make no provision for carrying out that law is anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Houston, Texas, a grand jury has had the courage and the honesty to return twenty-six indictments against men engaged in terrorizing a community for two years by floggings and other acts of cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the first time in more than three hundred years the Indians of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia have come together in an inter-tribal conference. Although there are only about two thousand Indians affected by this move, yet the plans contemplate an inter-tribal alliance of all the Indians of the North American continent. Such an alliance would have influence with the powers-that-be, and would be able to make itself heard in matters affecting the interests of the native American.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">WOMAN in Oklahoma has presented to the Governor of that state forty-six signed statements showing that in the State Reformatory at Paul’s Valley boys have been whipped by drunken guards until the flesh looked as if it were burned or blistered with a hot iron, that one lad of sixteen committed suicide because of the terrible condition existing in the institution, that one boy suffered a broken ear-drum following a blow over the head, that as many as from a hundred to a hundred and fifty lashes were administered to one boy, yet </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">none were </span><span class="font10">excused from work the next day. One boy‘who had been at the Reformatory eighteen </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">months </span><span class="font10">stated that he had seen eggs but once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font10"> contains an interesting story </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">a laundry solicitor of Scotch-Irish descent </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ar</span><span class="font10">rested in Washington, D. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">C., </span><span class="font10">for attending </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">meeting of “Radicals” and for being </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a “Red.” </span><span class="font10">He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Let me tell you about some of the ‘red’ literature which was ‘seized’: Two copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> (O’Dea </span><span class="font9">ran around with them crying, ‘See the kind of stuff these damned reds are handing out!’), a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Soviet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Russia,</span><span class="font9"> a ticket for ‘Russia Through the Shadows’ (an animated picture passed by the National Board </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Motion Picture Review), and a book on the Bahai revelation. I asked O’Dea why he had not brought my Bible along also. On the third morning of my imprisonment I was brought before an audience of men, and placed upon a platform in the District Building. One of them told me to explain how I became radical.

Thus they were adding to the difficulties of the housing question. They well deserve what they got, and the Department of Justice should give its attention increasingly to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font10">and similar </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font10"> enemies of this country. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">and the claim is made that Germany, in spite of all restrictions, has now an air reserve second only to that of France, with America third. Nearly every country in the world is building up air fleets. The next war will aim to kill all classes, men, women, children, and at any distance from the front. When an airplane can fly from New York to San Diego in one continuous flight of twenty-seven hours and bombers can hit a mark one time out of five, it may be settled that the day of the battleship is past. The United States Government is now planning a flight around the world as one of the next achievements of the army air-service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An American military aviator has flown 243 miles an hour. Today many airplanes can average 200 miles an hour. The French air strength at present consists of 5,000 machines—eight times that of Great Britain. The output of French machines is at a rate of eleven times </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">output of American airplane industries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">That Great Britain still believes in warships seems apparent from the fact that she is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">just </span><span class="font10">about building a $55,000,000 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">naval </span><span class="font10">base at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sin</span><span class="font10">gapore.

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Los</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"> Angeles Examiner</span><span class="font10"> tells us (and we believe it tells the truth) that the single great State of Toxas, if it were properly drained, irrigated, plowed, fertilized, and intensively cultivated, could feed the entire population of the earth as it is today. Another paper draws attention to the fact that there is sufficient room on Staten Island (one of the five boroughs of the City of New York) to provide standing room for all the people in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An impression has been widely spread that the Germans have paid practically nothing in reparations. The facts are that in the years 1918-1922 the Germans paid 42,780,000,000 gold marks. A gold mark is worth $.2375. The total amount in our money is $10,269,000,000. This is a German statement, and includes all payments to December 31,1922, as well as all property seized by the Allies or turned over to them. It is obvious that the more there is seized </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">Germany’s working capital in the way of property, the less Germany can pay hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">deferring to the French refusal to accept Germany’s offer of $7,500,000,000 cash or any sum above that amount which an international commission might agree that she could and ought to pay, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“What the French are after today is an economic and militaristic despotism in Europe, and they propose to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9">the despots. They do not care a whit for the sufferings they are indicting by this policy upon Switzerland and Holland and Sweden and Norway and other innocent bystanders. They care not at all that their keeping all Europe in turmoil is endangering the safety and stability and the prosperity of every other nation in Europe. As Sir Philip Gibbs says, they ‘intend to smash Germany, and if we smash Europe in the process so much the worse’ for Europe. They are perfectly willing to continue to starve women, and children and to earn if need be the title of baby-killers, which a few years ago they bestowed with horror on the Germans. They are going right ahead, conscious that with their enormous army and unmatched air fleet they can impose their will upon England or anybody else. Talk about the German threat of world domination I If it ever existed ..utside of Allied propaganda, it was small compared to the menace of domination of Europe by Trance today. For Americans the humiliating thing about it all is not only that innocent American boys gave their lives to the number of 100,000 to produce this state of affairs, but that in the White House and State Department there is no leadership, moral or political, no one to call a conference to put an end to a situation which everybody must admit, whether he supports the French, the English, or the German position, menaces the foundations of civilization in Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pope, League, and Jew</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T^HE Pope has refused to make a statement of what lie and King George of England talked about when the latter monarch waited upon him on May 9. The Popo is planning to call a church council in 1925, and the Catholic press is claiming that the world-wide kingdom of Christ with the Pope as His earthly representative will be established in that year. This is a retreat from their former position, wherein they claimed for centuries that the Pope already ruled thus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The League of Nations is still a vital question in England. The president of the Board of Education, speaking recently at Leicester, England, made the statement that “the policy of the League is the policy of the British Empire.” Throughout Britain the word is going forth in leaflets distributed far and wide that “the failure of the League means the uprooting of civilization, and the utter destruction of humanity. The next war will be inconceivably more hideous and terrible that the last. Alan-kind, unable to endure the agony of horror, will turn to anarchy. The world will be devastated from end to end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jews continue to make progress in Palestine. A local rabbi has referred to the recent visit of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in these words;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The romance of twenty centuries, the rehabilitation of Palestine as a homeland for the oppressed, seems now to approach realization. Millions of dollars have already been spent and many more millions will be devoted to reanimating the old home of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jew</span><span class="font9"> and making it again a center whence shall go forth inspiration to the Jews of all the world, help and guidance in the solution of the world’s problems.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE British </span><span class="font10">Government seems to have more trouble in bluffing the Russian Government than any other government on which this frequent recourse of British statesmanship has been tried. Just as Britain is about to determine what it will do to Russia for failure to obey its orders, one of the Russian officials dashes two thousand miles by airplane from Moscow to London and sits in the gallery of the House of Commons so that he can hear the debate. On the same day Trotzky, the military leader of the Russians, who has defeated all the armies which Air. Churchill and other British statesmen have wholly or partly financed and sent against him, announces that he is ready for war; and the Russian people, angered by the murder of one of their statesmen at the Lausanne Conference, are eager to enter the fray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">England has other worries. The Labor members in the House of Commons have horrified the old-timers by singing a revolutionary song called “The Red Flag” on the floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Despite the unprecedented prosperity of the United States in the past few months and its tremendous accumulation of wealth, London has regained its position as principal clearing house for international financial transactions. Its interest rates are more stable and lower than in New York. It is the great investment center of the world, as New York is the great speculative center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Pan-American Conference in Santiago, Chile, is pronounced a complete failure. The conference was unable to bring about any agreement for the reduction of armaments and was unable to convince Uncle Sam of the folly of pursuing an imperialistic policy in the Caribbean Sea and Central America. It seems quite clear that there will be no official Western Hemisphere League of Nations.</span></p>

Tea contains tannin, which dries up the tissues and shrivels the face. It produces wakefulness, irritability, and neuralgia. Coffee retards digestion, causes sclerosis of the liver and degeneracy of the kidneys, having an effect similar to that produced by Small doses of opium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inasmuch, however, as people persist in using coffee, many may wish to know how to take out coffee stains, especially from delicate materials. This can be done by brushing the spot with pure glycerine, rinsing in lukewarm water, and pressing on the wrong side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tobacco was abandoned as a drug because so many deaths resulted from its use, even when applied externally. Nicotine dulls the nerve centers and injuriously a (Teets every tissue, fluid, and organ of the body. It causes the loss of the delicate, bluish-white translucency of the tissue of the eyes, and sometimes causes blindness. A small part of the stain of tobacco smoke placed on the tongue of a cat causes the death of the cat in a few moments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The curse of vivisection still goes on. Doctor Doyen of Rheims, still living, after removing from a patient a cancer of the breast, grafted a portion of the cancer upon the other breast, at that time perfectly healthy. In a few months the operation was a success; cancer developed in the second breast. In experimenting </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font10">the infants under his care, Dr. A. H. Wentworth, Senior Assistant Physician to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In</span><span class="font10">fants’ Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, punctured the spinal canals of twenty-nine children, five years and less of age. Some of them were punctured four times. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font10">these twenty-nine children fourteen died on the day of the puncture, and all but two within a very few days. After forty-five punctures, he admitted that the experiments had no value. At the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Dr. Roberts Bartho-low drove red-hot needles an inch and a half into the brain of a feeble-minded girl, Mary Rafferty. The experiment was not a success, as the poor girl died shortly in the greatest agony.</span></p>

The business of pleading the cause of the oppressed is one of the noblest in the world, but it requires courage, it requires honesty, it requires self-sacrifice; for the inducements of the profession are all in the opposite direction. Abraham Lincoln would never take a case unless he had first assured himself </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the justice of his position; and then no matter how poor the client, he put all his great ability and his great heart into the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> real risk to itself The Goldew Age on ' September 13, 1922, published the thrilling story of Isaac Herman Schwartz respecting the virtual homicide of Ned Thompson in the p leased-convict lumber camp of the $800,000 Putnam Lumber Company of Eau Claire, Wis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">k</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">consin, and Jacksonville, Florida. The story -gave the details of the flogging of Schwartz i almost to death, when he was so ill that he was unable to stand. Funds to pay for his release 3 from the terrible penalty imposed for stealing J a ride on a freight train came just in time to -save his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A pretty howdy-do was created by the publication of that article. It helped to bring to light the murder by flogging of young Martin Tabert of North Dakota in the same camp, with all the nice details of how the flogging boss, Captain Higginbotham, put his foot on the young man’s neck to keep him from writhing, while the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">boss </span><span class="font10">finished the job of beating </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10"> with an eight- jJ pound strap because Tabert was too sick </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">a w<sup>T</sup>ork at top speed ten hours a day standing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in |</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">water over his shoe-tops. It was a fine example of modern business efficiency—an $800,000 example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The officers of the Putnam Lumber Company, and the stockholders, are probably nice people, church members, anxious to uphold our civilization, and to keep it from getting into the terrible condition of things in some of the European countries. The flogging boss is one of the means by which they hope, indirectly, to keep the “kingdom of God” intact. Boys should not steal rides on freight trains; if they do, inasmuch as a perfectly good &quot;hell” awaits them hereafter for not being officers or stockholders </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">some one of the great corporations which furnish stability to our civilization, it is the duty of such corporation, through its lawyers, to arrange that such boys shall have a taste of hell in advance, and incidentally keep some of the officers and stockholders comfortably seated in their soft seats. So the convict-leasing system was worked out by lawyers in the.long ago and would be going in good shape yet, were it not for such offensive publications as The Got,den Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The publication of the Schwartz article got us into hot water. Oh, yes! But when you have had your feet in hot water for a sufficient length of time, you can put in a little more hot water and rather enjoy it. One of our subscribers, a most estimable gentleman, who was so offended that he really wanted to get us into trouble for publishing it, sent a marked copy to the governor of Florida, and only regretted that he did not have other copies which, so he intimated, he would have enjoyed placing where they might have done us the most harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the trouble was that the Schwartz article told the truth; and by the time it got into the governor's hands he was in hot water himself with the governor of North Dakota and a delegation of North Dakota lawyers (honest ones) and judges who visited the state and began an agitation against the $800,000 efficiency system that had hitherto worked so well. Now the flogging boss has been indicted for murder, and the lawyer of the Putnam Lumber Company has the dirty job of trying to save his neck and to make things look as well as possible for the officers and stockholders of the Putnam Lumber .Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Already suggestions are beginning to appear in the papers that, after all, the Lumber Camp was a pretty good home, that Captain Higginbotham was only joking when he whipped these boys to death; that he lightly hit them only </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">few taps anyway (though some of the witnesses said not less than 125); and that the murdered boys, instead of being buried in the water, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font10">given “Christian” burial in a real nice private cemetery which the Putnam Lumber Company keeps on its premises for all patients who die </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">accident or otherwise while at their sanitarium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The despatches indicate that some of these wholesome suggestions </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">emanate from the law</span><span class="font10">yer of the Putnam Lumber Company. Probably he is a college graduate. Very likely </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he has had </span><span class="font10">a post-graduate course in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">law. </span><span class="font10">Undoubtedly </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font10">is a church member. Without question he </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">anxious to uphold our Twentieth Century </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sniv-</span><span class="font10">elization, and without the least shadow of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">doubt he does already have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a poor opinion of </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">will have a worse one </span><span class="font10">when he reads this little skit. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Woe unto you lawyers!—</span><span class="font10">Luke 11:46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On April 20th, with but one dissenting vote, the Florida Legislature put an end to the leasing of convicts to the lumber companies </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of that </span><span class="font10">state, which means that no more men are to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">flogged to death in the prison camps of that commonwealth. The State Senate also took another matter in hand: It ousted J. R. Jones from the office of sheriff of Leon county. Jones was charged with securing “$20 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">head” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">the Putnam Lumber Company for every convicted prisoner he turned over to their lumber camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the trial of Sheriff Jones the camp physician, Dr. T. C. Jones, testified before the special legislative committee that Tabert, the North Dakota boy, died from other causes and that he was unaware of any condition prevailing in the camp that would justify prisoners: complaining. The Legislative committee recommended in its report that the State Board of Medical Examiners investigate Dr. Jones “to the end that the medical profession be purged of a seemingly unworthy member.” Representative Kennerly of the committee said that the lumber company and its officials made a display of armed force to frighten a Negro ex-convict who offered to show the investigators the spot in the pine swamp where Tabert died and where other eonvicts had buried the body.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the most characteristic features of modern industrialism has been the growth of various organizations for the promotion and protection of wage earners. No one can gainsay </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">fact </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the rise of trade-unionism; for it is written on the pages of history over a period of 140 years. While in its earliest stages the movement was hardly discernible except to those most nearly interested, yet it was not long before its influence was felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The great opponent of labor has always been capital. These two giant forces, which are so dependent on each other, have never in history formed an alliance. Many efforts have been made to find a solution and bring about a peaceful state, but they can no more mingle than oil and water. Both sides are working for one selfish end, and that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The good old rule, The simple plan, That they shall get Who have the power And they shall keep Who can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Capital naturally has always had the best of it, for “money is the sinew of war”; and as capital is “that part of wealth which is devoted to obtaining further wealth,” and as it does not matter how wealth is piled up or who suffers in the struggle providing the capitalist gets the profit, it is no wonder that the worker always had the worse end of the fight. But against all obstacles he has made progress. Concessions have been made grudgingly by the powers in control; the worker has had to battle against many influences—ecclesiastical, financial, and political. The ones to whom he has naturally looked for help, the preachers and teachers of the church systems, have always sidestepped the issue, and at the bidding of the financial and political rulers have used their influence against the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One would naturally concede the exceptions that prove the rule; for during these years of struggle for better conditions men and women </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">all classes and vocations have stepped out boldly on the side of the worker. During the time when things looked darkest for the worker, when the common people began to realize their needs, and when the great struggle for freedom was starting, from 1781 onwards, at the time when legislators ■were passing laws in England to imprison those pioneers oi' the inalienable rights of all to live and have their share in the good things which they have helped to produce, Ebenezer Elliott wrote these lines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“When wilt Thou save the people? 0 God of Mercy, when?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not kings and lords, but nations;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not thrones and crowns, but men.</span></p>

Had the poet been living but a few years later, when the time had come for the light to shine and for men to get an understanding of God’s wonderful plan of salvation, his heart would have been gladdened by such promises as that of Zechariah 8:8, in which through the Prophet Jehovah declares: “They shall be my people, and I -will be their God”; for in the Golden Age no man will need to say to hia neighbor: “Know thou the Lord.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">CONDITIONS of labor at the beginning of the nineteenth century were indeed bad. In the year 1780 we have record that the bookbinders of London, England, were working fourteen hours daily, and were evidently the first to form themselves into a society or guild with the endeavor to better their working conditions. In 1786 we find that their hours were reduced to thirteen daily, the first concession to a trade-union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1790 the hours of labor in England were practically unlimited, children working as many as fifteen hours a day. By 1794 the London bookbinders, who were evidently the union with the “pep” in those days, had reduced their hours to twelve daily. This success evidently scared the masters; for by 1799 a bill was put through Parliament making every form of trade combinations unlawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1800 another bill was introduced, and passed in 1801, which made it unlawful for workers to combine for the purpose of discussing an increase in wages, and which also provided punishment for those who refused to work for the amount of wages that the master considered it right to give. When we read that earlier economists such as Adam Smith taught that the price of labor should afford the worker neither more nor less than a mere subsistence, one can imagine what the toiler of that day was up against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1820 the London Society of Compositors, who were then a Friendly society, requested that the masters of the printing trades receive a deputation to consider the wage question. The masters expressed their willingness to meet the delegates, and five compositors were sent as the deputation from the union. These five men were afterward arrested and sentenced to two years imprisonment on the charge of conspiracy; and one year later five bookbinders were imprisoned for the same reason. So the struggle continued until 1824, when a bill was passed through the English Parliament repealing the combination laws and giving tradeunions the right to organize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By 1830 we find the Labor movement getting into its stride; organizations began to be prominent in the United States, and were becoming powerful in England. Persecution, however, was still in order; for in that year Richard Oastler began an agitation for a ten-hour day for factory workers, and suffered imprisonment. Uis work bore fruit; for many prominent men began interesting themselves in labor problems — Sir John Ilobhouse and Lord Shaftesbury in England putting through laws for the reducing of hours of labor for girls, children, and young boys under eighteen. In the United States, in 1840, President Martin Van Buren declared a ten-hour day for the [Navy Yard and other public works; and many other industries fell into line. In 1847 the ten-hour day became law in England, and the following year France followed suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By this time the trades-unions had become popular among the workers, and their membership was being numbered by tens of thousands. Financially also they were becoming very strong, and the result was that they became dictatorial in their attitude toward the employers. The latter formed masters’ associations for their own protection, and strikes and lockouts became numerous. The nine-hour day now became the bone of contention; but by 1872 the skilled workmen of England had won their point; for the majority were working a nine-hour day. The Trades-Union Act of 1871 had given a legal status to the unions; and both sides, capital and labor, being fully organized, the fight became more intense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Free education had become a great factor in the lives of the workers, and with greater light and knowledge they saw more clearly the oppression under which they and their forefathers had been suffering. Dissatisfaction with their conditions increased, and many measures were brought before the House of Commons to advance the cause of labor. The lobbies were crowded with representatives of various labor organizations seeking interviews with their local members endeavoring to further their cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Employers sitting on both sides of the house fought these issues bitterly, and started a movement of their own to revive the ten-hour day. The result was more strikes; and it is interesting here to note that a strike generally affects more than the workers involved and, in most cases, that at least thirty percent more of other trades are affected and can be numbered among the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Throughout the history of the trades-union movement right up to 1919-20 the fight was of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">seesaw nature. But the representatives of labor were not to be denied; and factory laws for the betterment of working conditions and for the preserving of life and limbs of employes were passed, also laws for safeguarding the wages of the worker, making it illegal to stop any part of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">person’s earnings without the consent of the one involved or through a garnishee order. To tabulate the successes and defeats of labor during this time would require a volume; for the workers in every part of the civilized world were agitating for better working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One outstanding event was the address of the deposed Kaiser of Germany to the parading troops, warning them that, if necessary, at his command they would have to fire on their own countrymen. The Labor-Socialist movement was getting so powerful in Germany that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">had even gotten under the skin of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;all </span><span class="font10">powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor, and in fact the workers as a whole, has always been an unknown quantity to the economist. Labor has a power the extent of which it has never been possible to fathom; and.it has upset many carefully laid plans of capitalistic corporations. Its chief and practically only weapon of offense and defense is the strike and boycott; and the endeavors of the leaders of capital have ever been to find ways and means to break or offset this powerful weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the years of the World War the worker came into his own. He was called upon to do the fighting, to supply munitions, food, and clothing; and nothing was too good for him. Those who were left to run the factories could have practically any wages they liked to ask for. The common people found that they were a very necessary part of the world of mankind, and began to appreciate themselves at their worth or, one should say, at the value the employer put on their services, owing to abnormal conditions. Then came the slump, and with such suddenness that the people were unprepared for the bad times. Some had used common sense and salted away some of their excess earnings; but the great majority had spent&quot; as it came, expecting the good times to last indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was soon evident that 1920 was to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">bad year; and with the stoppage of factories unemployment became prevalent, wage reductions were put into force and many strikes were caused thereby. The power of trade-unionism had reached its peak by the Fall of 1919. Although represented strongly in Parliament and Congress, and with large surplus of funds, yet the trades-unions were not powerful enough to hold up wages at the time of the decline in 1920; nor have they been able to force increases since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The evidence of the decline of trade-unionism is strong. The working people are as strong as ever, if not stronger; and their strength will 'doubtless be shown in the near future; but the organized element is weakening. If these organizations have been so strong and have achieved so many reforms, securing better conditions and wages for the worker, why is it, at this time when politically and financially their position seemed so secure, that a decline has set in?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Henry Ford in an interview aboard his </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">yaeht ' </span><span class="font10">at Clayton, N. Y., on August 9, 1922, gave his view of this question when he asserted that the financial kings are responsible for big strikes. ■ He further stated that they are behind these walkouts, as they are behind every disturbance in the ranks of labor or capital; that all unions were engineered by capitalists, who knew </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">men could be more easily handled as units than as individuals. Mr. Ford’s statement is practically right, as events during the past three i years have shown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">union in 1920. In the course of his speech to -the membership he made the statement that the <sup>i? </sup>Manufacturers’ Association of New York had </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a -</span><span class="font10">special fund of five million dollars for the pur- t pose of breaking the unions; and he warned </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font10">i that this money would be used for bribing those </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A, </span><span class="font10">officials of unions who were willing to use their influence against their fellow workers. The dis- 1 astrons strikes of the past three years seem to &nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">show that this fund and many others like it &nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">have had the expected effect; for no success &gt;&nbsp;has come to the worker. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the end of 1919 wages have been cut from twelve to fifty percent with an average of j twenty-five percent. Mr. Clynes, Labor member 1 in the British House of Commons, in a recent 1 speech stated that wages of the worker have been forced down below the prewar purchasing value. Working hours in many cases have been | lengthened; and in smaller factory towns that | are not organized, conditions are very bad, as | bad as fifty years ago and with the strenuous S work of keeping pace with modern machinery ;a to make them harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one Canadian factory town today, men are ’ a working sixty to sixty-six hours per week at a ?g wage of twenty-five cents per hour; and girls ’ the same length of time for one dollar per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet the same company which employs this labor . has an American factory in which the forty- &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">four-hour week is in force and the wages paid &nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">are on the generous side. The employes in the .■ 1 latter ease, however, are working in a district <sup>; </sup>where labor has always been able to organize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The labor-unions still have some prestige; j but with each defeat it lessens, and the unions in most cases can hut bear the blame. One remembers the walkout of the New York printers and pressmen in 1920—a quite legitimate act op their part under the then existing circumstances. But these men were outlawed by their Internationals, and their headquarter executives used their funds and authority to defeat their own members. This can be recognized as the beginning of the decline. It showed capital the weak spot in labor’s ranks, and we know now to what advantage they have used that knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have seen the disastrous strikes of the miners, railroad men, machinists, and engineers in England, bringing defeat for the unions and depleting the funds not only of the strikers but also of most other labor organizations which went to their assistance. The result is that the unions, having no funds to fight with, have had to make the best terms possible for themselves when new contracts have been under discussion. So wage cuts have been universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are the workers satisfied with the situationT Whoever knows the average English worker can give the answer to that question. Maybe one would not be able to decide from casual meetings and ordinary conversation. But get inside the shops; and if one gets the chance to listen in at the noon hour or odd times when a few get together, one would say that he had heard sounds like the rumblings of a coming storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the United States and Canada we have seen many strong organizations in the labor world go down in defeat. The ill-advised strike of the printing trades for the forty-four-liour week is a case in point. This conflict which started in both countries in June, 1921, is still being fought out, with the unions on the losing side. The bookbinders and pressmen have practically owned defeat, but the Typos, though still in the fight, have failed in their object to weaken production and so force the employers to come to terms; for of the twenty-four leading cities of the United States we find only four producing over ninety percent on. the forty-four-hour basis, and two producing eighty percent. Of the other eighteen cities there are nine producing over ninety percent on the open-shop fortyeight-hour basis, and the others arc averaging seventy-five percent. Tn Canada the printing centers are overwhelmingly open shop on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">forty-eight-hour basis, and production is found &lt;5 to be equal to the amount of work offered. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The • </span><span class="font10">International Typographical Union has a treas- j ury fund of $3,500,000, but it does not seem to get the members anywhere. Their striking </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ad</span><span class="font10">herents get good strike pay; but every week -finds them losing in other ways—in self-respect &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and prestige, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a great difference in the way strikes are handled today compared with those of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">past. We read daily in the press of acts of ’ violence on the part of striking railroad work- -ers, miners, and other organizations that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">fighting for the right to live. They </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">received </span><span class="font10">their lesson and example from the treatment </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the steel workers, the brutality of which moved _ even some of the leaders of ecclesiasticism </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to ' </span><span class="font10">action; and one can foresee this phase of labor . trouble getting worse as time goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The worker is being irritated by the constant ' cutting into his rights. Many of the extra conveniences that were installed in large factories ’ during war-time have been removed — rest 7 rooms, hospitals, bath, dining rooms, etc. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Th® </span><span class="font10">employer feels that there is now no need </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">make special provision to induce workers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">stay with him and is looking forward to the time when, as shown in a cartoon of recent date, • * he will have the worker eating out of his hand; -for, as another of these one-time advocates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of -</span><span class="font10">the “big brother” system puts it, ’ “a hungry i worker is a willing worker.” The student </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of ~ </span><span class="font10">economics can see the decline of trade-union- ; ism. A writer in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Chronicle</span><span class="font10"> (Eng- ~ land) used the expression in his article: “When J; Trade-Unions Were in Power,” implying something in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What, then, has the worker to look forward to? Some writers are giving the assurance that i the elections will achieve all that organized la- ' bor has failed to do. Doubtless the, worker will &quot;&nbsp;use his last weapon, the ballot, and will fill the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font10">Commons in London and the Congress in Wash- * ington with those who promise to further his 5 demands. But one can also read and realize that capital is well aware of this plan of cam- ' &quot;J paign on the part of labor and is making its . plans to defeat it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If labor would close </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font10">its </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ranks and present </span><span class="font10">’2 a solid fighting front to the forces of capitalism, J* a sweeping victory would speedily be assured -to them; but the leaders, especially of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Inter- </span><span class="font10">-3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. -Si national bodies, have always rejected any suggestion of the amalgamation of all sections of labor into one solid organization. The leaders of capital knov»<sup>T</sup> that they could not hope to win against the solid mass of labor, and have centered all their forces on individual organizations, using their power to force strikes at the most convenient time to insure an issue successful for the capitalistic side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If this state of things were to continue, it would be a dreary future of hopelessness the toiler would have in view. But God has prom- ‘ ised through His Holy Word that this shall not always be; for by His prophet He says that He will loose the bands of wickedness, and undo the heavy burden, and let the oppressed go free, and that every yoke of bondage shall be broken.—Isaiah 58: 6.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Save the High Schools from Barbarism </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Irene Davis</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10"> PASTOR in the southern part of the country writes in a recent Christian -weekly of the dangers that threaten the young people of this and coming generations, through the dance problem in our public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pastor tells that some time ago he spent an evening in the home of a distinguished professor emeritus of an American University, and in the course of the conversation this experienced educator stated that he was one of a committee selected to pass upon the merits of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">number of competitive essays from writers scattered over the United States, the purpose of the essays being to suggest methods of dealing with immoralities existing in the public schools of the country. So shocking had these immoralities become that a prize had been offered for the best essay telling how to deal with them. Since that time conditions do not seem to have improved, but rather grown worse. “So serious and alarming, indeed, have these conditions become, at least in some communities,” said he, “that I am convinced that the high schools of our cities are threatening to paganize America.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He rightly deplores the dance craze which has struck our city high schools amidship, and which is producing results that might be expected. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap.” The published news growing out of this condition is often unfit to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He said that in one city three hundred mothers had opened war on immorality among high school students, “booze parties and dances.” He stated that in another city the police authorities have taken steps to regulate the highschool club dances. Dancing is the order of the day in some high schools, being a part of the regular school program. “Mixers” are had from time to time. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font10"> high-school dance party was held one night, and two mothers were talking of it the next morning. “My daughter did not come home until three o’clock in the morning,” said one mother, “but I slept well because </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I -</span><span class="font10">knew that one of the boys would chaperone her home.” “Ah!” replied the other, “I could not sleep for that very reason, but waited up until my little girl came home; and I think it high time that all mothers were awake on this allimportant theme of their daughter’s salvation for body, mind and soul.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The principal in one high school charges that some of the girls openly practise things in matters of dress that border on the indecent, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font10">indeed they are not positively so. From </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one ’ </span><span class="font10">city comes the report that certain high-school boys and girls had indulged in an “outrageous bacchanalian orgy.” “Cheek to cheek” dancing had been openly practised. Doubtless these instances could be multiplied, but these are sufficient to show the drift of things. Another deplores the atheistic; teachings in certain high . schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Someone has said that the general craze for the dance in its extreme and indecent forms seems to be a part of the nation’s inheritance from the late war; and that the tendency toward • the wickedness of Sodom </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">its immorality </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">the natural outcome; that this was why </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font10">permitted so many in decadent Europe to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">destroyed. “The nation that forgets God </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font10">perish.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A French Senator recently gave the solemn warning that “France will fall as Rome fell unless there is a regeneration of morals.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">pointed out that the latest revue in the biggest music hall in Paris had ten naked women </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">one scene. The Senator declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This city is plastered with immoral theatrical </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">port-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230704_files/g_E_19230704-10.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:34pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">ere. The dancing clubs are filled with half-dressed women. Even the street costumes of women are immoral. Women who come from the best families walk in the streets in indecent gowns, flaunting their physical charms. Unless all this is stopped, France will fall just as Some fell and for the same reason.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pastor points out that the time to call </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">halt is when there is a fighting chance to remedy the situation, and not after the texture of our civilization has been corrupted and weakened by rampant worldliness and unblushing shamelessness. If the tendencies in our high schools, pointed out above, continue unchecked, they will increase in strength until they become dominant; and then indeed the stream of our national life will become hopelessly corrupted near its source. There will be no desire for pure reading or spiritual literature. Even now, in order to hold their own, the denominational organs are paying all they can afford to writers of stories that will entertain, amuse, and please the pleasure-loving side of the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here are some of the remedies that are suggested :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span><span class="font9"> “Make </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">clear and. definite and insistent call </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for tome of </span><span class="font9">our finest young people to choose teaching in the public schools as a life profession. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is high tim# </span><span class="font9">for us to look upon this form of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">service, </span><span class="font9">not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as a Bid# </span><span class="font9">issue, nor as a stepping-stone to something </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">else, bul </span><span class="font9">rather as a high and holy task worthy of the best </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">talent </span><span class="font9">and the best energies of our choice young men </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">women. We need Christian colleges for the training </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Christian teachers for our public schools just as imperatively as we need them for the training of minister# and missionaries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. “Dare to utter insistent and repeated warning# against the dangers that are threatening the students of our high schools. As we plan, great things in other directions, let us not carelessly allow the stream of our national life to be hopelessly poisoned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. “Demand of local boards of education that dancing be eliminated from the public schools. If parents wish their children to dance in spite of all the warnings that are given, they can send them to private dancing masters. But there are thousands of parents who do not want their children to learn to dance. -Under the prevailing arrangements their children are virtually forced to dance or suffer social ostracism in school life. Public school authorities are under no obligation to foster </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">practice in the schools that is, or was until recently, condemned by nearly all of the churches in the land. Therefore let vigorous protest be made. And if this protest is unheeded, carry it into court as has already been done in one case with success.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Worship of Precedent </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Cyril Williams</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font10">AN in general is naturally given to worship. He </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font10"> worship somebody or something. The world is in trouble. The earth is full of trouble. Can any give the reasons why this is sol We think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perhaps one of the most fruitful causes for present troubles is found in the fact that mankind’s proclivity for worship is, and always has been, turned in the wrong direction. It is recorded in the Bible that men worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator. For over six thousand years mankind have not known the Creator. Not knowing Him they have not been able to serve Him. It is not strange therefore that man’s penchant for worship has found a ready outlet in his adoration of the creature. In serving the creature he has consistently served and worshiped idols. Of these idols Precedent is one of the greatest. As a mighty ruler it has swayed the hearts and minds of men in every age. Its rulership is in no wise abated in our own. Hoary with age, Precedent has throughout the ages played a great part in the subjugation of the people. Binding its tentacles tighter and tighter round the mentality of its subjects it has forced all to worship and pay homage — through habit. Webster, defines Precedent as: “Something previously . said or done; serving as an example to be followed; a parallel case in the past.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mankind, roughly divided into two great see-tions,have bowed down in adoration before this fetish, this joss, this god. These two great sections we call the Civil and the Ecclesiastical. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font10">take </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">brief look at the Civil. Governments come and governments go, but Precedent runs </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">forever. Does one government come into power upon the ruins of another, does </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a new one </span><span class="font10">rise Phoenix fashion from the ashes of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font10">predecessor, it still must be swayed by the acts and methods of the past! In a striking manner thia is to be seen in the courts of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">law. Under </span><span class="font10">the civil administration these courts carry out the function of justice (T). Someone has broken . the law. The stage is set. Argument follows argument, while the small morsel of flesh </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">blood (the defendant) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tossed like a shuttlecock </span><span class="font10">from side to side tries, most times in vain, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">follow the seemingly endless labyrinth of the legal mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">iir &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But listen: “My Lord, in the case of so-and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O so </span><span class="font10">tried before Judge Wiseacre at such-and-such a place we have a precedent covering this point.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gone is that equity which should judge the offender and we have this god “Precedent&quot; enthroned. One can almost see (he can certainly feel) the awe which seizes the ministers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the crown as their favorite joss is elevated and adored. What matters it if on really moral grounds the poor shivering wretch in the dock could be given the benefit of the doubt<sup>1</sup>? It matters not. Our god “Precedent&quot; has spoken. To extend mercy would only place on record another precedent, and a merciful precedent is dangerous. Of course, this is not always the case; but many times human flesh and blood has been imprisoned and oftentimes destroyed, that the hungry maw of Precedent might be filled and the dignity of the established order perpetuated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And what shall we say of the Ecclesiastical section? Is this not the stronghold of Precedent? Verily. The average ecclesiastical mind has truly been likened to the oyster. It opens when it has a mind to do so. That, in the ecclesiastic’s case, is not often. One approaching with a new thought would have to wield the crowbar I Throughout the many-centuricd night ' of sin, men have worshiped mostly as their fathers did before them. Observe the church class of our day! How many nominal churchgoers attend their respective churches from personal conviction ? Not many. Ask the Roman Catholic how he managed to become a Catholic. If he is honest he will invariably reply: “Why, mother was a Catholic.” He does not think it strange that he is a Catholic. Ask a Presbyterian the same question. &quot;Why, father was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presbyterian.” Of course he was; and so they</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all go on in their blind worship of their favorite</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">And yet these self-same people hold up their hands in holy horror at the heathen-ancestor-</span></p>

They dress -well and above all they </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font10"> well, and so in the name of Precedent they are hailed by an apos- ' tate clergy as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font10"> Christians. They are &quot;pil- . lars” of the church. They </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font10"> been called &quot;&nbsp;caterpillars—crawlers. Precedent has made it possible for them to be welcomed into the ~ churches of today. They have always been wel- -come in the nominal church of the past. Jesus said of the Pharisees of His day that they loved ■ the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief ~ seats in the synagogues. Today there are Pharisees in the pulpits, and Pharisees in the pews; ; and both are true to Precedent—their idol. &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again, in Luke 11:42, Jesus said of thia , class: “But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye •= tithe mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God.” And they did and still do this because of their love of Precedent. How deeply is the worship of this fetish implanted in the human heart is seen from even a cursory study of the home life .■ of the people. Take mother! She brings the ■ bairns up mainly on the ideas she has learned from Precedent. These ideas were given to mother by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font10"> mother. Her mother got them -from her mother, and her mother’s mother got '. them from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font10"> mother. So it is at least plain where they did come from. And father, too. He unconsciously treats Tommy as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font10"> father J treated </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">him.</span><span class="font10"> And the same was true of fathers father’s father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We notice in passing, the morals of the rising , generation. They are not high. Can Precedent have anything to do with this question? Alas! -Precedent lies at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">root</span><span class="font10"> of the matter. The j lack of knowledge along sex lines can and must J be laid at the parents’ door. In their blind _ worship of their ancestors’ ideas they have 1 failed to enlighten their offspring on this vital j-point. Has not Precedent manifested itself in * the “hush-hush” policy?

<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Land-Values Money Again</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font10"> Golden Age’s item on the foregoing subject elicited the following comment from the author of the pamphlet which was under consideration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The foregoing is a fair sample of the reasoning that flows from the brain of the newspaper editor of the present day when he discusses topics relating to the subject of money! It illustrates the fact that even a highly educated scholar cannot intelligently discuss a subject that he doesn’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Incompetency to discuss finance is so apparent in this criticism that we shall not disprove all the silly assertions with which it abounds. There is but one allegation in the effusion to which it will be necessary to reply in order to show the critic’s utter lack of monetary knowledge!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We refer to the statement that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“'The pamphleteer imagines that this would be a money secured by wealth behind it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The author of the measure does not ‘imagine’ what he is accused of imagining! What he imagines and demonstrates to be true is, that absolute money does not need to be ‘secured by wealth behind if ! He shows that legalized currency, endowed by sovereignty with legal power to discharge contract obligations becomes, like metallic coins, the most available and desirable form of riches known!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;In predicting the dire consequences that would follow if Uncle Sam should conclude to monetize enough durable wealth to obviate the use of bank credit in commercial dealings, our critic says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“‘The effect would be to run up all land values by forty percent. Land would be bought by speculators at a figure to net them a profit on the forty percent of currency, to be then issued to them at their request?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;In his eagerness to demolish, summarily, so radical a proposal, the editor of The Golden Age has reached a hasty conclusion and indulges in unwarranted speculation. He does not say, for example, of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">whom</span><span class="font9"> speculators would be able to buy land at a figure that would afford them the advantage he says they would deviva,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the contrary he assumes that the 'speculators’ he has in mind would be crazy enough—if given the opportunity—to pay $1,000 for a piece of land because, under the proposed financial system, they could get $400 on it for an unlimited period at a nominal rate of interest. This prediction is oh a par -with the academic reasoning in relation to money that characterizes the editorials ■ of the entire New York press. This assertion cannot be successfully refuted!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Our critic admits that one of his objections could be obviated by making the money issue a first lien on the land, but to this provision he says: 'The citizen would object.<sup>1</sup> We are not informed why the citizen would object to so rational an arrangement; why he would be unwilling to give in exchange for money a first lien on his land, as The Holden Bill provides, when the lien does not bear interest and does not mature so long as a nominal charge for making the system self-sustaining is kept up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The lien is proposed—not for the purpose of giving value to the certificates, but merely to limit the issue and to insure prompt payment of the nominal tax that is levied for the purpose of making the constructive measure self-supporting. Productive land is utilized in the interest of society: to regulate the volume and to prevent fraudulent and unjustifiable issues!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is proper for The Gol-uek Age first to square itself with the truth by acknowledging that it was in error in assuming to discern the mind of the writer; and to acknowledge that, as he says, he did not imagine that currency of the kind he advocates would be money secured by wealth behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It continues, however, to be our belief that such a plan would open the door to the influx of certain very serious conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the government should issue money to the extent of forty percent of the valuation of land, on request of and to the owner, the money not being a lien on the land, like a mortgage, it is plain that land on which the forty-percent arrangement had not been made would be worth just that much more than land on which the arrangement had been executed. It is the same as though each plot of land had buried in the earth a pot of money or a vein of metal. The land with the gold taken out would be worth less than that with it not taken out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the forty percent is a lien on the land, it leaves the owner only a sixty-percent equity, depreciating the selling price by that much. If the land is already mortgaged, what equity would a further forty-percent lien leave the owner 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been a quite general experience that currency devoid of wealth or substantial value behind it, possesses certain inherent weaknesses, attributable partly to human nature, which have made it advisable rigidly to restrict the volume of such currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When there are two kinds of money, one with real value and the other without it, the people naturally prefer the money with real value. : This is not so apparent when the volume of the non-value currency is kept to a very low figure, as when the restrictions are loosed and the volume increases. When this takes place, the people begin to hoard the valuable currency, more and more rapidly, and the non-value currency depreciates in purchasing power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It may be said that the volume will be permanently restricted to forty percent; but the r experience of other countries is that when the valuable money begins to disappear, the government becomes hard up for funds and begins to issue non-value money to pay its bills. The necessities of the politicians—not statesmen— running affairs compel them, in the face of <sub>s </sub>political ruin, to postpone some of their troubles by the simple expedient of starting the printing presses on more money. This is the cause, in part, of the monetary troubles of Germany, Austria, and other countries, and is what comes from the issuance of any considerable volume of such currency. Any country that desires to court such troubles has only to increase the quantity of non-value or “fiat” money to the point where it begins to displace valuable § money. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font10"> believe it is plain to even the very uneducated, that when there are two kinds of ? money, valuable and non-valuable, anyone will prefer to possess the valuable money, and the j. more so as the non-valuable money shrinks in purchasing power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ j</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It might be asked: How can it be certain that non-valuable money issued to the proportion of ’ just forty percent of land valuation will always, j in good times and bad, be in just the proper limited quantity to be kept from depreciating &quot;&nbsp;in purchasing value! If it exceeds at any time by even a trifle the limit where its purchasing power shows shrinkage, hoarding of the vain-able currency begins—and the trouble is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also, where will the high-minded brand of ■ &amp;&nbsp;politician be found who will perpetually exer-cise the self-control to keep the volume of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fiat .*4 </span><span class="font10">money down below the non-shrinking point? Governments are run, as a regular thing, by politicians. In moments of crises statesmen arise, for a time, but the business of governing inevitably draws in the politician type for the year-in-year-out government work. To the politician’s mind it is difficult to levy taxes enough to keep voters satisfied with the office-holder, and so easy to print more money, even if it </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font10"> be worth a little less. To open the door to fiat money in large volume is to start on the toboggan slide that has so swiftly swept </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Cen</span><span class="font10">tral Europe to its ever lowering level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is doubtless a condition where </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the vol-</span><span class="font10">ume of money or credit—the same thing.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">insufficient; but the main trouble requiring ■ remedy is the unequal and inequitable distribution of it. The Golden Rule is the only solution. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We may not like all that is done by </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the -</span><span class="font10">bankers, but the common people can be thankful that applied selfishness in their instance </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gives </span><span class="font10">and maintains a money with real value behind </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE nations with the highest birth-rate began the World War: Germany with 31.7 per</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1,000 of her population; Austria with 33.7; Russia with 50; and Serbia with 38.6. Later Italy with her 38.7 came in, as the world is informed today, upon the promise of territory held by Austria. Among the persistently neutral countries, we have Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, all with lower birth-rates, the average being slightly over 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germany, the leader in the struggle, increased her population from 41,000,000 in 1871 to 67,-000,000 in 1918, while her food supply increased B </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font10">small percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1913 the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Berliner Post</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> had this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Can a great and rapidly growing nation like Germany always renounce all claims to further development </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font9"> to the expansion of its political power? The final settlement with France and England, the expansion of out colonial possessions in order to create new German homes for the overflow of our population— these are problems which must be faced in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">H. G. Wells in a recent article tells us that the next war will be brought about by the prob</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">lem </span><span class="font10">of population. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Japan is teeming and she must expand; and unless modern social and political organization supplies a new and more humane process of adjustment before it is too late Japan will go to war. It is assumed that Japan will go to war within the next generation in order to provide breathing apace for her overcrowded population.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a well-known fact among social workers that sub-normal parents are more prolific than normal ones. Miss Brooking, superintendent of the Alexandra Industrial School, Toronto, in speaking of the delinquent girl who she says is generally unbalanced, sometimes feebleminded and almost always undernourished, makes this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The importance of the problem is seen in a moment’s consideration of the special influence wielded by the ‘mother sex.’ It may be said that the effect on the race will be negligible, that this type is of small importance, that the very- effects of sin lessen the danger of reproducing their kind, that the delinquent girl if unreclaimed frequently dies early. So she does. But I have known her to become the mother of nineteen children-first, and then die comparatively early. I have seen four children before the mother was twenty. Many of these poor, unfortunate children may, probably will, die early, but enough will live to contaminate the race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sixty percent of all prostitutes are feebleminded; seventy-five percent of the cases </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">venereal diseases are traceable to prostitutes. The New York Department of Health in 1914 stated that twenty-five percent of New York’s population of 6,000,000 have venereal disease of some kind. Do you know what </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">happens to </span><span class="font10">babies born of parents affected with this disease ? They arc born blind or diseased. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">If they </span><span class="font10">live at all, very few are normal. I could </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">quote </span><span class="font10">innumerable statistics, but shall give only </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">observation of Kaufman, this taken from the pamphlet, “Prevalence of Venereal Diseases </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">Canada”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Among nine syphilitic couples there were sixty-six pregnancies; these included thirty-three abortions or still-births and thirty-three living children. Of the thirty-three living, twenty died, four during the first year of life, three suicided, two were epileptics and died at the age of forty. Thirteen are still living of whom only two are normal. In the face of these facts should, people suffering from these diseases continue </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">raising</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230704_files/g_E_19230704-16.png" alt="" style="width:21pt;height:645pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">children to further contaminate the race? Should, they </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9">denied contraceptive information? Should tubercular parents be refused the information, especially when sixty-five percent of the women afflicted with tuberculosis die as a result of pregnancy? Or perhaps their children live; are they healthy or tubercular? More often the latter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These statistics do not tell of the overworked fathers, of the unceasing and increasing pain of overburdened mothers, of the agony of children fighting their way against the handicaps of ill-health, insufficient food, lack of education, and toil that breaks the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But even if there is no disease in the family, can any woman stand the annual baby? Physicians say that there should be two or three years between the children; that this is absolutely necessary for a mother to regain her strength and replenish her system. We hear much of woman’s place being in the home. Granted that it is, but that does not necessarily mean that any woman shall have so large </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">family as to make a drudge of her for the rest of her life. Neither does it mean that children should come when there is no money with which to provide for them. The first right of the child is to be wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perhaps those who object most strongly to birth-control are the people who argue that it is against religion. Many Bible students tell us that there is nothing in the Bible which condemns the use of preventives. The simplest way is for all who believe it wrong to refrain from using those means, but not to try to force their morals on people who are guided by different standards of morality. “Religion is a matter of faith, not reason.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Holland, where for forty years they have had birth control, they have less illegitimacy, less abortion and less prostitution. The same is true of New Zealand. Holland has a higher percentage of physically fit men in its army than any other European country; and the average stature of the Dutch has increased over four inches in fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When we consider natural resources, Holland is the poorest country in the. world. The very land exists only through the perseverance of the inhabitants who keep it and themselves from sinking into the sea by an intricate network of dikes. But in spite of this it is the most prosperous of small countries. In Holland practically every child born is wanted, planned</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">for ahead of its coming, and tenderly cared for afterwards. The stork brings no surprises. ' Fewer children are born, but a greater number of them live. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>r</sup> \</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sanity of Holland’s birth policies is . emphasized if you visit Holland. In Holland the children might wear patched clothes and wooden shoes, but their little legs are sturdy and their cheeks rounded. To show that this was not always true of Holland, we need only <sup>1 </sup>quote Dr. Rutgen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I remember in my youth the houses of our poor ■ were deplorably overcrowded and the slums of our cities were a disgrace. Most of the families are now held down . to one, two, or three children; and to see how decently -people in the most modest circumstances now rear and J educate their young is to realize at once the wonderful </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">-i </span><span class="font9">results of the movement.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Methods of regulating the birth-rate are known and practised in New Zealand today by the entire community. The information has been available for more than a genera- <sub>; </sub>tion. Preventives are on sale by chemists and specialists; and doctors, nurses and private individuals are free to give the information. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The birth-rate of New Zealand, 263 per 1,000, &nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">low compared with other countries, but its death-rate, nine per 1,000, is so much lower than theirs that it has the highest natural increase; 17.3 per thousand. Australia comes next with an increase of 11.76. These figures &gt;&nbsp;are in happy contrast with those of the United States, where in 1916 there is a birth-rate </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">24.8, but an infant death-rate of 14.7, an in- ’ crease of 10.1. In a period of thirty years the . T Dutch baby death-rate dropped from 180 to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">90 &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a thousand, which is the record rate for Europe, -a New Zealand has the lowest general death-rate <sup>4 </sup>and the lowest baby death-rate in the world. Does birth regulation, then, tend to wipe out <sub>: </sub>the race? No one need fear that people will cease to want babies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ -</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">E</span><span class="font10">VEN while there lingers yet the memory of snow-clad hills and barren trees, of icebound brooks and frozen ponds, we gaze in astonishment to see the miracle of Spring wrought under our very eyes.—Psalm 104: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What magic power has brought forth those tender sprouts of green where but a month ago was seen only the bare, brown twig, giving us no sign of such promise? How could this mellow, fertile soil, which the plowman so eagerly turns, ever have been the solid frozen mass which gave the echo to our tread? And it is not only that the Frost King has been completely dethroned, but that the wand of some great magician, as it w’ere [the power of God in the sunshine], smote the earth, in response </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">multitude of tiny, verdant blades have sprung from the ground, making our very footsteps rebound with their living instinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Down in the meadow, where the brook is flowing with a murmur of subdued gladness, as if it feared the return of thongs and fetters, there gleams a strip of brighter green along its course, painted by the same skillful Hand </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">has laid such beautiful tints of mingled </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">azure </span><span class="font10">and gleaming white upon the celestial vaults, which were gloomy and foreboding with Winter's leaden gray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every morning, at the break of day, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font10">comes from the top of the cherry-tree </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">such a </span><span class="font10">message of hope and joy that it makes our pulses throb responsive to the song, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">whose </span><span class="font10">trustful, light-hearted beauty is but vaguely understood by sinful, burdened humanity. It </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font10">song of praise and wonder too, no doubt, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">the Hidden Power that has brought back </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">warm rays of sunlight and the soft, gentle breezes that are so loved by robin and bluebird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">0 thou wonderful, powerful Hidden Impulse, where art thou not evident! We hear thee </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font10">early dawn and at dusk of night. At noon thy forms are growing and gleaming about our path. We feel thine instinct within us, that lends fresh vigor to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font10">sluggish veins, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">wakens new thoughts and passions in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font10">breast.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Copy of a Letter of Withdrawal from a Masonic Lodge</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norfolk Lodge No. 1, A. F. &amp;&nbsp;A. M., Norfolk, Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Worshipful Master, Wardens and Brethren:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. 1 am enclosing herewith my check for $7.00, with request for demit, or withdrawal from Norfolk Lodge No. 1, and the Masonic Fraternity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. I give below my reasons for this action, which I trust will be carefully considered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. When I became a Christian and compared the tenets of the Masonic Fraternity with the Bible, which Masonry teaches should be the “Huie and Guide of our Faith,” I note that they are at variance one with the other, that they are as far apart as the east is from the west.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. I wish here to emphasize, however, that I have no quarrel with the Masonic Fraternity, or any member. I have nothing but brotherly love for you all. In fact, of all the Fraternal Organizations in the world, I consider the Masonic Fraternity without a peer. But as a Christian, I cannot hold to doctrines which place the Word of God at naught; doctrines based upon the first lie, which was told in Eden, and which lie also has been, and is at present, perpetuated in the religious systems both Catholic and Protestant, as well as the so-called heathen religions of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">5. As I desire to be correctly and thoroughly understood, I shall go somewhat into detail:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span><span class="font10"> Upon entering the Lodge Room, even the Entered Apprentice approaching the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Altar </span><span class="font10">beholds the Holy Bible thereon, upon which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">displayed the Square and Compasses. He is told that the “Holy Bible is to be the Rule and Guide of his Faitli; his actions to be squared by virtue, and his passions circumscribed.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">7. To this admonition every man and every Christian can heartily agree and subscribe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">8. In another degree, we are pointed to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">sprig of Acacia and told that it is an emblem of Immortality, and symbolizes “the better </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font10">of man [referring to the soul] which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">survives </span><span class="font10">[lives after] the grave/and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">can never, never, </span><span class="font10">never die.” Notwithstanding the fact that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ths </span><span class="font10">Holy Bible upon the Altar, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which is to be ths </span><span class="font10">•'Rule and Guide of our Faith” declares (Genesis 2:7) that man </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">is a</span><span class="font10"> soul (a living, breathing creature), and Ezekiel 18:4 that “the soul that sinneth, it [the soul] shall die.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MO</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">9. The Wise Man Solomon (to whom Masonic Lodges were originally dedicated) says (Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20) that both men and beasts die alike; that both have one breath; that both arc of the dust and return to dust at death; so that man has no preeminence above a beast. Man, as well as the beast, would remain in the death state, had it not been for the ransom sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In Eccl. 12:7, speaking of dissolution the Wise Man says: “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” The word spirit is not synonymous with soul (Hebrew for soul being </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">nephesh, </span><span class="font10">and for spirit </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ruach,</span><span class="font10"> which means primarily, wind, air). Solomon is here saying that the body (composed of the seventeen elements of the earth) shall return to the earth as it was, and that the wind, breath of life, shall return to the great storehouse of God—the atmosphere. God gives us the air we breathe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">10. The “Rule of our Faith” further states in Luke 12:4,5, Jesus speaking, that we should not fear him who is able to kill the body but who cannot kill the soul, but rather fear Him (Jehovah) who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell fire </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Gehenna</span><span class="font10"> fire—symbolizing utter destruction). In Psalm 16:10 and Acts 2: 27, speaking of Jesus, it says: &quot;Thou [Jehovah] wilt not leave my soul in hell&quot;—the tomb, the death-state, oblivion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">11. As you see from the above, the teachings of Masonry are absolutely and diametrically in opposition to the Holy Bible, the “Rule and Guide of our Faith.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">12. You can see that if the soul is immortal (immortality meaning a condition of life in which death is an impossibility) and cannot die, manifestly there could be no resurrection from the dead; for none would be dead, Tbis doctrine, you see, denies the resurrection, which is so clearly taught throughout the Bible, and which is the only hope of a dead world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">13. Then you say: “That our bodies will arise and become as incorruptible as our souls.” Now let us go to the Holy Bible, the “Rule and Guide of our Faith.” The apostle Paul, in his great treatise on the resurrection in the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians, proves that : there are to be two kinds of resurrection; one (the first resurrection) a change of nature from human to life on the spirit plane, and the other resurrection to an earthly (human) nature. He also said that there are bodies celestial (heav- -enly, spiritual) and bodies terrestrial (earthly).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">“So also is the resurrection of the dead.” But . concerning the earthly body he says plainly that it will not be this body that goes into the ground which will be raised, but that “God giv-eth it [the being, the personality, the soul] </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a . </span><span class="font10">body as it pleaseth him.” Then he goes on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">show that a grain of wheat, which is planted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and dies, but which is quickened with new life, brings forth wheat—not oats or some other . .. grain, but the kind of grain planted. In other words, if in death we plant a human seed, in . the resurrection a human body (not the one sowed, however) will be reaped; and if we have been begotten by the holy spirit of God to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">new nature (spirit nature) through belief in <sub>k </sub>the merits of the ransom sacrifice of Christ &lt;&nbsp;Jesus, then a spiritual seed has been sowed, which, in the resurrection, will bring forth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">celestial (heavenly, spiritual) body.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">14. These fundamental doctrines are mis- • taught not only by Masonry, but by the clergy -and religious systems of our day, which are not according to the Word of God; and as a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus, I rhust and <sub>; </sub>do desire to maintain my faith in the Word of * God, even though it makes “every man a liar,” * as the Scriptures declare, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">15. I trust that you will appreciate my posi-' <sub>f </sub>tion, and realize that in order to be true to myself and my God, I must choose between . truth and error; and I choose rather to be guided by the Holy Bible, letting it, in fact and reality, be the “Rule and Guide of my Faith.” .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">16. I wish to thank you very much for past &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub>;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">courtesies, and trust that those who are seek- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ing truth and righteousness may be guided into the truth; and that they may “seek righteous- ' ness, seek meekness. It may be that [they] shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger” (Zephaniah 2:3); and that they may be among the “millions now living who will never die,” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">3 is so clearly stated in the Holy Bible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-g</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">CCORDING to our understanding of the teachings of the Scriptures we are now living in the harvest time of the Gospel age, in the great consummation mentioned in our text. The statement is not an absurd scarecrow to alarm the ignorant and the wicked, for we are fully persuaded of the truthfulness of the Scriptural declaration: &quot;None of the wicked shall understand.” (Daniel 12:10) The announcement that we are now living in the end or harvest time of the Gospel age is, however, a message full of importance to the Lord’s people, to all who profess to be members of spiritual Zion. To these it means that a crucial test is upon the church which will fully separate the merely nominal Christians, the tare class, from the genuine Christians, the wheat class of our Lord’s parable.—Matthew 13: 24-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our Lord’s first advent was in the harvest time of the Jewish age, more than 1,800 years ago. Then His message and that of His apostles served as a sickle of truth and as threshing instruments to separate in that professedly holy nation the “Israelites indeed” from others. In that harvest time our Lord represented Himself as the chief reaper, and the winnowing of the threshed wheat to separate it from the chaff of that nation was a part of the ministry of the truth at that time. The result was the gathering of the Jewish wheat to a higher plane, from the house of servants into the house of sons. (John </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1:12,13) </span><span class="font10">Subsequently the chaff of that nation </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">burned; that is, fiery trouble came upon </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">them, </span><span class="font10">which the Apostle declares was &quot;wrath to the uttermost.” (1 Thessalonians 2:16) The fire of trouble destroyed the national existence </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the Jews, though it did not destroy them as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The last of the prophets, John the Baptist, referring to Christ’s work as a reaper of that age said: “Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather his wheat into the garner [gospel favor], but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire” [the time of trouble which consumed the Jews nationally]. (Matthew 3:12) He referred to the same thing when he said at another time respecting the work and results of our Lord’s ministry: “He shall baptize you with the holy spirit, and with fire.” (Matthew 3:11) The holy spirit baptism came upon the “Israelites indeed”; the baptism of fire, of trouble, came upon the others, “wrath to the uttermost.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font10">that trouble the apostle Paul speaks saying, “What if God, willing to show his wrath, ... endured . . . the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction.” (Romans 9:22) Our Lord speaks of the same, saying of the coming trouble, “These be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled . . . for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.”—Luke 21:22,23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE Jewish age was a prototype of the Gospel age. Hence the harvest of the Jewish age gives us clear conceptions of what may </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">expected in the harvest time of the Gospel age. Here as there we must expect the gathering of the wheat into the garner; we must expect the burning of the tares, as in the end of the Jewish age there was a burning of the chaff, for thus the Lord’s parable relating to the present age explains the matter. But we are tqday on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">higher plane, on the plane of the spirit instead of on the plane of the flesh, on the plane of sons instead of on the plane of servants, on the plane of spiritual Israelites instead of on the plane of natural Israelites; hence we must expect the gathering into the barn due at the end of this age to signify the gathering of the elect </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">church </span><span class="font10">to the Lord at his second advent in power </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">great glory, the consummation of the long-promised first resurrection to glory, honor </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">immortality, the divine nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the wheat and the tares represent only those who profess to be God's people, God’s church, this parable does not relate to the world in general, and consequently the burning of the tares pictures rather the troubles and fiery trials coming upon professed but not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">real </span><span class="font10">Christians rather than troubles coming upon the heathen world. For instance, it is not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">field (the “world”) that is to be burned, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">tares.

(Revelation 11:17) Rather, it gives ■ us the suggestion, elsewhere set forth, that God’s plan in dealing with Satan and present evil institutions is not so much to overpower them and crush them as to permit their selfishness and immorality to wreck themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On every hand we see these disintegrating forces at work.

<p><span class="font10">rpHE prophet Daniel describes this time and marks its date at the standing up of the great Prince. He declares that it shall be &quot;a time of trouble such as was not since there </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">a nation.” The trouble with which the Jewish age closed was an awful trouble, a foreshadowing of the coming trouble, but not so great, neither so widely extended. The trouble of the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">an awful one, but not so great as this time of trouble that is coming, respecting which one of the prophets declares there shall be no peace to him that goeth out nor to </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10"> that cometh in; to him that buyeth nor to him that selleth; because every man’s hand is against his neighbor. (Zechariah 8:10) The strife of nations and of parties, of unions and of combinations, will extend to the individuals of the world and produce an individual conflict and strife. Our Lord Jesus the great Prophet quoted approvingly Daniel’s prophecy about this great time of trouble such as was not since there was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">nation, and our Lord adds the consoling words: “Nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24:31) We are glad that this time of trouble will practically end the trouble of this world; that there never will be such again; that on the ashes of present institutions the Lord Himself will rear a kingdom of righteousness which shall establish justice throughout the world on a basis not ofl selfishness but of love and justice.</span></p>

Speaking of those ,who should be interested in the second coming of the Lord and the consummation of this age, he declares that, instead of following the Scriptures and the Scriptural hopes, they will be following the ungodly, higher critical desires of their own worldly minds, and he represents them as saying, &quot;Where is the promise of his presence?” and declares that from their standpoint all things continue as they were from the beginning of the world—that they see no reason for expecting a harvest and a change, of dispensation. (2 Peter 3:4) It is not our province to give ears or eyes to any; we merely call to the attention of those who have the hearing ear and the understanding heart the things which the Word of God clearly sets forth as being now due of accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Who can intelligently study the Scriptural record of God’s dealing's with the nation of Israel and not perceive the deep plowing of that people in their Egyptian bondage, the i harrowing of that people in their wilderness . experiences, the sowing among them of the law, ■ the weeding and culture given them as a people throughout their age, and the harvesting that came in the end of that age? And what “Israel- &nbsp;&nbsp;=</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ite indeed” does not know something of the &nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">plowshare of sorrow and of trouble in his own ; heart experiences which first prepared </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10"> to become a true disciple of the Lord? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font10">UR text implies that many who hear the present message will be inclined to disregard it, and the Prophet warns such, saying, “Be ye not mockers”; do not scoff at this matter, lest your bands be made strong; lest the blindness and ignorance and misunderstanding of the divine plan, so general in the world today, shall bind you hand and foot and hinder you from entering into the joys of the Lord, from the understanding of His plan, and hinder you also from making the preparation of heart necessary to secure to you a place in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the context the Prophet points out the lessons of husbandry; that there is one preparation of the soil for one kind of grain, another preparation for another kind of grain, and that there is one way of reaping and threshing one kind of grain and another way of handling another kind; and furthermore he points out that the husbandman does not spend all of his time in one part of the great work, but step by step the matter proceeds to the completion, the gathering of the crop. Thus the Lord gives a lesson to His people. We are to expect in the operations of grace, plowing, harrowing, seedsowing, watering and weeding, ripening and harvesting. And we are to expect different crops, as, for instance, there was one crop dealt with during the Jewish age and a harvest in the end of that age, and another crop has been</span></p>

Which of the true Israelites does not long for the harvesting time, when all the true wheat shall be gathered to the plane of spiritual perfection and glory, when they shall be forever with the Lord and co-laborers with Him in the glory time that shall follow ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The great time of trouble with which this present evil dispensation closes is the plowshare of trouble which God will use in breaking up the fallow ground of the whole world to prepare it for the great planting of the restitution times, when the whole world of mankind shall have the care of the great Superintendent, who, we are assured, will yet see of the fruits of the travail of His soul and be abundantly satisfied. This thought that the coming trouble will bring righteousness to the world is abundantly borne out by the statement of the Scripture that &quot;when</span></p>

We are to expect, then, that the gospel of the kingdom will be announced, and ; that all “Israelites indeed&quot; will be glad to hear the joyful news. We are to expect that it will ■ be an attraction to such, that it will attract ; them away from the errors and falsehoods ~ which to a greater or lesser degree have been blinding all, not only during the dark ages, but . since. We expect that it ■will attract all of this class from every denomination not to a new denomination, but to a closer heart-fcllow-. ship with the Lord Himself, that their union should not be a sectarian one, but a heart-union with the Lord and -with all of like precious faith in Him and in His Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHE </span><span class="font10">Scriptures represent that in the end of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font10">the age the tares will be so abundant as to practically overwhelm the wheat and obscure it; and this whole class, wheat and tares, throughout the whole spiritual world called Christendom, and divided into hundreds of sects and parties, teaching more or less of ' divine truth and more or less of human tradition, is now to be dealt with. The Lord applies to the whole mass the name Babylon. The n</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">am</span><span class="font10">e has a double signification: primarily it means the gate of God, the gateway by which the world of mankind might pass from the world and sin to God and righteousness, and eventually have a share in the Lord’s resurrection; but through the operation of Satan and inherent selfishness much of the good of Babylon became beclouded and much of it became replaced with error, so that today the name Babylon as applied to Christian people means not a gateway to God but confusion, mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Looking back to the Jewish age and its harvest we can know the particular moment when the Lord said to nominal Israel: “Your house is left unto you desolate&quot;; and so we can trace to the year 1878 the parallel of this—the Lord’s rejection of Babylon and the declaration that Christendom as a whole is rejected from any, longer being recognized as His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you ask, then, what the Lord would expect His true people to do today? We answer that for our day there is a particular message of the Lord, and that in the same breath that it declares that Babylon is fallen, is fallen, from divine favor, rejected as fleshly Israel was rejected and for similar reasons, there comes additionally the message: “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, . and that ye receive not of her plagues.”—Eeve-lation 18:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ET it be distinctly noticed that these words recognize that the Lord’s people have been in Babylon, and that they were not considered blameworthy for being there until the appointed time, until her rejection, until their eye§ being opened they perceived wherein she had erred and misled them away from the Lord and the beauty of His Word and plan into doctrines of devils, which wholly misrepresent the divine character and plan. These words apply not to those who see nothing of what we see, who have no ears to hear the present message. They </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ap</span><span class="font10">ply not to those who consider the doctrines of the nominal churches thoroughly satisfactory and Scriptural. They apply merely to those who have the hearing ear and the discerning heart to know the difference between the voice of the true Shepherd and the voice of strangers, to know the difference between the true gospel of God’s dear Son, redemption through His blood, from the gospel of higher criticism and evolution; they are for those who can discern to some extent at least between the doctrines </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">devils, which misrepresent the divine plan, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">the doctrine of redemption, ransom and restitution, which the Word of God sets forth. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">that hath an ear let him hear.

<p><span class="font10">As the Lord left a period of time in the end of the Jewish age between the utter rejection of that people and the culmination of the time of trouble and wrath upon them, so here He has left a space of time in which His people are to come out of her before she shall be utterly swallowed up as a great millstone cast into the sea. Those who are truly the Lord’s people, yet refuse to abandon the false systems and their false teachings, make themselves proper subjects for a share in the plagues that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">coming upon Babylon, because knowing her errors and blasphemies against the divine character they become participants in those blasphemies to a larger extent even than do many of the tares who constitute Babylon, and who might be said to know no better because </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font10">do not truly know the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font10">MITH rushed into the office one day, and in an excited whisper said: “Wynn is showing a parson over the place.” “A parson?” said Tyler. “Yes, a real, live ecclesiastic.” And, sure enough, Wynn entered shortly afterward accompanied by a short, stout, red-faced clergyman. Wynn introduced </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10"> to each member of the office in turn, and he shook hands with them very cordially. He came to Palmer last of all; and while they were greeting one another, Wynn said: “Mr. Palmer belongs to the Bible Students.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘'Bible Students!” ejaculated the minister. &quot;You do not mean Russellism, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Yes; Pastor Bussell’s organization,” replied Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I am opposed to them,” the visitor replied quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“What is it that you do not agree with?” asked Palmer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“All of it,” he retorted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Have you read any of the late Pastor Russell’s works?” Palmer inquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I know all about you; I know all about you!” he exclaimed excitedly. He then went off at such a rate that Palmer could get a word in only occasionally. He said more in three minutes than most people would in ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Pastor Russell was a bad man; he had no training; no authority. What right had he to preach? I had a collegiate education, have preached in twenty-five different churches. Why, I know more Greek than he ever knew. What right had he to make out everyone else was wrong? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hades</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gelienna—</span><span class="font10">what do they mean? Why everyone knows that they refer to the place of departed spirits. The dead unconscious? Ridiculous! ‘Absent from the body, present with the Lord,' ‘Happy are the dead who die in the Lord.’ How can they be happy if they are unconscious ? Why, you are opposed to the Roman church, the Anglican church. You are opposed to all the churches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“We are not opposed to the true church,” quietly put in Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Why, if I believed what you do I would be an atheist!” continued the parson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“If you believed what Pastor Russell taught, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font10">would be a Christian,” replied Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“What! What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I mean that either you have never looked into the teachings of the Pastor, or if you have, you are now wilfully misrepresenting them; and in either case your course is unchristian; whereas I challenge you to prove that anyone of his teachings lead away from faith in the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ignoring this the parson vehemently continued: “The soul immortal? Of course it is immortal. If the Bible did not teach it, the Bible would be a lie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Give me a scripture,” said Palmer. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“A scripture—” and the minister paused. This gave Palmer an opportunity to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“You cannot give me one text in support </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the immortality of the soul, but I can give you a hundred to refute it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“A hundred?” queried the minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘Wes, a hundred; and I will give you one to get on with: 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Il</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark71"></a>p?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">“Everyone knows what that means,” retorted . the minister; “it means separation from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' When Adam sinned he did not die, he was sep-ft arated from God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">g “How would you explain this then; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophet says of Jesus that ‘He poured out His</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul unto death'; and Jesus said that we are to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘fear </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font10"> who is able to destroy both soul and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">body in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna.’</span><span class="font10"> How can the soul be immortal if it can be destroyed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">t “I know all about you, I have it all here,” the “ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parson said, pointing to a small pamphlet in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">4 his hand. “You deny the divinity of Christ.” “We do not,” replied Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">„ “You teach that Christ was a created being. 1 I know all about you. Read the Athanasian t. creed.” With this he hurried out of the office, ; closely followed by Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Well, well,” said Tyler, who had evidently s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enjoyed the. spectacle. &quot;What a hot-headed</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypocrite! He proved nothing, but merely</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">f made unfounded charges. What did he mean “ when he said </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘hades</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna’ ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,” said Palmer, with a smile; “these are</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">two Greek words which in the New Testament ? are translated ‘hell,’ and our learned ecclesias-<sub>;</sub> tical friend evidently does not agree with Pas-? tor Russell’s explanation of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do they mean, then?” the other asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“They have been taken to mean that the t infinitely wise God has provided a place where ‘ human beings are to be tormented to all eter-mty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t believe that,” interposed Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Neither do I; but they must have a meaning,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I think the Pastor has made it clear. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Old Testament there is but one word trans-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">f lated hell. The word is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font10"> and occurs sixty-1 five times in the original. Thirty-one times it is translated grave, thirty-one times hell, and &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three times pit. In not one of these does it</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest torment. It is described as a place of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">darkness, of silence, where there is no trouble, and all are at rest. Solomon says: ‘There is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">kf</span><span class="font10"> no work, device, knowledge nor wisdom in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sheol </span><span class="font10">whither thou goest.’ It has the thought of un-consciousness—oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">r* </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Hades</span><span class="font10"> of the New Testament is the Greek <sub>s</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent to the Hebrew word, as is clearly</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shown by the apostle Peter’s statement in Acts</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">r. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2; 27,</span><span class="font10"> which is a quotation from Psalm 16:10. The only other word </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we have to consider is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna.</span><span class="font10"> This is the name of a valley ~n the southwest side of Jerusalem called in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He</span><span class="font10">brew the Valley of Hinnom. At first it was very beautiful, but on account of idolatry being prae-tised there by the Israelites it was turned into a destructor, and the refuse of the city together with offal and carcasses of animals were burned there. Sometimes the dead bodies of criminals were cast into its fires signifying that they were not worthy of a resurrection. Brimstone was used to aid in the work of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;No one thinks that the wicked are going to be east into this literal valley whose fires have since gone out. It must, therefore, be understood in a figurative sense. What is the figure intended to teach? Torment! No one was ever tormented in the flames of the literal </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna, </span><span class="font10">so we are precluded from such a conclusion. The chief characteristic of fire is its destructiveness, and with this interpretation the plain statements of the Bible agree. It says that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font10">the wicked will God destroy; and again it says that the wicked shall go into everlasting de- . struction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Why are two words in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font10">Testament used for hell?” inquired Tyler, who manifested deep interest in the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Because they refer to different things. Hades applies to the death state of unconsciousness </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">all who have gone into the grave because of Adam’s transgression. But this state of unconsciousness is not to be everlasting; it is termed sleep in the Bible because Jesus has. died and has arranged for their awakening. Jesus said that 'all that are in the graves shall hear </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">voice of the Son of man and shall come forth.’ Notice they are not in a heaven of bliss nor </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">a hell of torment, but in the grave. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and spoke of his condition as sleep. All are to be awakened to have an opportunity of obtaining life through obedience and faith, but any refusing to render obedience after a fair trial will be cast into the Take of fire’ which is explained in the Bible to mean the ‘second death’; that is, destruction from which there will bo no resurrection. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hades - . </span><span class="font10">refers to the first or Adamic death, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna </span><span class="font10">to the second or everlasting death.”—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Revela</span><span class="font10">tion 20:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Thanks,” said Tyler. “I wish the peppery parson had waited to hear your explanation.” ? -</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">rOHE Golden Age is not used as an advertising medium. Occasionally we have taken an advertisement of something because we thought it would afford some of our readers a profitable business. Some criticisms have been lodged against The Golden Age because of a notice that appeared in our columns about Firezone Oil. For this reason we publish the following communication from the Firezone Lubrication Company, College Point, N. Y.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From G. S. Miller, the Manager</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">INCE the first of February we have received, and filled orders to the extent of 5,200 gallons, ranging from one quart to 3,000 gallons. The 3,000-gallon order was shipped to supply the Pacific coast trade on March 25th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. G. C. Van Amburgh, 3709 Simpson Ave., Aberdeen, Wash., says that his business has increased wonderfully as a result of demonstrating the heat-resisting properties of the oil, running a Ford without water, radiator or fan. He says: “In my first demonstration I ran my car six days without a drop of water, and four days without a radiator. Have signs all over it, and stop in front of every dealer’s place, and call them out to look at it. They are simply speechless. Mechanics come out and say: ‘Well, that’s some demonstration 1’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I ran her first twenty-five miles over gravelly and hilly roads at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour, the best mechanic in Hoquiam driving; and on our return</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">we climbed the steepest hill (and it’s some hill) </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">Hoquiam, and then idled this 1917 Ford on the level pavement, down to four miles an hour.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Van Amburgh is selling to the gasoline filling stations in barrels and five-gallon cans to treat their stock gasoline for the trade. One of them, the Roblin’s Service Station, writes us: “I have been using the Fibezone Oil since April 1st, and my business has just about doubled in that time in both gas and oil. Accessories and tires are also going better. I’m sure pleased with the way Fibezone is taking here, and am glad I started with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. G. H. Wall, 30 N. American St., Stockton, Calif., says that he has a good testimonial from the stage lines and one from the city of Stockton, as well as several from prominent men who are using the oil. He has several gas stations using the oil in their trade with splendid satisfaction and many splendid prospects through the northern part of California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are shipping H. L.&lt; Brian, 422 Market St., Shreveport, La., 500 gallons, his first order for the state of Louisiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus far we have not received even one complaint about this oil. On the contrary, we could give many testimonials as to its valuable qualities. It is remarkable that in so short a time we have been able to get </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">large amount into general use. The low price at which we can market this oil, places it within the reach of all, and makes it a great benefit to the automobile industries of the world.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>The Negro Exodus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE wave of prosperity in the North has brought 100,000 Negroes from the South during the past six months. The exodus has been principally from South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. The South is already short, of farm labor, large areas of cotton standing unpicked throughout the harvesting season because of labor shortage. What happens in these </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mig</span><span class="font10">rations is that the Negro workers in Southern mills and factories go north, while farm labor moves into town to take up industrial work. For the first time in history white women in the South are now sometimes seen working in the fields along with the men, rather than lose their crops; and many a Southern woman is now doing her own housework because the colored girls and women have gone north with their husbands and brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The problems of the Negro in the North center largely in the housing situation, which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">hard for the whites to solve and harder for the Negroes. The whole world is in a housing shortage. In England there are three million people who have no homes and who are living in with other families. There is overcrowding to suffocation in New York and other large American cities. Immense areas of New York city and of Chicago are solidly Negro, so that one may walk for blocks and seldom see a white person. The new arrivals from the South must necessarily locate in these sections, which expand their borders but slowly. Chicago’s Negro population is estimated to have grown from 100,000 at the time of the race riots in 1919 to 110,000 at this time.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>STUDIES IN THE “IIARP OF GOD’</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">K</span><span class="font8">Wifli issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|TO</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gwg</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>198</sup>It is very important, then, that we understand the meaning of ransom; hence we here define it. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ransom</span><span class="font10"> means something to loosen with; that is, a redemptive price. It is the means or price or value which can be used in loosening or releasing something that is in bondage or in restraint or imprisoned. Necessarily the ransom-price must be exactly equivalent to, or corresponding with, that which justice requires of the thing or being that is in bondage or imprisonment. Hence we say that ransom means an exact corresponding price. A perfect man sinned and was sentenced to death; hence an exact corresponding price would be the death of another perfect man and the value of that life presented in place of the one who first sinned and was held in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>109</sup>Sin-offwring</span><span class="font10"> means the presentation and use of the ransom-price. On the atonement day performed by the Jews in type, the blood of the bullock represented the poured-out life; and therefore it stood for the ransom-price or value of the life. The carrying of the blood into the Most Holy and sprinkling it there pictured the sin-offering, that is, a presentation in the Most Holy (which represented heaven itself) of the value or merit of the perfect life. We will see, therefore, as we examine this question that the ransom-price was provided on earth by the death of Jesus; that preparation for the sin-offering was begun on earth, but must be finished in heaven, where the value of the ransomprice is presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;’Other Scriptures show that it w<sup>T</sup>as intended by Jehovah that the great Redeemer should pour out His life in death and that this should constitute the ransom-price, which should be made an offering for sin. God foretold this— which is equivalent to a promise—through His prophet when he wrote concerning the great coming Redeemer the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;&quot;‘Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.”—Isaiah 53.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The World Crisis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bi) Our Western Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHE Los Angeles </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Examiner</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of August 27th says: ‘Thirty thousand people heard Judge Rutherford’s lecture on ‘Armageddon’ yesterday afternoon at the Coliseum.” Many thousands more vainly attempted to reach the Coliseum in time for the lecture but were prevented from so doing because of the inadequate transportation facilities. Without doubt it was the greatest religious gathering ever held on the Pacific Coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This lecture was the grand finale of the annual convention of the International Bible Students Association held at Los Angeles August 18-26 inclusive. At the afternoon session of the convention on Saturday Judge Rutherford, President of the Association, delivered a thrilling address on the parable of the Sheep and Goats, particularly emphasizing the fact that in all the denominational churches the Fundamentalists are making a heroic fight for the Bible as God’s inspired Word and that it is the duty of the Bible Students to encourage them in contending for the faith once delivered to the saints. At the conclusion of his address he read a resolution, which this great assembly of Christians by a rising vote unanimously adopted. We set out herewith the resolution in full, together with a synopsis of the lectures on the “Sheep and Goats’’ and “All Nations Are Marching to Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sheep and Goats</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN the followers of Christ Jesus can plainly see prophecy concerning the kingdom in course of fulfilment they have cause for rejoicing. Prophecy means foretelling events which are to happen in the future, the fulfilment of which marks a definite period in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s plan. Uppermost in the minds of Christians since the days of Pentecost has been the coming kingdom of God, for which Jesus taught His followers to pray. He prophesied the events that would mark that important date. Bible chronology shows that the Gentile Times ended in 1914, which date also marks the time when Messiah took unto Himself His great power to reign, at which time the old world ended. Jesus said that the end of the world would be marked by a world war, famine, pestilence, revolutions in various parts of the earth, the persecution of Christians, and the favor of God returning to Israel. These things began to have f</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ulfilm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ent in the year 1914, and in rapid succession each prophecy has been fulfilled. To the saints Jesus said: 'When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your deliverance draweth nigh? Let all Christians, therefore, rejoice because the proof is conclusive that this important time has come. As a further mark of this important date, Jesus said that there would be a great falling away from the faith by those who compose the membership in the denominational churches, and that particularly this would be true with reference to the fclergy and the ‘principal ones of the flock? Just now we see this prophecy in course of f</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ulfilm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ent. In the denominational churches there is now a great controversy between two contending factions, namely: (1) that faction which names itself Modernists and which denies the f</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of man and denies the blood of Jesus Christ as the redemptive price of man and the coming of the Messianic kingdom; and (2) that class designated as Fundamentalists, which believes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">t the Bible is God’s Woi8 of truth, that man was created perfect, that he fell because of sin, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus 'died to redeem man and will come again. Yet these fail to separate themselves from those who deny the faith, contrary to the admonition of God’s Word.—1 Timothy 6: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Those who wholly trust in the Lord should call the attention of all believers to these facts and warn them to take heed to the Scriptures and to come out from amongst the unrighteous systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Jesus foretold that there would develop in the church denominations two general classes, considered from another viewpoint; one of which He designated under the term of 'sheep’ and the other under the term 'goats.’ Aptly these two animals portray the characteristics of the two classes named. A goat is stubborn, heady, selfish, proud, covetous, disobedient, refusing to be taught or led, fierce and cruel even to the point of forsaking its own; A sheep is meek, gentle, teachable, manifests a desire to do right, to be led in the right way and to learn righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Jesus said that those of the goat class would pretend to be Christians and do great works in His name, but that they would neglect to minister to His brethren, the true saints, and would despise them and cruelly push them aside. Thus Jesus speaks to that class: T was hungry and ye gave me no meat, thirsty and ye gave me no drink, a stranger and ye took me not in, naked and ye clothed me not, sick and in prison and ye visited me not.’ They ask: 'When did we fail to do these things?’ to which Jesus replies: Tnasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not unto me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;To the sheep class He said: 'Ye did these good deeds unto my brethren, therefore I count it as though ye did them unto me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Lord came to His temple in 1918 and there began the judgment of His own people. The Scriptures show that shortly thereafter follows His judgment upon the nations of 'Christendom,’ made up as they are of the clergy, financial and political classes, who are rulers in the world and in the denominational churches, in which are also many of the sheep class. Furthermore, the Lord points out that this judgment would result in the goat class receiving great punishment similar to that to be ministered unto the devil, whereas the sheep class are to be granted full opportunity for life everlasting. To the goats Jesus says: Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’ And unto the sheep class He says: 'Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.’ Thus is shown that the goat class have no further opportunity for existence because of their unworthiness thereof, whereas the sheep class, or teachable ones, are to have full opportunity during the Millennial reign, and all those who</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. will learn righteousness and obey the Lord will receive everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The judgment of the Lord is upon all Christendom, and the saints are to participate therein. (Psalm 149:5-9) The time has come for those who believe in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ as man’s Redeemer, to completely separate themselves from those organizations and systems whose leaders and rulers deny 'the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ,* whose blood is the redemptive price of mankind (Jude 4; 1 Peter 1:18,19; 1 Timothy 2: • 3-6), and to point them to the warning words of Jesus from heaven saying, 'Come out of &quot;&nbsp;her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.’— Revelation 18:4.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Resolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E, T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> International Bible Students in general convention assembled, again de-’ clare our absolute faith in and allegiance to Jehovah God our Father and to His beloved Son Christ Jesus, our Redeemer and King, and our absolute confidence in the Bible as God’s inspired Word of truth given to man for his j guidance and instruction in righteousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">As</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> followers of our Lord who are diligently &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">striving to be His true and faithful witnesses, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we deem it our privilege and duty to call the attention of all peace- and order-loving peoples of all the nations to the deplorable conditions now existing in the world and to point them to- -; Messiah's kingdom as the only remedy for national and individual ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;We hold and declare that Jesus Christ or-ganized His church in purity to represent </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> &lt;&nbsp;• upon earth; that selfish and ambitious men, loving earthly honor and glory more than the approval of God, have brought in false doo-trines destructive of faith in God and His ' J</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Word, and as a result there now exist in the various denominational churches two general classes, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“First: Those who pretend to be Christians but do not believe in the Bible as God’s inspired Word of truth, who repudiate the doctrines of the fall of man and his redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ, which class is made up of apostate clergymen and 'the principal of their flocks/ who are worldly men of strong financial and political influence, which class exercises the controlling influence and power in the denominational organizations; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Second: That great multitude of peoples who claim to be Christians and who hold and believe the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, namely, that the Bible is the Word of God written under inspiration of the holy spirit; that the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to redeem man from sin and death; that He gave His life a ransom for mankind; that He rose from the dead and ascended into heaven and will come again and set up His kingdom, as He promised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The class first above mentioned are lovers of self, covetous, boasters, unthankful, unholy, fierce, despisers of those who strive to be good, heady, highminded, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof, and slander, misrepresent and persecute those who faithfully try to represent our Lord. (2 Timothy 3:1-5; Matthew 24:9; Mark 13: 9) While cla</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g to be representatives of our Lord, they misrepresent Him in this, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(1) They have forsaken the Word of God, denied the fall of man and denied the .Lord Jesus, by whose blood man must be redeemed. —Jude 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(2) They have used the name Christian and the Christian religion as a cloak to hide their unrighteousness and to enable them to deceive the people, and have committed spiritual fornication by uniting church with political and financial power.—Jeremiah 2:21-24; Revelation 18:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(3) While posing as the representatives of tiie Prince of Peace, they have sanctified war, openly advised, encouraged and advocated the same, and by appealing to the patriotism of the people have induced them to engage in war; they have wrongfully preached the men into the trenches, caused them to fight and die, have filled the land with a host of widows and orphans, and thereby increased the sorrow and suffering of mankind.—Romans 13:9; Matthew 26:52; Hebrews 12:14; Galatians 6:10; Luke 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(4) They have with selfish design invaded the schools, colleges, seminaries and universities with their God-dishonoring doctrines of higher criticism and evolution, have led the people into gross error and destroyed the faith or multitudes in the inspired Word of God.— Jeremiah 12:10,12; 13:13,14; 5:25,30; 8: 9,11; 9:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(5) They have spurned the true teachings of Jesus and the apostles, have scattered the flock of God and produced a famine in the land for the hearing of the Word of the Lord, and caused the hungry and thirsty to starve for spiritual food.—Amos 8:11; Psalm 107:4,5; Ezekiel 34:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;(6) They have hated the light and the bearers of the light (Matthew 5:14), refused to give meat to the hungry and drink to the thirsty Christian, turned away the stranger, failed to minister to the sick, persecuted and caused to he imprisoned honest and faithful Christians, resorted to deeds of violence against peaceable and order-loving Christians, and *on their skirts is found the blood of the souls of poor innocents/—Jeremiah 2:34; Matthew 25: 42, 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“(7) They have wilfully repudiated and rejected the teachings of Jesus and the apostles concerning the Lord’s second coming and the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth for the blessing of the people, and have substituted therefor a man-made, Satan-directed league of nations which they hail as the savior of mankind and as the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, thus blaspheming His name and cause. They have taken counsel together against the Lord and His kingdom, which counsel Jehovah declares shall not stand.—Psalm 2:1-12; Isaiah 8:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Furthermore we hold and declare that of those described in the second class there is a multitude of the peace- and order-loving ones in the denominational churches, both Catholic and Protestant, who have held and yet hold to their faith, who have been kind and considerate with and respected the faith of their fellows</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">regardless of creed or denomination, have fed the hungry and given drink to the thirsty, have taken in the stranger, clothed the naked, visited the sick and ministered to those wrongfully imprisoned, all in the name of our Lord; that these have hope in the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ and its attending blessings; and that for such the Lord has declared His love. —Matthew 25:3140. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>rf</sup>We point to the fact that God through His Word has declared His vengeance against all unrighteousness and particularly against the present evil order (Isaiah 34:14,8); that the Lord Jesus is now invisibly present judging the nations of earth; that the end of the world has come and the dashing to pieces of Satan's empire is in progress (Matthew 24:7-14); and that all who willingly ally themselves with Satan and his organization shall suffer at Jehovah's hand a terrible punishment; that those espousing the righteous cause of the Lord and faithfully serving Him shall pass through the trouble and receive boundless blessings (Zephaniah 2: 2,3; Zechariah 13:8,9; Psalm 41:1,2); that the line of demarcation between the two classes of Christendom is clearly drawn and the time has come for the separation of those who prefer evil from those who love righteousness and desire the Lord's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“We, therefore, in the spirit of love sound the warning to all such peace- and order-loving and God-fearing ones who are associated with the denominational churches, and point them to the fact that they can have no part in nor fellowship with that class of pretending<sub>f</sub>Chris-tians who repudiate the Word of God and deny the Lord Jesus Christ and His kingdom; and we call upon them to heed the Word of God and separate themselves from the unclean thing (2 ‘ Corinthians 6:17), to withdraw themselves from the unrighteous ecclesiastical systems designated by the Lord as Babylon, and to come out from her, lest they be partakers of her sins and receive of her plagues (Bevela-. tion 18:4); and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;We appeal to all such to recognize Jesus Christ as King of kings and Lord of lords and that His kingdom now at hand is the hope and salvation of the peoples; and that they individually and collectively declare themselves on the side of the Lord and in sympathy with His cause, and be ready to receive the blessings of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God's kingdom, which He has prepared for them from the foundation of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Armageddon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE greatest crisis of the ages is upon tho nations of earth. It therefore becomes the solemn duty of all Christians to sound the alarm. Concerning this day Jehovah said: ‘Sound an alarm ... let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord is nigh at hand.' (Joel 2:1) It is likewise important to point the people to the divine solution of the world’s perplexing problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;As a result of the World War the nations are bankrupt and the flower of humanity has gone into the grave. Selfishness, fraud, profiteering and hatred are ever on the increase, making the burdens of humanity unbearable. Distrust, perplexity and fear have taken hold upon men in all walks of life. The nations are feverishly preparing for war, and are vying with each other in producing the most devilish and deadly instruments of destruction.' Internal disturbances increase daily. The fiery volcano rumbles and roars and ever and anon breaks forth into flame. Many cry, Teace, peace,' when there is no peace. Thoughtful men of the world sense the approaching horrors and speak of them in no uncertain terms. From <sub>t </sub>some we quote: ‘There is no settlement in Europe. There is no peace in Europe. Governments can do nothing. They are afraid to do anything and they stand by and allow things to go from bad to worse.- 1923 is worse than 1914.’—Ramsay MacDonald, M. P. ‘A new chapter opens in the history of Europe and the world, with a climax of horror such as mankind hag never yet witnessed.'—Lloyd George. ‘No man unless he is drunk with optimism can deny that the world is very sick, and it may be a sickness unto death.'—Sir Philip Gibbs. j think it is certain that if there be another such war again civilization will never recover from it? —Viscount Grey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Reason &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HY, in this period of the world's greatest enlightenment, do we find the people in such distress and perplexity! Jehovah through His prophet answers: ‘Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people; let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies. . . . For it is the ’day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of the recompences for the controversy of Zion? (Isaiah 34:1,2,8) But why God's indignation? Because the old world has ended. Satan’s empire has come to its full in wickedness, the time for its fall and the establishment of the Kingdom of Righteousness is here. But how may we know that this is true? The prophets of God foretold the events as we now see them. Jesus had informed His disciples that in due time the old world would end, that He would return and set up the kingdom of God, which would bless the people of earth. With these thoughts in mind the disciples propounded to Jesus the question: 'Tell us when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?’ The answer of Jesus was given in prophetic phrase; that is to say, He foretold what we should expect to transpire at the time implied by the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“For many years Bible Students have been telling the people that a great change in the world’s affairs would begin in 1914. They based their conclusion upon the fact that God overthrew Israel in 606 B. C.; that there began the Gentile Times; that through His prophets He indicated that the Gentile dominion should continue without interruption for the period of 2,520 years and then the Lord Jesus, whose right it is, would take unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hims</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">elf </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> power and reign. It is easy to see that this period must end in 1914. We should, therefore, expect at the end of the Gentile Times the old order to begin to pass away. Answering the question propounded to Him, Jesus said: 'The nations will be angry and God’s wrath is come.’ 'Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom’; and this shall be followed by pesti-. lence, famines and revolutions in various parts of the earth, which will mark the beginning of the downfall of the old order. (Matthew 24:7) Exactly on time in 1914 these things began to come to pass and in regular and progressive order famines, pestilence and revolutions have followed the World War. As further evidences of the time, Jesus declared that God’s favor would begin to return to the people of Israel;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that there would be a great persecution of Christians; that there would be a great falling away of Christians from the faith once delivered to* the saints; that upon earth there would be distress of nations with perplexity; that men’s hearts would be failing them for fear because of what they see coming upon organized society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prophecies Fulfilled</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230926_files/g_E_19230926-2.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LL of these prophecies of Jesus have been fulfilled. God’s favor began to be especially marked toward the Jew in 1918; about the same time there was a great persecution of Christians in Europe and America, which persecution was instigated by apostate clergymen. Now we mark a great falling away from the faith. Modernists, claiming to be Christians, are denying the inspiration of the Scriptures, denying the fall of man, the redemption by our Lord’s sacrifice and the coming of His kingdom. These faith-destroying doctrines have invaded the schools, seminaries, colleges and universities. Another branch of the denominational church is known as Fundamentalists; and these are they who believe that the Bible is God’s Word of truth, and that redemption of man comes only through Christ Jesus. While these two factions are fighting between themselves the perplexity of the people increases. Therefore, we see that faith in God’s Word is terribly shaken, internal destruction threatens the nations, while all the nations themselves are gathering their forces and preparing for war. Naturally the people ask: {Where are the nations headed? What shall we expect?’ We answer: All the nations are marching to the great battle of Armageddon, and there they shall fall to rise no more as unrighteous nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Armageddon Defined</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RMAGEDDON means the great and final conflict between right and wrong, truth and error, God foreshadowed this in dealing with Israel That which transpired with Israel foreshadowed like events to transpire in Christendom on a far greater scale. Armageddon was the great battlefield of Palestine. There Gideon and his little army put to flight the Midianites, who in their distress and excitement destroyed each other. Gideon and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">bin </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">band typified the Christ, while the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Midijmi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tAg</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pictured the contending hosts of Christendom. Jehovah, through His prophet, foretelling the gathering of the nations to Armageddon, said: ‘Assemble yourselves and come, all ye nations, and gather yourselves together round about . . . Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat [Valley of Graves]: for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about . . . The Lord also shall roar out of Zion . . . and the heavens [eccle-siasticism] and the earth [organized society! shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of his people/—Joel 3:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Could It Be Averted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">S THEBE no possible way to avert the battle of Armageddon T Five years ago it was possible; now it is impossible. Jesus gave the clear evidence, which should have been proof conclusive to all pretending Christians, as well as real ones, concerning His second presence, the end of the world and the establishment of His kingdom. Had the clergy and the principal of their docks taken heed to Jesus' words (Matthew 24:7-14) and told the people the truth; had the profiteers ceased defrauding the people and dealt righteously with them; had the politicians faithfully represented the people, and had all these accepted the testimony of Jesus and yielded to the establishment of His kingdom, the great trouble just ahead would have been averted. (Jeremiah 18:8; 23: 19-22; 26:12,13) Due warning was given; they failed to heed the warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gathering for the Battle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE are three factors assembling the nations to the great battle or Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In symbolic phrase the Lord described it thus: ‘And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. . . . And he gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon/—Revelation 16:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Dragon</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> means the devil’s organization arrayed against Christ’s kingdom, seeking the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">destruction of it (Psalm 2:2,3) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Beast</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> symbolically represents selfish world powers wickedly controlled by the influence of Satan, ruling by military or other force. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">False prophet</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> sym- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark36"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bolically means religious systems claiming to</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark38"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Him and His power and, in fact, representing</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark39"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the devil. They sanctify war, advocate violence and pronounce a benediction upon the unright-.</span></a></p>

These are <sup>;</sup> , doctrines of the devil sent forth for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding the people^ •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The doctrines or messages of these three evil organizations may be briefly summed up as follows: ‘Give no heed to the teachings that the kingdom of Christ is at hand; those who ’ advocate such are enemies of the government and should be destroyed. (Psalm 2:3) A great • league or world court is the one way to safeguard the rights of the people; the present constituted authorities are ruling by divine right. Therefore let all the people patriotically ' and religiously support the present order and refuse to yield to the kingdom of Christ. All must support our religious system, which has joined hands with big financiers, profiteers and • big politicians. We must sanctify war and prepare for war in times of peace; and all the people must patriotically support war regard- , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">less of the cause/ While these three thus boast- , -fully claim to know the only way to rule’man- \ kind the nations because of fear are madly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">preparing for war; and thus, as God foretold, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">they are hastening on to the great battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Christ, the antitypical Gideon, is now turning the light on the nations of 'Christendom/ typified by the Midianites, exposing their unrighteousness. The light of truth is frightening them and they are madly rushing to the • great conflict Sober-minded men of the world see the impending world-battle between the nations. They note the strife between the radical and conservative elements; between capital</span></p>

Sir John Foster says: *It is enough to make the angels weep that after the greatest tragedy the world has ever known the nations should be showing their teeth more in 1923 than they did in 1913.’ Mr. Warden of the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mail</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> says: 'The next war will last but a few days.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. &quot;Describing this conflict Jesus said: 'Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.’ (Matthew 24:21,22) His testimony is corroborated by that of the prophets.—Daniel 12:1; Jer. 25:32,33; Psalm 107:25-30; Hag. 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Result</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS great conflict will be sharp and quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s empire will fall. The Beast and the False Prophet, including those pretended Christians particularly described by our Lord as 'goats/ will suffer a like punishment to that which is to be inflicted upon Satan, while the people who pass through the trouble will be symbolically slain, that is to say, brought under subjection to the Lord by the message of truth. —Revelation 19:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Escape '</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EEING this trouble rapidly approaching many will ask: Ts it possible to escape it; and, if so, how?* Jehovah answers thus: 'Before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you, seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger?—Zephaniah 2:2-4.</span></p>

These pretended religious systems have become unclean and the habitation of evil spirits, with which true Christians can have no -part nor fellowship. Therefore let all who love Jehovah and the Lord Jesus and believe the Bible as true, heed the words of the Master directed against the unrighteous systems: 'Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues?—Revelation 18:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Divine Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ORLD peace will be established only by the Prince of Peace, whose kingdom is now here. (Isaiah 9:6,7) The God of heaven is now setting up His kingdom that shall stand forever. (Daniel 2:44) The time has come for truth to triumph. Those who deliberately ally themselves with Satan and his evil organization and fight against the Lord and His kingdom shall suffer destruction. (Matthew 25:41-46) All who willingly ally themselves with the Lord ; and His kingdom and who obey righteousness shall be granted the blessings of life everlasting.— Zephaniah 3:8, 9; Ezekiel 18:27, 28; John 8:51; 11:26; Acts 3:19-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In the name of Christ, the King of kings now present, I call upon all peace- and orderloving people, who have faith in God and in His kingdom, to separate themselves from the wicked systems dominated and controlled by selfish and apostate men and to take their stand firmly upon the Lord’s side. Thus doing and becoming obedient to the Lord’s will, they may pass through the great time of trouble and be of the millions now living on the earth who will never die, and who will inherit the kingdom which God has prepared for them from the foundation of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>War or Peace—Which? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Beast Wants More Wab—The Common People Desire Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Beast is a Scripturally symbolic term applied to world power, made up of three elements, the predominating onq in our day being big business, supported by professional politicians and an apostate olergy. Another prophet describes the combination as shepherds or clergy and the principal of their flock, using religion as a cloak for their real motives. The beast is really the governing factors of the nations of earth, otherwise described as the kings and nobles of earth. Kings do not mean merely men who wear crowns, but those who really control the nations. The masses of the nations are known as common people. The common people never do want war. They want to be let alone, to follow peace and enjoy the comforts of home. The master mind behind the ruling factors is Satan, the god of this world* He sees his power rapidly waning; and he causes the governing factors who exercise the greater influence to cry out from various vantage points: &quot;The old order of things in this world is the only thing that can safeguard the interests of the people. It must not be disturbed, The people should patriotically support the old order.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This old order of things, say the false religionists, is the political expression of God's kingdom on earth; therefore the people should support it In order to induce the common people to be submissive to his unrighteous rule Satan stirs up various kinds of trouble, such as Bolshevism and other forms of radicalism, and uses these to induce the people to believe that they must stand solidly behind the order that now exists so as to preserve their interests and rights. War is a means of appealing to their patriotism. It serves as an excuse to enact and enforce conscription laws; and thus Satan in his desperation is urging his representatives to another war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some months ago Mr. Fred Smith of the ‘Johns-Manville Company of New York city was selected by the Federal Council of Churches and the World Alliance for International Friendship and Good Will to make a tour of the world and to report his findings. On Sunday afternoon, June 3, 1923, Mr. Smith addressed a session of the annual convention of ’Associated Advertising Clubs of the World at</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Atlantic City. Many of the expressions used by Mr. Smith in this speech were studiously avoided by the metropolitan press. The following quotations from his speech were taken by, a reporter who was present, and who is thoroughly reliable and vouches for the correctness of the statements here published. The quotations are all from the copy furnished by the reporter in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Frequently during his address Mr. Smith used the expression: &quot;The common people cry for peace.&quot; This he stated was the sentiment of the masses in all of the nineteen nations he visited. Then with great force he added: &quot;However, I am compelled to say there are rumblings everywhere that more war is on the way. Out of the nineteen nations I visited sixteen are actually preparing for another war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I am simply stating the facts. Europe today _ is a seething vortex of jealousies, misunderstandings and ominous rumblings of threatening revenge. There hardly seems to be any nation in Europe satisfied with the verdict of November 11, 1918, or with the Versailles Treaty or with anything that has been done since. Most of them are feeling that they have been wronged and that the only way to remedy the present situation is to resort to arms. In making this statement I am not undervaluing the beneficent influence of certain activities which are now ‘carrying on'; and I am not belittling the work of the League of Nations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Again continuing along the same line, Mr. Smith specifically and with great force stated: &quot;The common people cry for peace, but the inside people [evidently meaning the rulers] say, ' More war.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerning India he said: &quot;While the Hindoos are taught not to destroy any life, they are now saying, Tt looks like we will have to go to war like you Christians? &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Smith himself was not advocating war; but discussing the world situation further he * said: &quot;Our issue now is before the altar of ■ human justice. The' supreme issue is, Can we find any way by which war can be averted! -We </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ericans say that we won the war. In ** all the other nineteen nations they say we got -rich out of it. I say that we are living in a kind of-fool's paradise. Under the slogan of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">aie</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">preparedness</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the militarists everywhere are again precipitating a deluge of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> would like to ma</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ke</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> all of my countrymen [</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ericans! really alarmed about war ahead. We have not made war terrible enough. The fact is we still put too much halo about war. Let us tear off the mask.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then discussing rules to forestall war, Mr. Smith added: &quot;First, send no young men to war. Second, send only old men to war. Third, every man that voted for war should be sent to the front to carry a gun.” This last statement brought forth a most terrific applause of the advertising delegates. Then as a further suggestion to prevent war and its devastating effects, Mr. Smith with great vehemence cried out: &quot;Bally the church! Bally the church! Bally the church! We have tried the politicians. We have tried the newspapers. For God’s sake let us try the Christian church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus do men flounder about and, even though with an honest purpose, imagine a vain thing. We are here forcibly reminded of the words of the Psalmist: &quot;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing! The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.” (Psalm 2:1,2) The marginal reading of this Psalm is: &quot;Why do the nations tumultuously assemble!” And thus we see them doing. And the people are imagining a vain thing, that international conference and the nominal church can save the day. The Lord answers: &quot;I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion”; thus stating that the time has come when the Lord Jehovah through Christ Jesus is taking possession of the affairs of earth. The King is here. His kingdom has begun. It is the only remedy for the deplorable conditions of the world. Big business, big politicians and big preachers fail to learn the lesson that Jesus taught concerning the war and its effects. The Lord Jehovah through His prophet further advises them, saying, &quot;Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.”—Psalm 2:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Instead of heeding this, under Satan’s direction they are rapidly gathering the people to another great conflict, described in the Scriptures as Armageddon. (Revelation 16:13-16) It is time for the common people to heed the words of Jehovah. To such, speaking through His prophet, He said: &quot;Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you.* Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek qf the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.&quot;—Zephaniah 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The cry for war on behalf of the commercial and political power, joined in by the clergy, is to force the peoples of earth to accept and endorse the League of Nations, which League long ago foretold in the prophecies is a form of Satanic government for the purpose of controlling mankind in opposition to the Messianic kingdom. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Toronto) quoting Rev. Dr. S. D. Chown, General Superintendent of the Methodist Church in Canada, says: &quot;The nations of Europe appear to be dancing a dance of death upon the very verge of a moral volcano, whose eruption may at any moment lay civilization in its ashes and us in our graves. Between mankind and the possibilities of momentary destruction stands no organized opposition but the League of Nations, fortified by the conscience of Christian people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Chown further said that he had been authorized by the General Conference Special Committee to urge each Methodist minister and probationer to preach upon the subject of ‘World Peace* He continued: &quot;The very existence of a League of Nations, is a direct and inescapable challenge to the Church of Christ to realize its divine function as the representative of the Prince of Peace; and shouM it fail at this crucial time, it will add immensely to its indisputable responsibilities and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> down in history meriting and receiving the condemnation, if not the execration, of mankind/<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Big business wants war; and they will get it in the great conflict of Armageddon foretold by the Lord. The common people want peace; and they will get it after the war and trouble are over. The Lord has given this premise when He says: &quot;I will shake all nations, and [then] the desire of all nations shall come.&quot; —Haggai 2:7.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Plight of Christendom </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By J. W. Reimer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> HAVE for some time been persuaded that nothing less than a shock will change the process of thinking, mental tendencies, and actions of this degenerating world. Deliberate stoicism of the sentiments and stifling of the reason are resorted to when reform is mentioned. Optimism gives the mind a bed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of ease to</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> rest upon, but never alters any existing condition. Optimism blocks action by a systematic method of self-deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This is especially true in the formation and breaking of injurious habits. After deliberating upon the impropriety of a course of action, the power of nerve cravings and the deep-rooted mental attitudes overcome the desire to follow sane reasoning; and the individual sinks back into the polluting practices against which a slumbering sense has for the moment been excited into action. The gigantic problem is how to get past the crisis of resisting tendencies, and to break in cultivated habits which carry the being along channels of wisdom, justice, and love. The power to accomplish thia should receive careful attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The mind and body are inseparable, and one must react upon the other. Ill health and diseased organs, through the instinctive efforts of self-preservation, drive men and women to seek diversions, and are a potent factor in the polluting of the higher sentiments of man; and the poisons generated by fear, pride, anger, and vice, only steep the character in greater degeneracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Few succeed in tearing away from the deep-seated habits of thought and practice; and the developed, routine responses of cultivated senses fasten upon the being with great permanence. The majority factor of contact with other beings, similarly affected, deepens the impressions of established tendencies upon the brain. Therefore nothing but a terrific reverse ing of human tendencies, by shocking repulsions, can get society started up the “highway” to “holiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Corrupting Practice* Aggravated</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">H E corrupting contamination of vile thoughts and of evil designs has made the world a seething, cantankerous mass, which sends its polluting streams into every nook and corner of human activity. The purification of this mass can be accomplished only by purging it with such impressions as will bring about the needed reactions. That the strength of thia arresting force will be sublimely powerful can be grasped by a glance at the present condition of human affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. As it is, the inertia of human passions carries this seething mass into ever-quickening pulsations of corrupting practices. It is as if a gigantic engine had lost its engineer and was plunging onward with maddening speed, burning out the bearings and paving the way for its own destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Human society is sinking into an abyss; and the surrounding, threatening clouds and surging waves of hatred and resentment encircle its waning powers of resistance, to engulf it in their fathomless depths. The next social order must be essentially new, from foundation to pinnacle; for so great will be the revulsion against the old order that in the fabrication of the new human endeavor will not permit the welding of anything having the least taint of a spirit which created its own destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Is this then a hopeless condition? It is, from the human standpoint; and the efforts of six thousand years to extricate society from this destructive effect, caused by the violation of the divine laws, stands as an eternal witness of the helplessness of man. The despondency created by this hopelessness finds expression in the numerous homicides and suicides, vicious habits and degenerated morals. The divine remedy is the only solution, and in the promises of God’s Word is the only hope. And this is a golden hope. Its effects are triumphant in producing a living faith, which looks with longing expectancy to the culmination of the divine processes, which will eventuate in the perfecting of the holy spirit of Jehovah God in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Human Effort* due for</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jolt &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN the brakes are put on, the train of human events will be jolted by the concussion of the onward rushing wheels of “progress in the wrong direction.” The jarring of self-satisfied security and mental tranquillity produces action. This mental attitude is well illustrated by an incident occurring in Chester, Pa., when a bridge collapsed and a number of people were drowned, due to the rusting of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Bbptekbbb 26, 1923</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bupports. Immediately action was secured in Philadelphia on defective bridges, same being closed to traffic, and the needed repairs made. But it required a shock to get the action. The World War was a shock. A few were awakened by it, but many still require a more vivid impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The instincts of man have been measurably diverted; for they are subject to the diversion which the intellect may place upon them. Had man been obedient to God He would, no doubt, have guided these instincts into correct channels of culture, until such a time as the development of intellect in the human family had reached a point where the control of all the instincts would have produced the most favorable results, and trained the cell cultures of the body to tune up with the responsive chords of God's spirit, and coordinate with the laws of man’s Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Better times will come when the simple laws are obeyed. The lesson that tjieir violation is destructive has not yet shocked the world into putting them into practice. &quot;Thou shalt not kill” is accepted as a formula; but murder is legalized by destructive wars. &quot;Thou shalt not steal,” the preacher says; but he condones the stealing of millions by clever business trickery. &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods” is praised as pious; but grabbing the lands of the weaker peoples by the stronger is the order of the day. &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness” is a statute upon the law books; but the &quot;lying press” is a by-word in the mouth of millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every now and then there appears a shaft of light amidst the encircling gloom, as the divine judgments force submission in some matter. The shadows of future things awe reflected in the glare. “Self-determination of nations” is .the cry; and then the flash is swallowed up in gloom. &quot;We will not war upon our fellow Russian workmen,” British Labor shouts; and silence reigns. Another cry, &quot;Let us disarm”; and the shroud of black enfolds it Still another flash, and the candles of the Greek Orthodox Church go out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A bright light is arising: it is the Sun of Righteousness. A two-edged sword is flashing: it is the truth. The spirit of the truth, because of its wonderful results, will finally be the dominating factor in human affairs. Let all who wish to escape the retributive method of correction by a just God begin to cultivate in their hearts, right now, &quot;the Spirit of the Truth.” .</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UR political, social, religious and industrial system is now passing through the most critical period of its existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In every line of private endeavor this is visibly apparent; and the deplorable conditions existing are wholly due to the fact that representative government has been cleverly and astutely taken from the hands of the people. The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial personnel is controlled absolutely by an interlocking of fiscal agents, comprising the most vicious money oligarchy the world has ever witnessed. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This oligarchy is decidely non-partisan to the extent that it nominates (under the corrupt convention system) the Presidential candidates of both major parties and with the explicit under-Btanding that their wishes in congress, executive office and court are to be served first and to the letter. Thus are destroyed every right and possibility of suffrage, as the people have only destructive equals from which to make their choice at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The thoroughness with which this monopoly eystem is entrenched is the sad commentary which casts gloom upon all who hope to perpetuate our institutions as founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thorough explanation here would require many pages of print; but briefly stating, there is not a single industry of note (except Ford’s), corporation, bank, agricultural college, chamber of commerce, nor seat of learning that is riot directly connected with the twelve banks constituting the monopoly, and now generally termed the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to maintain a system of this magnitude every avenue of information, inclusive of the Radio, is controlled to the extent that the truth of a state, national or international question cannot reach the people.

With this completely controlled, as it is today, Christ appealing for peace, justice, and a return to the policies of Washington and Lincoln, would be vilified in the columns of nearly every daily news medium in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The vilification of Senator La Follette in nearly every daily paper in the United States because of an editorial in his magazine dealing with the machinations of the monopoly just described is an example of their ability to persecute effectively any representative who will not yield to their policy of absolute control of government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ninety-five percent of candidates for office upon a specific platform for relief of economic conditions are defeated and politically ruined by continued vilification through the daily press, which the monopoly controls; therefore, how can government of the people by the money and poHtical action be restored </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The answer to this important question can be found by turning to the policies of Washington and Lincoln, and the solution is quite easy. But the adoption of the same when every source of learning, of finance and of information except through The Golden Age, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nation, La Follette's Magazine,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Searchlight, Dearborn Independent,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Call</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and three or four smaller publications, is controlled as described, the task ranks with the impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It would be possible, however, if Congress would abolish the National Convention (the key to oligarchy control), abolish electors, and permit the people to choose and elect the President, Congressmen and members of the Supreme Court in the November elections. It would be possible if laws could be passed taking from Congress the right to declare war and leave this to a Referendum vote of the people and forbidding vilification and personal attack, through the press, radio, or movie, upon any citizen without publishing or displaying a verbatim copy of the position such citizen has taken on the questions at issue, so that the peo-pie could have opportunity for the formation of a correct opinion whereupon they could decide who is the guilty party in the case. Furthermore, a newspaper or magazine, in order to continue as such, should be compelled by law to publish. free, as news, the platform of each candidate in a fair and impartial maimer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Congress at the eleventh hour, which is near, reconstruction would be thorough and consummated with quick dispatch; the masses then, for the first time, would individually enjoy strict equality with each person of the Monopoly class. Consequently wars and preparation therefor would be heard of no more in civilized countries; for no war ever received the support of the masses until false propaganda and force were applied by the monopoly class at least on the one side and wholly for the purpose of territorial expansion, oppression or general profiteering. The teachings of Christ were never taken into consideration, and the dollar, not human lives, has always been the unit of value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Most important of all, the people would be and with effect, the only just and legal means of correcting county, state, national or international conditions, and could thus select and elect, in one day, for President of the United States some public-spirited man who is independent of the money ring and who has recognized statesmanship ability. They could select a man who has upheld the policy of Washington and Lincoln in their fight against foreign alliances such as is embodied in the League of Nations, Four-Power Pact and World Court; who has fought or will fight for a neutrality, which would have kept us out of the World War; one who is against the Esch-Cummins Kailroad Law and the Ship Subsidy, and who would return the government to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Unless such timely action is taken by Congress, Coolidge, or perhaps Underwood (exact equals as viewed by the Monopoly), will be elected under the corrupt convention system, whereupon Monopoly will have a greater strangle hold, such as is necessary in the adoption of a complete military despotism, designed for greedy profiteering, the summit of autocratic control.

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E MAY not be too sure as to the cause of President Harding’s death. The statement accredited to the associate editor of &gt;&nbsp;the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Commercial</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> that he died from &quot;mental assassination” due to the growth of ' radicalism in the United States may be set . down as sheer nonsense. The possession by <sup>?</sup> others of opinions different from one’s own never killed anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite as liable to be nonsense is the idea</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that has been widely circulated that he worked </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">self to death. It is open to question whether any man ever worked h</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ims</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">elf to death. Without doubt the presidential office is hard to fill, although Mr. Roosevelt made the statement that he &quot;liked the job,” and it is noteworthy : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that most presidents seek reelection, which they</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' would hardly be likely to do if the position were distasteful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We are not so sure that there is any truth in the suggestions of the anti-Catholic organs that he was put out of the way by the hier-. archy, though it is odd that some of these papers received preceding his death unsigned letters stating that he was to be put out of the -way. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fellowship Forum</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> claims to have received such a letter. Other such papers call <sup>1</sup> attention to the claim that Mrs. Coolidge is an . ardent Boman Catholic, and express wonder-<sup>1</sup> ment at President Harding’s narrow escape <sub>;</sub> from death in the automobile accident that killed one of his companions, and in the ramming of his boat by another boat in San Francisco harbor just before he began to show evi' - dence that he had been poisoned. It is claimed that three days before his death there was a Western Union despatch received in Pittsburgh stating that he was dead, and that when qties-, tioned on the subject the Western Union people ‘ refused either to deny or to affirm. Mr. Harding was a Mason; so also, we understand, was Mr. Thomas Watson, the famous anti-Catholic sen, ator from Georgia, who also died recently under circumstances not unlike those attending <sup>1</sup> the death of Mr. Harding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It may be that Mr. Harding’s death came as ' an act of God, a determination on the part of ■ the Almighty to cut short his efforts to draw p the United States into the World Court, the back-door entrance into the League of Nations. J It will be recalled that President Wilson was</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">stricken while in the far West on a similar errand. The words of the Prophet, &quot;Say ye not, A confederacy” (Isaiah 8:12), come with the force of a command at this time, and are evidently backed with the power of God. The American people by an overwhelming majority ordered President Harding to keep out of European affairs; big business has been and still is determined to get this country in, and uses its great influence accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is talk of providing an Assistant President who shall have power to take from the shoulders of his chief much of the routine, thus leaving the time of the chief more free to grapple with the larger questions that come to him. This seems to us like a good plan, if such an assistant is made responsible to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">President Harding was one of the best loved men in American public life. He did not claim to have outstanding ability; he even acknowledged that there was no particular reason why he should be President; but he was genial, kindly, well-meaning, and tried, as far as &quot;he could, to please everybody. This disposition of trying to please everybody was perhaps his greatest handicap. Those who make their voices most heard and their influence most felt at Washington are the moneyed interests of New York; it is impossible to do as they wish, and as they insist, and to do as the plain people wish and as justice demands. President Harding was acknowledged, even by his critics, as modest, patient, considerate, and trying to be fair-minded and disinterested. He was not wilful, overbearing, cold and autocratic, as have been some of his predecessors in the high office which he occupied. He was not a natural leader, but rather tried from day to day to adjust America to its new and difficult positions by using the plans and methods of long ago. He was said to be eager to retire to private life and to have aged rapidly while in his position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Harding sensed the value of the Christian life. In his last talk he urged Christianity in language rather unusual for an American president to put forth in a public speech. He said, as reported in the press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I tell you, my countrymen, the world needs more of the Christ; the world needs more of the spirit of the Man of Nazareth. If we could bring into t</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">he</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> relationships of humanity, among ourselves and among the nations &lt;rf the earth, the brotherhood that was taught</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by the Christ, we- would have a restored world; we would have little or none of war, and we would have a new hope for humanity throughout the globe. There never was a greater lesson taught than that of the Golden Rule. If we could have that one faithfully observed, I would be willing to wipe out the remainder of the commandments. I should like to say further that if we are going to make of this America of ours all that the fathers sought, if we are goin^ to make it true to the institutions for which they builded, we must continue to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">main</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tain religious liberty. As you remember, we builded on the foundation of civil liberty, and we capped that with the stone of human liberty, and the third fundamental was religious liberty. The United States never can afford to deny religious freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">President Harding’s failure to insist on the immediate and unconditional liberation of all political prisoners, and the consequent death of many of these poor fellows in prison while their semi-orphaned children suffered for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">necessities of life, five years after every other country had released its political prisoners, will remain the greatest blot upon his name, greater even than his opposition to the bonus for the soldiers, or his lukewarm attitude to- 4 ward labor. No doubt he did what he believed to be for the best interests of the people as a _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">whole, or at least he did the best that he could n! under the circumstances in which he found himself placed It requires tremendous courage and great ability to discharge properly the duties of president of this great country. No\. president ought to be harshly criticised who ’ ' does the best he can for the whole people, and especially should such criticism be mild when so kind and genial a man as Mr. Harding finds the office a burden and ends his days trying to carry the burdens which fortune fastened upon his shoulders.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Reports From Foreign Correspondents</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE English farmers have now got in a good proportion of their wheat, oats, and barley crops, and have found that they have done fairly well Owing to lack of sunshine in the Spring it'was feared that the crops would suffer and the farmers get but a poor return for their labor—at least that was what the newspapers said. Probably the papers were supplied with the paragraphs by one of the agencies that they allow to supply them with news and that make it their business to report or if necessary to invent items of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Creator continues to manifest His goodness and loving-kindness towards men, even as St. Paul said, in giving rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. (Acts 14:17) Ruskin said: &quot;Nature is cruel, red in tooth and claw.” That is partly true of the animal world, of man and beast; but nature is kind and lavish in its gifts to man and beast What it will be when it is free to give, when not restrained by the embargo laid upon it because of the sin of man and the consequent necessity of making him toil, we can only imagine. It is certain that the fields will smile with the blessings of heaven upon them, yielding their full measure of increase. (Psalm 67:6) The prophet Ezekiel tells us that famine is one of God’s weapons against evil If God does permit that terrible thing to come upon the earth in the near future, either by the conditions which man has produced and which prevent the transportation of food from the country of production to the people who need it, or, as may be, by the positive withholding of the blessings of nature, yet when the lessons are learned men will thank Him because they will realize the love which caused the Father’s hand to smite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ain interesting item was noted recently. In a market produce-farming district there were in the fields around two crops of peas growing^ one to come to the ripenirfg about two to thre* weeks after the other so as tqjceep the markets supplied in proper course. But a very sharp electric storm brought the second crop to maturity; that is, it caused it to jump two weeks development. Not very pleasing to the farmers, who had to employ extra labor and at the same time glut the market and so reduce their profits; but interesting to the community as a possible example of what may be done to quicken nature’s growth. Electricity has been proven to be of advantage in the development of seeds and of plant life, but this is the first instance we have heard of on so large a scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The outlook for the winter is depressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Trade does not improve, and there are no prospects of improvement. On the other hand, with lessened purchasing power at home and the foreign markets sending few orders to Britain, and conditions preventing even those few from being accepted, there are no reasons for expecting any trade improvements. It is calculated that Britain will have 4,000,000 persons out of work in the coming winter. Suggestions are made which if carried out would ultimately provide work for 300,000; but even at present unemployment figures this still leaves 1,100,000 out of work. A prominent politician stated recently that there are in Britain 800,000 young men who have never done any work—a terrible condition and one which forebodes much evil during the next few years of sharp distress and trial which -must come with the further adverse conditions. In the meantime the seaside resorts have given themselves over to revelry. Carnivals are the order of the day. If these were the simple enjoyments of a happy people one might perhaps be glad to hear of them. But they are not that; rather they are days and nights of frivolity, throwing both young and older people into most ways of temptation. Outwardly the condition of things looks good. The streets and shops seem always crowded; railway trains are well filled and are running with pre-war loads and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">timi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ng; the seaside resorts are full to overcrowding. But by those who look ahead the specter of distress is plainly to be seen.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The Llano Estacado, or S</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ANY people, especially in the East, fancy the expansive Llano Estacado of western Texas, which reaches scores of miles into New Mexico length and width, to be a vast desert waste unfit for pasturage or cultivation, chiefly an extensive stretch of sand and alkali, and uninhabited by man. Such is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This vast territory is now under intensive cultivation and yielding good croppage, mostly cotton and corn. Much of it is very good pasture-land for cattle and sheep. It is fenced and cattle and sheep roam it by the thousands. The farms are largely 160-acre tracts. In some parts the ranches embrace upwards of many thousand acres, particularly in the western and ’ southern sections where the chief industry is stock-raising. Settlements are few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The reason why there are no railroads in the greater part of this gigantic plain lies in the fact that the Panhandle and Santa F6 railway system has the whole territory under business care; and why build new roads when it already gets all the trade, however inconvenient to the farmer to bring his stuff to the distant railroad points? When a competitive railroad line was proposed and work on it fairly under way, the Santa Fe got busy and built first to the prospective points; and the competitive line was promptly abandoned. If it is necessary (for the railroad business) for the farmer to have a railroad near his place he gets it, and not be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">taked Plains </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">B&amp; J. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Boknet</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fore. It is not necessary until the railroad company gets the greater benefit or is in danger of losing to some other concern. We all know how that works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Llano Estacado is a huge plain or tableland at the top of what is called Cap-rock, a 200- to 500-foot rock ridge bordering the plain on the eastern side. The lower land is broken with alternate plain and hill country dotted with mesquite, which somewhat resembles a neglected, unrowed peach orchard. It is the habitat of wolves and jack-rabbits with enough coyotes to make the night hideous with their yelpings. But all the yelping you hear may * emanate from the throat of a lone coyote, though you imagine at the time there must be a dozen or more of them in the chorus. One coyote can make more noise than a steam calliope in a circus parade, and not overdo </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">elf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Llano Estacado on certain days mirage after mirage appears. One sees water everywhere with trees, cattle, and dwellings plainly discernible therein; but there is no water. It is not an optical illusion, but a strange atmospheric phenomenon. The tenderfoot is willing to swear that he actually sees water, and a big lake at that, though he could no more find it than he could find the rainbow pot of gold. His visionary water persistently remains within a mile of him, travel as fast as he may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Clearest of Atmosphere</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS said throughout western Texas that only the tenderfoot and the fool will predict what the weather has in store. The old settler never does so; even if the sky be overcast with threatening rain clouds, or if the sky be cloudless. On short notice a great change may take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Llano the atmosphere is so clear that one can see a star rise and set'on the horizon. One can see about thirty percent more stars than elsewhere; and the milky way is a beautiful sight to behold in its vividness on a clear night after a storm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The atmospheric conditions on the Llano Estacado have changed during the past twenty years. Prior to fifteen years ago beef could hang out of doors any time of the year without putrif ying. It was a very common sight to sea beef or veal hung high up on windmill derricks everywhere, from which the families; would ent slices for coolring day by day as needed for table use. The cut part would sear over and not corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Animal a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">, on the,plains dying from lack of water or other causes would not decompose but would for months remain apparently in the same physical state. (There are no buzzards on the*plains.) But now there are blowflies; and dead animals decompose rapidly. Beef can no longer be kept for food by outhanging; whereas formerly a beef would hang out and remain fresh until the last pound was cut The Millennium may restore these conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Along the shores of the lakes there is a creature called the water dog. It somewhat resembles a lizard of slimy appearance. It grows to the length of two feet and is harmless. If tormented very much it may bite; and a milky fluid of bad odor comes through the skin of its body (as a full-grown horn toad emits jets of blood from its horn ends when rushed too hard or teased too much), used only as a means of defense in case of attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hardships to Encounter</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UCH of the Llano Estacado remains virgin . prairie of fine gramma and buffalo grasses, interspersed with wild flowers com-manly called weeds. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>T</sup>2£</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> rattlesnake may here and there be encountered; likewise the deadly centipede, tarantula, and stinging lizard, though there are few casualties from bites and stings of these creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The western portion of the plain is more sandy; and still more sandy is the southern portion, and of a lighter grade of sand. It has large patches of shindy (a shin-high post-oak growth) which in places attains a height of several feet It would grow higher but for want of moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Water is obtainable from drilled wells thirty to three hundred feet in depth. In some parts no water has been found by still deeper drillings. In other spots water is nearly at artesian stage. It is lack of rain that has kept back earlier settlement. The soil is highly productive where water can be had for irrigation purposes. Windmills are seen everywhere, but must be built for high velocity air-currents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many of the fanners had to replant their cotton and corn this season because of destructions by heavy hail and the sandstorms that covered up the young plants, and in places blew the plants out by the roots. Also there were rain floods which did much damage. In springtime the winds are fierce. This year the high winds came strongest in June, causing a serious drawback to farmers who had all their spring work to do over and at big expense of labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wheat reaches a height of generally twelve to eighteen inches when ready to harvest, and tis gathered with difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The towns of Lubbock and Plainview, on the eastern front, are a credit to any state. The people are of a high class and up to date on all points of industry and commercialism. There are no better schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Llano Estacado, as a whole, is a thriving expanse of industrial fruition. Land values* according to improvements, run from $20 to $200 per acre. It is practically free of ticks and chiggers. The homes are about like the average northern homes, but barns and outbuildings are very diminutive. Stock grazes out during winter, which obviates the use of barns. No individual is better represented on the plains than is Henry Ford. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>A Trip to The Thousand Islands</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E ARE about to take a trip together to the Thousand Islands. But instead of following the usual route we start off in the opposite direction, and before we arrive at our destination we shall visit some strange and interesting places. Our first stop is Bermuda, 681 miles southeast of New York, 580 miles east of North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Though popularly called Bermuda, the right name for the group of 360 coral islands which have Hamilton as their capital is The Bermudas. Although the total area of these islands is but 19.3 square miles, and only twenty of them are large enough to be inhabited, yet they constitute one of the garden spots of the world and are noted for their superb climate, scenery, and productiveness. Three crops a year of unexcelled onions and potatoes find their way into northern markets. The principal islands are connected by a system of roads and bridges which makes them practically one island. Thousands of New Yorkers visit Bermuda every winter to enjoy the mild weather which the location in the Gulf Stream assures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Bermuda our next stop is Havana, Cuba, 1,158 miles to the southwest. On the way we pass through the Bahamas, a string of islands hundreds in number, stretching from near the coast of Florida for a distance of seven hundred miles to the southeast. On one of these islands, once called San Salvador, now called Watling Island, Columbus first landed in the western world. The discoverers made slaves of the simple natives, and sent them to Central America to work in the mines. The total population of the twenty inhabited islands is 60,000; Nassau, the capital, is a center for the illicit rum traffic infesting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erican shores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the way to Havana from New York we may sometime be able to call at Welcome Island, to be constructed outside of the jurisdiction of the United States and all other nations, being in neutral waters. No criminals are to be allowed, no profiteers, and no bootleggers. The entire island as laid out by the office of W. C. Griesser, comprises two hotels of 4,200 sleeping rooms each, with the required dining rooms, grill rooms, meeting rooms, banquet and dancing halls, as well as all the rooms necessary for the comfort of the guest. The entire construction is to be substantial. Mr. Griesser believes that the most severe typhoon or upheaval of water can have no effect, as the island is to be of steel and concrete, not only resting on, but sunk into, the ocean floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cuba itself is the most productive island in the world, in some years producing one-half of the world’s sugar. The western end lies directly south of Fort Wayne, Indiana; the eastern end directly south of New York city. -There are several hundred small islets along the coast. Although nearly a thousand miles long the average width is less than fifty miles, making the total area about the size of Pennsylvania. A splendid day and night service of through express trains, equipped with Pullman sleeping-cars and dining-cars, covers the island?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Havana we go ninety-two’ miles north to Key West, which used to be an island, but which ceased to be one when the Florida East Coast railway connected it with the mainland by a succession of bridges and fills 107, miles long. This is the only place on the planet where one can take a sea trip of this length in a railway train. Ever since this railway was built we have been watching the papers to see it washed off into the Gulf Stream; but it is still there. Key West cigars are popular with the allied and amalgamated hay-burners' association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">West Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROM Key West we go to the center of the West Indies, San Juan, the capital of Porto</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230926_files/g_E_19230926-4.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rico, 966 miles to the southeast. Porto Rico is rectangular in shape, forty miles north and south by one hundred miles east and west. During the Spanish-American war its Spanish governor-general surrendered to the United States forces by long-distance telephone when he heard that Unde Sam's troops had landed on the island fifty miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I Near Porto Rico on the east are the Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, which Uncle Sam purchased from Denmark in 1917 for $25,000,000. These islands are now said to be wretchedly governed by American naval officers, with results that in six years have filled the 25,000 inhabitants with dissatisfaction, dismay, and almost despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the south are the Lesser Antilles, stretching five hundred miles, all the way to Trinidad off the mainland of South </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erirA. Trinidad is almost square in shape, about forty miles each way; it has a third of a million inhabi-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">au</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tants; in its center is the most famous asphalt 'deposit in the world. Most American cities are raved with Trinidad asphalt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the way back to San Juan we pass the French island of Martinique. A generation ago Mount Pelee, a volcano on the northern end of Martinique, suddenly erupted, destroying the *ntire population of the city of St. Pierre, which lay at its feet. St. Pierre has been rebuilt; its population in 1915 was 25,792. No 'disaster completely destroys the hope of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Porto Rico we head for the Panama Canal 1,029 miles away. On our right, as we speed through the Caribbean Sea, is the island of Haiti-San Domingo, whereon two Negro republics manage to live without swallowing each other, though Haiti has a hard time to keep from being swallowed by the big New York hankers that have it by the throat. The island is four hundred miles long, and over a hundred broad at the widest place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Farther on, to the right, is Jamaica, the size of Porto Rico, a cherished British possession, famous for sugar, molasses, and rum. Many hundreds of miles in the same direction from our track, off the coast of Louisiana, lies the island of Cote Blanche, of pure salt. The discovery that this island is of pure salt was made only two years ago. One would hardly have supposed that such an interesting discovery as to the nature of its soil could have lain unobserved so long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our course from Porto Rico through the Panama Canal is southwest. We are amused at the capers which nature has cut whereby the Pacific end of the canal is twenty-five miles farther east than the Atlantic end of the canal. We are interested when we learn that from New York it is a less distance via Panama to Hongkong, Shanghai, Yokohama, Melbourne, Sydney, or Wellington than by any other marine route, the average saving in miles to these points being 3,520 miles; also that from ports in the British Isles there is an average saving of 1,712 miles effected by routing the traffic to Yokohama, Melbourne, Sydney, and Wellington via Panama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">South Sea Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E KEEP right on into the Pacific in a southwest direction until we come to the Galapagos Islands, 864 miles from Panama, lying directly on the equator, 500 miles west of Ecuador. Scientists report that the most inter* esting detail of these islands is that the animals here show no fear of man. Reptiles of huge size do as they please; lizards grow to be four feet long; and turtles, each weighing several hundred pounds, enjoy eating dogs that come too near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This is our first stop in the South Sea Islands, as those of the South Pacific are commonly called. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> says of them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;No spot in the world is more refreshing to the tourist; for at every turn he will find a new, dean world of surprises; but if he remains he will become miserable nine times out of ten. Without community spirit, cluba, identity of interests, common purposes—without theatres, churches, games, libraries, congenial occupation and diversions—life becomes a bore. Large spiders, millions of ants, poison fish whose deadly prongs protrude from the sands along the beaches, dying foxe^ myriads of rats, some centipedes, and countless creeping things abound everywhere. The danger is not very great, but the discomfort is continuous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We are not visiting all the islands in the South Seas. One reason is that there are 930 large enough to be listed in the atlas; another is that some are hard to reach. Our next stop beyond the Galapagos Islands, going on in the same general direction, is the French island of Tahiti, a nice little jump of 3,1184 miles. The only reason we stop is that it is the crossroads of the South Pacific, a convenient port of call between Panama and Australian or New Zealand points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Half way between Galapagos and Tahiti, though a little matter of 1,150 miles off to the left of the track, is the famous Easter island, a penal settlement for Chile, from the shores of which it is distant 2,300 miles. Every once in a while some sea captain comes into port, and declares that Easter Island has disappeared. It has been reported missing many times, but always comes up smiling. This strip of land is the site of a weird collection of statues and monuments, some seventy feet high and weighing a hundred tons each. There is unmistakable evidence that the work of building the monuments was suddenly abandoned; for some are incomplete, others lying unmounted beside </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">platforms. It is possible that the flood of Noah’e day was the cause of their sudden abandonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our next stop is 1,301 miles west at Apia, in</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">duing their inheritance. Melbourne has a population of 591,830; Sydney, 621,100. Other large cities are Adelaide and 'Brisbane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We would have liked to go straight north from Sydney to the Solomon Islands, which raise tropical fruits for the Sydney markets; but it is 1,567 miles each way, and would be off our track. Hence we go 1,069 miles northwest to our next stop, Noumea, on the French island of New Caledonia; it is fertile and has valuable mineral deposits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Crossroads of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Pacific</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UR next jump is 3,351 miles from Noumea northwest to Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Half way from Sydney to Honolulu, but 700 miles to the left, is the tiny island of Nawoda, Nauru or Pleasant Island, lying almost on the equator. This tiny island contains millions of tons of phosphate rock, worth a fabulous amount. A mere pinch of this magic tropical product put upon the most impoverished soil has an amazing effect upon plant life. In Australia, where some 200,000 tons are used annually, the wheat crop has doubled. The natives of Nauru are renowned for their pleasant manners. They receive a few cents a day for digging up their inheritance and giving it over to the whites. Japan demands the island as a part of the Marshalls; but Britain already has it; and we have a photograph of Japan getting it, as it were. Britain feels that she is entitled to the most chance of making Christians out of those natives—while the phosphate rock lasts. It will be time enough for heathen nations like Japan to come around after the Christian nations are through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hawaiian Islands, of which there are twenty-two, are mere summits of volcanoes, several of them active. The Hawaiian Islands are exceedingly fertile and are blessed with a climate remarkably even and free from heat Though not previously unknown to the world, they were first visited and described </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Captain Cook in 1778. The population is now increasing rapidly; there are 150 miles of railroad on the islands, built since they were absorbed by the United States in 1898.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While we are at Honolulu it would be pleasant to run over to Santa Catalina Island, off the shore from Los Angeles; but the distance is 2,220 miles each way, and it would hardly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Samoan Islands, which once came near being a cause of war between the United States and Germany. At the critical moment a great storm dashed some of the war vessels on the rocks. Subsequently the sovereignty of the islands was pacifically divided between the two countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The next stop is at Levuka, in the Fiji Islands, 600 miles to the southwest of Apia. Fiji was once a place where the principal use the natives had for white men was to turn them into goulash, although they claimed that the flesh did not taste so well as the dark meat to which they were accustomed. Today Fiji with “ a population of 139,541 is one of the most thoroughly Christian countries in the world. We have two subscribers to The Golden Age in Fiji, and many indeed in our next place of call, New Zealand, 1,175 miles to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Australasia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE two islands that go to make up New</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zealand have an area of 105,000 square miles, or about the same as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware combined. The population is 1,008,468. The native New Zealanders are considered the finest primitive race in existence. They are tall, extremely well-built, often handsome, and of great native intelligence and vivacity. Since coming into contact with the Europeans the race has decreased at an alarming rate, due largely to imported diseases; and it is feared that the people may become extinct. New Zealand has one of the most progressive governments in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our next port of call is Hobart, on the island of Tasmania, 1,521 miles to the southwest of Auckland, New Zealand, and about as far southwest as one can go unless he wants to jump off into space. Tasmania is about a third the size of New Zealand, and lies south of the eastern shore of Australia. At this point we turn and go north. Tasmania and New Zealand are both equipped v^ith adequate railway systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sydney, Australia, 638 miles from Hobart, is our next stop. Australia deserves an article by itself, and will get one some time (D. V.) At present we merely notice that Australia has an area of 2,974,581 square miles as against 3,026,789 square miles for the United States. Unfortunately it is largely rainless; hence the population is as yet only 4,455,005. Its people are progressive, energetic, and are gradually sub</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pay to go thus far just </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to ride in a glass-bottomed</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> boat and study sea life. Besides, we might get homesick and abandon our trip to the Thousand Islands, toward which we are now getting well started. Vancouver Island, housing the beautiful city of Victoria, B. C., is a like distance away. We omit that, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So we turn west again, following the United States cable 1,149 miles, and stop at the Midway Islands. These are well named. They are 2,792 miles from S^n Francisco and 2,830 from Nagasaki, Japan. The nearest mainland is near Unalaska, 1,653 miles north. Unalaska itself is on an island, one of the volcanic Aleutian isles, off the coast of Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But we are westward bound, so we continue to follow the cable 2,301 miles from Midway to Guam. This island used to belong to Spain. It had no cable then. Along came an American warship and fired at the fort. The captain did not even know that there was a war, so he thought that he was being saluted and courteously fired a salute in return. When he found that he was really being fired at, he wisely hoisted a white flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We would like to stick to the cable, and go on 458 miles farther to the island of Yap, the only thing that Uncle Sam asked in return for the lives of 100,000 soldiers and $30,000,000,000 in treasure, hut the thing that he did not get. Japan wanted it and kept it. So, as Japan wants it and has it, we shall not yip a single yap about it, but will go straight north from Guam, 1,353 miles, to ruined Yokohama, in Japan itself. However, we are not going </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">stay. Japan is too big a subject; besides, we have already discussed it quite at length in our issues of February 16 and March 2, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Yokohama we go 1,585 miles southwest to Hongkong, passing on the left the large island of Formosa, which once belonged to China but which now belongs to Japan. From Formosa comes the world's camphor supply. The island of Hongkong is Britain's base for commerce with China. It was from Hongkong that Admiral Dewey sailed on his memorable trip to Manila, 631 miles south. We will follow his trail</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Philippines and East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE combined area of the Philippines is a little larger than New Zealand; the population is 8,368,247. When war was declared,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Admiral Dewey was ordered to leave Hongkong. Having nowhere else to go, he sailed into the fortified port of Manila during the night; and in the morning, before and after breakfast, he cleaned up the Spanish fleet and began work on the forts. As soon as he got ashore, he wisely cut the cables leading to Washington. He thus avoided receiving any orders as to what to do from politicians in Washington. The United States subsequently paid Spain $20,000,000 for the islands. Mr. Taft surrendered most of the best lands of the islands to the Roman Catholic Church, in a special bargain made directly with the Pope himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are in all 1,725 islands. The largest ten are Mindanao, Luzon, Samar, Negros, Panay, Palawan, Mindoro, Leyte, Cebu, and Bohol. The total area is 128,000 square miles, <sub>x </sub>twice that of New England and greater than that of the British Isles. The interiors of the larger islands rise to a height of from 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea LeveL There are some twenty active volcanoes. The rivers are numerous, swift and brimming with water. The largest are comparable to the Thames and the Connecticut. The islands are rich in birds. There are over 600 species, 325 of which are not known elsewhere. The principal food crop is* rice, but the amount raised is not enough for home use. Methods of cultivation are Spanish and exceedingly primitive. Handwork and wooden plows drawn by slow-going buffaloes are typical of the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The inhabitants are difficult to classify. There are half a hundred dialects. The Filipino works a little, and idles a great deal more. Small ricefields and poultry yards support the family. Cock-fighting is described as the principal pastime. The head of the family saunters about , with his fighting cock under his arm. When ha meets his neighbor, he squats down to discuss the points of the two birds as Westerners discuss their dogs or race horses, or as the Chinese discuss their kites. It is said that when his hut takes fire, as it is sure to do sooner or later, the Filipino saves his game-birds first and his children next</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Manila, the capital, is also the metropolis off the island. It has a population about equal to that of Washington, D. C. The styles of the houses, the bright paints used, the government buildings, the religious houses, the churches, and the cathedral give the city a distinctive Spanish appearance. As there is no national language, no tongue understood by all the people, English is taught in the schools and is the official language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Manila we go 1,559 miles southwest to Batavia, on the island of Java. Batavia, with a population of 138,551, is the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Next to Cuba, Java is the most fertile island in the world. Although it is only about the size of New York state it sustains a population of 30,098,008. Sumatra, to the northwest, over three times as large, has but one-eighth the population. Borneo, to the north, over five times as large, has less than one-fifteenth the population. Celebes, to the northwest, half again as large as Java (and shaped like a crooked letter K in a gale &lt;*f wind), has less than one-thirtieth of the population; while Papua or New Guinea, far to the east, and fourteen times as large, has a population about the same as Celebes, virtually all savages. These, with thousands of smaller islands, constitute the Dutch East Indies. The total area of these islands is nearly equal to one-third of the United States. The sovereignty of Borneo and Papua is divided between Holland and Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Batavia the course is westward to Colombo, Ceylon, a distance of 1,794 miles. Ceylon lies but a few miles north of the equator. It is about the size of the state of Maine, extremely fertile and has over four million inhabitants It is a great tea-producing country, also a stopping-place for every ship that passes through the Suez Canal enroute to the Far East It lies at the southern extremity of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our next stop is Mauritius, 2,098 miles to the southwest. If the Hawaiian Islands are the crossroads of the Pacific, then the isle of Mauritius is the crossroads of the Indian Ocean. It is a fertile isle, rather less than Rhode Island in size, with a population of 377,083 Although it is a British possesion, the education of the people is in the hands of the Roman Catholics. It is a large exporter of sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ales about Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UR next jump is a long one, taking us around the southern end of Africa and far out into the Atlantic Ocean. If we could afford it we would go straight ahead to the Falkland</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Islands, 6,493 miles. They lie five hundred miles east of the southern end of South America, and are the southernmost inhabited regions of the world. 2,272 hardy Scots manage to make a living there, raising sheep. The islands are as large as New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the way to the Falklands, about half way, in fact, if we were wrecked we could pull for the island of Tristan da Cunha, the only unbossed island in the world. These islanders, survivors from wrecked ships, have refused several offers of the British Government to move to more fertile lands. They dwell communally, without government .of any kind. What a terrible crime! It is almost against the law in the United States even to speak of such a thing, although it is the way primitive races in all lands have protected themselves from poverty from time </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">immem</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">orial There are not twenty-five dollars in currency on the islands. Crimes and disputes are rare. Big business should look into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">, and have it declared unconstitutional</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">However, it is too far to the Falklands; so we will head for St Helena instead, 4,001 miles from Mauritius. But whether we go to the Falklands or to St Helena we should not overlook the French islands of Reunion and Madagascar, both of which we could easily see on our way if the captain of the ship would accommodate us by steering just a little bit out of his course. Reunion is a small but fertile island with a population of 173,822, mostly Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. Madagascar is the one large island of Africa. It is about twice as large as Great Britain and Ireland, but somewhat smaller than Texas. No snow falls on the island. About 4,000 plants have been described, including species of palm, bamboo, tree fern, baobab, tamarind, orchis, and others, many of which are not found elsewhere. Over 125 birds not found elsewhere may be seen in the island. Postal service is maintained aU over the island, and is supplemented by 2,850 miles of telegraph lines and a cable to the mainland. The interior is believed to be rich in gold, copper, iron, lead, sulphur, and graphite. It is as yet unexplored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena is not a bad place. It has an area of forty-seven square miles and a population of 3,519. It is a fruit and lace-making center and has flourishing forests. Napoleon did not have such a bad place in which to spend his declining years. The devil Jakes care of his</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">own. See what a happy time that other butcher, the Kaiser, is having, while the world is in agony trying to pay the bill. Napoleon was born on an island, banished to another island, and died on a third island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We go on from St Helena 707 miles northwest to Ascension Island, which is the crossroads of the South Atlantic. The island is so small that it has only ten acres under cultivar tion, yet it is one of the pivots upon which British control of the seas depends. It is strongly fortified and central to every important development on the west coast of Africa or the east coast of South America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Southern European Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">G</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OING on 1,625 miles further to the northwest we come to St Vincent in the Cape Verde Islands, which lie about four hundred miles west of Africa, opposite the Sahara desert. They are the size of Delaware, have a population of 142,552, and are famous for the raising of medicinal herbs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From St. Vincent we go 1,042 miles north to ~ Funchal, Madeira Islands. On the way, a little off to the right, we pass the Canary Islands which, although they are seven hundred miles from Spain, are governed as though they were a part of the mainland. At Funchal we should like to turn to the right and go into the Mediterranean. If we did, we should find in that beautiful lake, two thousand miles long/many interesting isles: The Balearic Islands of Spain; Corsica, where Napoleon was «born; Elba, where he was banished; Sardinia, the largest island in the Mediterranean; Sicily, famed for its fertility, the size of Massachusetts and less than a mile £rom the toe of Italy; Malta, whence come Maltese kittens and the Maltese cross and where more different languages are in common use than in any other place under the sun; Corfu, just seized from Greece by Italy; Crete, of which St. Paul said some uncomplimentary things (Titus 1:12.); and Cyprus, the birthplace of the alphabet and the first point visited by St. Paul as a missionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But in our search for the Thousand Islands we are sticking to the high seas; so instead of turning to the right at Funchal we turn to the left and go seven hundred miles northwest to Favai, in the Azores, which comes nearer to being the crossroads of the North Atlantic than any other point The Azores are 1,100 miles from Gibraltar, and 1,200 miles from St Johns* Newfoundland. Like the Cape Verde and Madeira Islands they belong to Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Northern European Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tp ROM the Azores we go 2,168 miles northeast to Copenhagen, Denmark. Though Denmark itself is not an island, yet its capital is on an island between the mainland of Europe and the Swedish peninsula. On the way we pass on our right the rich Channel Islands, Jersey, Alderney, and Guernsey, famous for the fine dairy cattle bearing their names. The islands lie ten to twenty miles off the French coast, and eighty to a hundred miles off the British coast. Though they have a total area of only seventy-five square miles, they pay annually into the British treasury the sizable sum of £600,000, which is a considerable sum to pay for the privilege of being governed by somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the way to Copenhagen we pass on our left the richest, most famous isles in the world, described at some length in our recent articles entitled &quot;Impressions of Britain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From Copenhagen we could go north about three thousand miles to Spitsbergen, &quot;The Land of the Midnight Sun,” and see the coal deposits which have been<sub>v</sub>discovered there; also the place where Amundsen was supposed to alight in his airplane, after his flight across the North Pole. But as he did not take the flight, we will leave it off from our itinerary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Northwestward from Copenhagen 1,250 miles brings us to Iceland. On the way we pass on the right the Shetland Islands, whence come our neat little Shetland ponies. On the left are the <sup>5 </sup>Hebrides (we have subscribers there, too), on one of which is a mountain 1,600 feet high, said to be ninety-nine percent pure sulphur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Although Iceland touches the arctic circle, it has a climate far milder than would be ex* pected. The air is so clear that mountains * hundred miles away can be plainly seen. One policeman maintains order among the 85,00$ inhabitants on the island. But he has nothing to do; for there are no saloons, no jails, no illiteracy. If an Iceland girl wears her braid over one shoulder, she is married; if over the other, she is single. The standard of education is unusually higU</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">K </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">North American Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">K Tp BOM Iceland we sail 1,670 miles in a south--T westerly direction to St Johns, Newfound-land. Newfoundland is about the size of the s : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state of Pennsylvania. To the right we pass</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greenland which, with other great isles to the s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west of it, is almost as large as the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">States. Upemavik, on the western coast of '.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenland, is the most northerly inhabited vil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">lage in the world. The western coast is warmer than the eastern, as a warm ocean current runs up the western side while a cold current follows the eastern shore southward. The interior of Greenland is one of the coldest spots known, being some twenty degrees colder than the Arctic Ocean. The height of Petermann Mountain, on the eastern shore, is estimated at 11,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Thousand Islands lie grouped in the St. Lawrence river, near Lake Ontario. If we wanted to do so, we could go most of the way from Newfoundland to the Thousand Islands by rail. There would be a railway journey on J <sup>;</sup> Newfoundland itself of 546 miles and then a steamer journey of 104 miles to Cape Breton - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island, the northern portion of Nova Scotia,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">after which all the rest of the journey would be by rail. On the way we would pass, on our right, the fertile and thickly settled Prince Edwards Island, lying in the Gulf of St Lawrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But we have other plans. Again we take to the open sea, and this time we are on the home stretch. Our journey is to a point 1,200 miles to the southwest. On the way we pass the state of Maine. A list of the islands off its coast would </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> far toward filling The Golden Age from cover to cover. The famous summer resort, Bar Harbor, is on one of these isles. In the harbor of Portland are scores, possibly hundreds, of beautiful homes, each on its own , little islet in Casco Bay. We also pass the &gt;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summer resort islets of Nantucket and Martha’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Vineyard, w’hich lie off the coast of Massa-<sup>f</sup> chusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As we near our destination we observe Long Island, shaped like a fish, 118 miles long, with Brooklyn as the head. We go up to the head ' of the fish. On our left is the beautiful residential Staten Island, fourteen miles long by five miles wide. It is reached by boats which ply back and forth, one leaving every ten </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-' utes. It takes a half hour to make the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Valuable Island of Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T LAST we reach the port of disembarca-tion. It is Manhattan Island, the most valuable piece of real estate in the world. About three miles wide and fifteen miles long, it houses the heart of the city of New York It was bought from the Indians for $24. Modern financiers would surely have found a way to save those $24. They would probably have given the Indians a bogus check for the amount. Did not one of the great banks get the Customs House on Wall Street, worth millions of dollars, away from the United States Government merely by bookkeeping operations, without its ever having cost the bank a red cent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Finally! Our Destination</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E PROCEED to the New York Central station. We are in time to catch the 9:00 p. m. train. It has a sleeping-car attached which takes us to Clayton, N. Y., 345 miles, in time for an early breakfast the next morning. * Here we are at the Thousand Islands in the St Lawrence River. There are 1,500 of them, and upon these beauty spots are some of the loveliest summer homes on earth. It has been quite a trip, some 42,864 miles by water, not counting the side trips. But it has been worth while; for we have seen all the most important islands on the globe besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some day all the islands of the world will be beauty spots, as beautiful as the Thousand Islands are now. Perhaps there are readers of The Golden Age that will yet visit all^the j islands mentioned in this article, possibly fol-lowing the route we have outlined. When the time has come that men will not need to die, and when they know that they will have all eternity before them, what pleasure the inhabitants of this world will have in sailing its seas and really getting acquainted with their inheritance! The average distance apart of the island . <sup>? </sup>groups to which we have called attention u 1,428 miles, which is plenty far enough for an interesting trip even if the islanders wish to * visit only their near neighbors. It is good to know that there is plenty of water. It helps to comfort those who fear that in some unexplainable way the literal sand and gravel and rocks -will yet take fire. There will be plenty of water u? to put it out. Also, there is plenty of water to make the earth a paradise; for water is all that is needed on its desert lands.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS profitable to trace the handwriting of divine inspiration in the unfolding of the promises given in the Old and New Testaments concerning the mission and ministry of Jesus Christ, the Savior, Over four thousand years of history were involved in the working out of preparations for the coming of Messiah. Almost twenty centuries have transpired since </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hi a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> coming, during which time opportunity has been given to apply the teaching of the gospel to men and nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One naturally would expect that after six thousand years there would be found in all parts of the world righteousness, peace, prosperity, and blessing; and yet there never has been a time when these elements have been lacking so mueh, and when there have been so much strife, violence, suffering and warfare as are found among the nations today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We may well cry out with Isaiah the prophet as we look at the conditions facing us on every hand: “Watchman, what of the night! .. . The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night; if ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, come.’’—Isaiah 21:1,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Egyptian darkness, long ago, settled over the whole earth, but in the hearts and dwellings of God’s people the light is ever shining. The morning of the Golden Age, when there shall be a re-writing of history, has arrived; the promise is, that at evening time there shall be light. So, the thing to be expected is intellectual illumination by true knowledge and wisdom as man’s near-coming heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Came of Humanity<sup>9</sup>* Failure</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE cause of the world-wide failure of humanity’s development in righteousness, in economic enterprise, and in government, is sin. Though sin in the beginning manifested itself in only one act of disobedience, it was clear in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d of God that that one act would spell disaster, failure, for the entire race, resulting in its condemnation; and that unless some provision for the redemption of man was made it would be utterly impossible to establish the rule of God in the hearts of men upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Having foreseen clearly the “fall” of man as the result of the first temptation, God had al- -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">light”—Zechariah 14:7.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a,./</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ready made provision in His eternal counsel for t the promised “seed of the woman” to take up the warfare against the serpent, in due time to eradicate every trace of sin and suffering from * humanity and to restore fully the image of God as it was manifested in the first human pair / before sin marred the grandeur of that likeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When chaos is the order of the day in the <sup>1 </sup>commercial, social, political and religious world, the trusting child of God goes to the Scriptures and finds therein a definite plan and program, which in spite of, and in the very midst of, the present demoralized conditions, is working out ' the definite plan for the incoming of the glorious kingdom of the Messiah which shall prevail <sup>? </sup>for a thousand years, bringing peace, happiness and life to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What a joy, what a blessed privilege, what ’ an inspiration, to be able to turn to the sacred t pages of Holy Writ and there see written by God’s holy prophets, thousands of years ago, the very things which are taking place today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The world sees nothing but utter darkness <sup>v 7 </sup>ahead; but God’s people see the light coming; they see 'the Sun of Righteousness arising with healing in His wings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So we look at the compass of God’s Word and there find the proper directions for our faith, while the clouds hang dark and low, and <sup>1</sup> \ the billows of sorrow and trouble roll high.— 2 Peter 1:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Human History in Brief</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE history of the human race as portrayed in the Bible, from the book of Genesis to that of Revelation, covers a period of seven thousand years. It is well for every one to &quot;&nbsp;j have some dear conception of the wonderful panorama portrayed before us of the happen- „ ings of men and nations during the unfolding ' <sup>1 </sup>of the ages that are past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Six thousand years of the world’s history lie in the past This period of time is divided up into ages or dispensations. Sin entered the world through the disobedience of our first par- <sup>k </sup>ents, as a result of the lying suggestion ol; Lucifer, who there became Satan, an adversary* &quot;&nbsp;or enemy of both God and man. Lucifer, mean- ? ing bright shining one, had been placed in the <sup>1 </sup>Garden of Eden as guardian, as indicated in</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“the anointed cherub that covereth.” (Ezekiel 28:14) Hearing the command given to Adam, •Multiply and fill the earth and have dominion over it/ pride and disloyalty entered his heart (Ezekiel 28:15), and he determined to alienate 'Adam and Eve from their Creator that they should become his subjects. “I will be like the Most High”; I will have a dominion of my own, was his ambitious thought. He pictured to himself the whole earth filled with Adam's posterity, and himself as their king.—Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:13-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to gratify his ambition to have a dominion of his own he lied to mother Eve. She believed Satan's lie and disobeyed God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some time after expulsion from Eden God permitted the angels to try to recover the fallen and dying race. The apostle Paul refers to these in Hebrews 2:5, speaking of the world to come: “For unto the angels hath he not put into subjection the world to come.” He had in mind their utter failure in their attempt to recover the race in the first “world”—the antediluvian period. These angels are also referred to4&gt;y Jude as “the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation” (vs. 6); also by Peter.—2 Peter 2:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Human history in the antediluvian age spans 1,656 years, and was characterized by wickedness and violence which made it necessary for God to bring about a great deluge to put an end to the corruption of that time.—Genesis 6:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“IM </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Present Evil World”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">glory, and the establishment of His kingdom on earth, for which He told His disciples to pray, “Thy kingdom come,” is the great period termed by the apostle Paul, “this present evil world” (Galatians 1:4), not because there is no good in it, but because evil predominates. In 606 B. C., when Bang Zedekiah, the last king of Israel, was dethroned and taken into captivity by the king of Babylon, Satan became the &quot;god of this world.” (2 Corinthians 4:4) He had been the “god” of the heathen nations before that time, but now he was permitted to usurp universal sway. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“This present evil world” is divided into three .different ages: First, the Patriarchal age in which God dealt only with the patriarchs Noah, Abraham, Job and others. It was during this age that the promise was given to Abraham that through his “seed” all the families of the earth were to be blessed.—Genesis 12:2,3; Galatians 3:16,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It was also during this period that various nations of antiquity arose, such as Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, with their learning, arts, commerce, and priestcraft. World-wide paganism resulted so that it became expedient for God to call into existence a new nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Chosen People</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T THE death of Jaeob, God called into existence the nation of Israel, who remained under Egyptian bondage for centuries, until delivered by God from their oppression by the hand of Moses. After their deliverance they were given the divine Decalogue, written upon tables of stone. Statutes and judgments were given them to make of them a mighty nation. (Exodus 19:5,6) After forty years'wandering in the wilderness they entered the promised land of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua. For 450 years God gave them judges, who were to judge and did judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger (foreigner) that was with him.—Dent 1:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But, as illustrated in all surrounding nations, Israel became infatuated with the popular idee of having a king to rule over them with the accompanying pomp and splendor. God was indulgent to their whims and gave them kings, knowing these would be unable to accomplish the great things hoped for. Under some of these kings Israel fell into idolatry, setting up groves and images in the land. God sent them prophets whose prophecies were generally repugnant to the degenerating and time-serving priesthood, and to the idolatrously-inclined people. But the promise of a personal Messiah was made, who should be of the lineage of David—a great King far superior to the great, wise and rich Solomon.</span></p>

From 606 B. C. four universal empires have held sway; namely, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. King Nebuchadnezzar's dream, interpreted, was a .vision of the “kingdoms of this world” under Gentile dominion, finally to be broken in pieces by a kingdom which the God of heaven would set up. —Daniel 2:3145.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Daniel's dream, recorded in the seventh chapter, portrays the same Gentile nations from the divine standpoint in their true character aS ferocious beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The entire period of “Gentile times&quot; is characterized in prophecy by pride, vanity, brutality, revolution, warfare and conquest. The Gentile times ended in 1914, their lease of power having expired; and we are now witnessing the breaking process going on, as illustrated by the “stone cut out of the mountain without hands” (not of human but of divine origin), smiting the image on the “feet,&quot; as represented by the disintegration of the nations of Europe since 1914.—Daniel 2:44,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What a blessed privilege to be living at this time—witnessing the overthrow of Satan's empire as represented in the kingdoms of earth, preparatory to the establishment of Christ's kingdom in their stead!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Messiah Came in Due Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T WAS during the zenith of Roman power that Jesus the long-promised Messiah was sent of God to provide redemption in Israel. He came to His own people; but, as had been foretold, His own received Him not. The scribes and Pharisees, the religionists of His day who had become the tools of Satan, persecuted Him because He exposed their hypocrisy, and finally had Him put to death. But as had been foretold by the Hebrew prophets He must needs die in order to redeem not only Israel but the whole world. (Isaiah 53:1-12) Forty years later the terrible massacre of the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem under the Roman general, Titus, ended the Jewish polity; and they were taken as slaves into all parts of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Bbooklyv. X. %</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman Empire. Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled.—Luke 21:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The death of Jesus, however, did not leave God without witnesses in the earth. The apostles under the guidance of the holy spirit descending upon them at Pentecost preached the coming kingdom; and for nineteen centuries God has been selecting His church, first from the Jews and then from among the Gentiles—“a people for his name.&quot;—Acts 15:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But as the apostle Paul had foretold, after his departure grievous wolves entered the flock. (Acts 20:29,30) After the apostles fell asleep the work of converting the world by great show and ceremony was undertaken about the year 325 A. D., when the bishops of the church proclaimed themselves the successors to the apostles in power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Emperor Constantine, who for political purposes made the Christian religion that of the state, invited the bishops, who were quarreling amongst themselves, to the city of Nice, not far from Constantinople; and there at the Council of Nice was formulated the first creed, called the Nicene Creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There began Satan's masterpiece, the counterfeit kingdom of Christ on earth—“Christendom,&quot; so-called; and for more than twelve centuries creed after creed was brought forth and anybody found in possession of a Bible was suspected of heresy and liable to persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heathen teachings and Greek philosophies were introduced into the Christian faith by the thousands of heathen who flocked into the Christian churches. As the heathen believed that most of their gods were cruel monsters, and worshiped them because they feared them, in order to increase their influence the bishop* and clergy invented the blasphemous, God-dishonoring doctrine of eternal torment of all those who did not join the “church&quot; and subscribe to the creeds. Thousands of heathens flocked into the church and were baptized by being sprinkled </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> with branches dipped into water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the heathen, who were accustomed to many gods, the worship of only the one true God Jehovah implied a scarcity of gods. So the doctrine of the “trinity&quot; was introduced—three Gods in one God; one«God in three Gods; yet not three Gods, but only one God! This was a masterpiece of theology, and no doubt the bishops congratulated themselves on their marvelous wisdom(!)J The word &quot;trinity” is not found in the Bible; neither is the doctrine taught therein.—1 Corinthians 8:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By her false doctrines mystic Babylon has made the nations drunk.—Revelation 17:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reformation and Searching for Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE sixteenth century a bold attempt for liberty was made in what is known as the Reformation. The people began to demand the Bible. Tyndale translated the New Testament into English between the years 1523 and 1525. After it was smuggled into England in 1526 the bishops of the Church of England, fearing that the creeds would be challenged by Bible authority, bought up Tyndale’s New Testaments and publicly burned them in front of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. But the time had come for the Bible, which had been clothed in &quot;sackcloth,” to be liberated to the people; and the people’s increasing demand for the Bible led the bishops to publish what is known as the &quot;Bishops’ Bible.” Various translations have since been published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan sought to hinder the increasing light by fostering among the people the spirit of sectarianism, which has increased the confusion of doctrines until today the vast majority of those who profess to be Christian are completely perplexed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">End of Satan<sup>9</sup>e Empire Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ODAY we are living in the closing days of Satan's empire and witnessing the overthrow of a condition of things which has • caused superstition, darkness, hatred and warfare for many centuries. We are also witnessing increasing light, not only on the Bible but on every avenue of human progress and development. Witness the wonderful inventions of our day about which our forefathers knew nothing. &quot;The day of his preparation” (Nahum 2:3, 4) is getting the world ready for the glorious kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ—the Golden Age, sung by poets and foretold by prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Today we are living at the end of the age, the Gospel age, which Jesus and the prophet Daniel said would close with a great time of trouble. (Matthew 24:21,22; Daniel 12:1-4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The increase of knowledge and labor-saving machinery without the corresponding development of brotherly love is bringing on the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We are living in the transition period, between the &quot;present evil world” and the‘&quot;world * to come wherein dwelleth righteousness.” And as Noah and his family were carried over from one world into another, so there are now millions of people living who will be carried over into that world to come, Christ’s kingdom, without experiencing death. Hence, “millions now living will never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Two thousand years ago Jesus gave himself as the great ransom-sacrifice, in order that we might have life and have it more abundantly. Under His millennial kingdom He will give life to all the willing and obedient. During the thousand years of His righteous kingdom the curse of sin and death will be rolled away; and instead of sighing and crying, sorrow and death, there will be joy, peace, prosperity and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Retrospective and Pnspectiue</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HUS we have seen that for the past six thousand years under the curse of sin and death it has been a &quot;dark night” indeed, long to be remembered; but as promised at &quot;evening time” the light shall fully have come; and some are now able to penetrate the dark clouds that still hang low and to see the increasing light ‘ beyond, the light that shall increase even unto the perfect day. What a prospect lies before us as we contemplate the complete restitution of the human race into the moral image of our Creator, and also foresee the earth restored and made a fit abode for such beings I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The world has waited long for that glorious day of emancipation from the thraldom of Sin and Death. Well may we rejoice and give glory to God that that day has arrived—when the promised &quot;seed of th© woman,” the glorified church, shall crush the serpent’s head and liberate from under his sway the groaning creation! We can now intelligently pray: &quot;Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;His name shall endure for ever; his name shall be continued as long as the sun; and men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed,”—Psalm 72:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">XA7E HAVE received many kind letters regarding &quot;Impressions of Britain” which appeared in ten installments in The Golden Age last winter. One of these letters follows, a sample of many: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jamaica, B. W. I., June 1, 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Me. Editor: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I feel constrained to send you a few words of commendation for the very excellent articles contributed to the readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> under the caption of &quot;Impressions of Britain.” I cannot express the amount of benefit I have received from them—not only of information and inspiration, but of real enjoyment of your consecrated wit and humor, so stimulating under the present stress and struggle for existence!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I might mention, too, that I am now experimenting upon a hygienic suggestion in one of those articles that seems likely to prove of the greatest benefit to me that I have ever derived from any previous knowledge on that matter, which I refrain from explaining now, as I hope to be able to more amply testify later to you and others. In the meantime I hasten to suggest, if indeed I am not already late, that you publish those articles in booklet form for the benefit of the younger generation; for it seems to me that nothing has-ever yet been written to meet the demand for up-to-date information concerning Britain and the really great British people as those articles do. And what is most interesting to me on this point is: The two most faithful and generous descriptions, that I have read, of the moral and social excellence of the British people over all other nations, written so far apart in point of time,. are both by real Americans—Ralph Waldo Emerson, and yourself—who made similar tours throughout the British Isles! See Emerson’s &quot;Representative Men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I heg your acceptance of this humble tribute, and believe me</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Yours very sincerely, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jno. Hickling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We wonder how many of our subscribers would care for such a book as Mr. Hickling has described. The book would be of large print, well bound, liberally illustrated with the choicest English scenes, and carefully edited so as to be a credit to any library. How many copies of such a book could you use at a dollar apiece, postpaid to any part, of the world! Suppose you drop a personal not^ to the editor, and the matter will be given consideration. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do not send any money</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> until the decision is made whether or not to publish.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>The Doodle Bug</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rpEXAS has the doodle-bug. Its size is that of a small lady-bug, but it has a longer neck; its color is that of the dust in which it thrives; and its body is soft and tough. The chief occupation of this bug is to make funnelshaped holes in the sandy earth in size from one to three inches in diameter at the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The doodle-bug crawls backward in a circle, burying its body in the dust and sand; and with its head it throws out with a sharp jerk the shower of earth that falls over its body until the funnel has come to a point at the bottom. Then it begins again at the top, and works down increasing the size of its funnel until it can no longer throw the dust out of the depth. No one seems to know what is the bug's object in making these funnels. It works mostly, if not entirely, in the shade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Children derive much amusement in locating the bug; for even when seen in operation it is difficult to find, because its color is exactly that of the dirt wherein it works. Often the ground is dotted thickly with the funnel-shaped holes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our statement is true as far as our knowledge goes; but we have been informed that &quot;the longest straight stretch of railway line in the world is in Australia.” This line is across the Nullarbor Plain, and is roughly' estimated at 300 miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-*</span></p>

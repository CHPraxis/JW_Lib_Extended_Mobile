<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now belnff presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., Teibi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dei Minister</span><span class="font4"> (V, D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s 'Word.</span><span class="font4"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated -—redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font4"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : G) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills ; 2 Peter 1: 5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which . . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3 : 5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; tor we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to w’hat may and what may not appear in its columns </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font4"> be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 :16, 17; Ephesians 2 : 20-22; Genesis 28 :14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font4">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which Kghteth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font4"> “in due time”.—-Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be ‘ partaker of the divine nature,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:37; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 241 14 ; Revelation 1: 6 ; 20 : 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, ths restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church* when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font4">Acts 3: 19-23 ; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The colored friends of the International Bible Students Association will have their general convention in New York city August 31 to September 3, inclusive.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the consecrated brethren in order to earn the necessities of this life are employed in offices, shops, etc., and a certain period is granted each year for vacation or holidays. The vacation season is near. These vacation periods are usually from two to three weeks. Some of the friends thus situated have signified their desire to spend their vacation period in the colporteur work and have asked if this can be arranged. It can be arranged, and we think it is a splendid idea. We believe many of the friends will wish to do likewise when they find there is a special inducement and opportunity. For this reason the Society is offering such opportunity and inducement and all who desire to spend their vacation in the colporteur work may arrange to do so. Territory suitable to your convenience may be assigned and the books will be sent to you at a special price, provided you signify that you are spending your vacation in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact is that a real vacation consists in a change of environment and of work. No one really wants to be idle, and this is particularly true of the consecrated. The colporteur work will furnish a real recreation from office work and at the same time will enable each to pay expenses. We believe that many of the friends are glad to avail themselves of this opportunity. If you are one, please write to the Society at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, stating that you wish to spend your vacation in the colporteur work and ask to be registered in the Society’s list of special colporteurs for that season. State the time of your vacation and what territory you would prefer. The Society will be glad to cooperate with you. Besides furnishing a really joyful recreation, it will be a splendid opportunity to advertise the King and the kingdom. We believe all such will be both physically and spiritually refreshed and will go back to their respective posts of duty better equipped to perform their secular labors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you contemplate taking advantage of this offer, write quickly, stating where you wish your books shipped, so that we can have them there ready for you when your vacation begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">convention at Tacoma, Washington, for six days will begin August 14, ending August 19. A nine-day convention, beginning August 18 and ending August 26, will be held at Los Angeles. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">special train will be run from Chicago. Round trip fare, $104.00. Add to this sleeper and all meals on train for the entire trip, $114.00 more. Full details will be published in the next issue of The Watch Tower.

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A CLEAR VISION OF CHRONOLOGY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">F FULL </span><span class="font6">understanding </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">all the details of chronology had been necessary to victory in the race for the high calling, it would have been supplied all down through </span><span class="font7">the Gospel age. </span><span class="font6">After the apostles fell asleep chronology was little noticed until about “the time of the end.” As the time drew near for the setting up of the kingdom, God began to arouse some of his servants to the time-features </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">his plan, that the church might not be in darkness, as stated by the Apostle.—1 Thessalonians 5 : 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup>We have often noticed travelers who paid little attention </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font6">their time-tables until nearing their destination; then they began to scan the schedules closely to see whether their trains were on time. Their knowledge, or lack of it, would not affect the arrival of the train, but would have considerable to do with their preparations. So with </span><span class="font7">God’s </span><span class="font6">consecrated people as they near their destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Aside from the Bible record the history of the human race in its infancy is very uncertain. Family history passed from father to son by word of mouth for centuries. The rising generations were more or less migratory; and, as families became more numerous and daily affairs were more pressing, it was easy to lose interest in the past and to throw about it the halo of tradition. Occasionally kings desired to have their exploits recorded that future generations might know of their greatness; thus records of the reigning families were kept, and stored in the palaces of the kings. Wars were frequent; and the victor usually cared little or nothing for the history of the vanquished, and if it were preserved, it might be altered that the importance of the victor should appear the greater. This continued more or less until about 600 to 800 years before Christ. Then secular history began to come more Into vogue, but was not very popular or reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup>The record of the Jews is a no.able exception. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">pro\ided them xvitli a &lt;•&lt;&gt;.,.p.ele connected bistort t'o i the creation of the first man to their exodus from Egypt. This, together with their own carelully kept records to iroiect the line of succession of their priesthood and kings, continues until their return from the Babylonian captivity, 3592 A. M. At that date secular history becomes reliable, and from then on Jewish history is disconnected. This of Itself is remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup>The problem of the historians has been to connect properly the historical events during and prior to the Babylonian captivity. The history of the Jews runs parallel with that of the Babylonians for nearly ninety years, and they touch at many points. The Bible records of this period make frequent mention of Babylonian kings, and incidentally throw considerable light upon that nation. It is for this reason that historians generally endeavor to carry the chronological line through the Babylonian and Jewish records. One date of connection is very generally agreed upon ; but, not properly reading some of the Jewish prophecies </span><span class="font7">and the records </span><span class="font6">of their fulfilment, </span><span class="font7">by endeavoring to </span><span class="font6">connect up other dates chronologers differ considerably. They generally miss the correct dates by about eighteen or nineteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup>There need lie no difficulty, however, if the Bible records are followed carefully. That all may easily see that we have been correct in the dates given in the Scripture Studies and The Watch Tower, we herewith present an outline chart, showing the harmony of the references in the Scripture, and giving explanations of apparent difficulties. By it may be located the time when many of the prophetic visions were given, especially those in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup>Those who have relied too much upon secular history have become confused, and begin to entertain doubts about the Bible record, which is the only “sure foundation” for God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">^Chronology itself is not a vital doctrine, necessary to salvation : but it is closely related to the doctrines, and gives great aid &gt;o a proper understanding of God's Word at this time. Let all who are interested give it a careful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup>The points of difference by historians lie chiefly between the dates of 536 B. C. and 630 B. C. The connected Bible history ends with the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel at the close of the seventy years of “desolation of the land,” usually termed the seventy years of captivity. Tins was 3592 years from the creation of Adam, and was “the first year of Cyrus king of Persia.” This “first year of Cyrus” is very generally accepted as 53G B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1O</sup>A11 admit that if the last year of the seventy was 536 </span><span class="font7">B. C. </span><span class="font6">the first year must have been 606 B. </span><span class="font7">C. </span><span class="font6">With what event in Jewish history did the seventy years begin? It should </span><span class="font7">be </span><span class="font6">noted that the chronological line, as recorded in the Bible, is given by faithful, holy men, chosen by God as his special servants; and that therefore it is reliable; wicked, faithless men and heathen nations are referred to only incidentally, as they come in contact with God's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That all may compare some of the “conclusions” of secular historians we quote from “McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s Cyclopedia”: “Nebuchadnezzar pressed forward and had reached Egypt, when news of his father’s death recalled him; and hastily returning to Babylon, he was fortunate enough to find himself, without any struggle, acknowledged king, B. C. 604.” The list of Babylonian kings is given as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nabopolassar ................................625 to 604 B. C. 21 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar, his son............604 to 561 B. C. 43 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Uloarudamus, his son</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Evil-Merodach) __________ 561 to </span><span class="font7">559 B. C. &nbsp;2 </span><span class="font6">years</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nerigassolassarus ----------- 559 to 555 B. C. &nbsp;4 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nabonadius (jointly with his</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">son Belshazzar) ........ 555 to 538 B. C. 17 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This reaches down to 538 B. C., </span><span class="font6">when Darius and </span><span class="font7">Cyrus, at the head of the Medes and Persians, took </span><span class="font6">Babylon; </span><span class="font7">when</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the second world empire arose. Two years later Cyrus became sole ruler, 536 15. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup>The above list states that Nebuchadnezzar did not become king until 604 15. C. The united testimony of 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel is that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon when the seventy-year period of Jewish captivity began. This is acknowledged to be GOG 15. C. To bridge this difficulty, it is “assumed” that he reigned jointly “with his father” for two years. From the statement in Jeremiah 2.4 : 1-3 that “the fourth year of Jehoiakim . . . was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” it is furl her “assumed” that the fourth year of Jehoiakim most there.ore be the first year of the captivity, and therefore 6&lt;r&gt; B. C. That being “settled,” all other dates are made to harmonize therewith. They “conclude” that Nebuchadnezzar was considered as king, though reigning with Ids father from GOG to 604 15. C. This shows the method of arriving at the dates given in the margin of some of the Oxford Bibles, which follow the chronology of Bishop Usher. Note marginal references opposite Jeremiah 25: 1 and 11. This throws the reckoning off at least eighteen years. See marginal reference opposite 2 Chronicles 36: 19. There is no need of following this further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup>We now note the clearness of the Scriptural records. Jeremiah 25:1 reads: “The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fourth</span><span class="font6"> year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font6"> year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” Nothing in that verse intimates where Nebuchadnezzar was at the time Jeremiah had this word from the Lord. The Prophet simply gave the date when he received it, the twenty-third year of his prophecy (v. 3), by referring to two kings, one of Judah and one of Babylon. In verses 9 to 12 he prophesies that God WILL BRING Nebuchadnezzar against the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">land,</span><span class="font6"> and that the children of Israel WILL BE TAKEN to Babylon for a period of seventy years, during which time there would be a complete desolation of the land. This was fulfilled nineteen years later, commencing in G06 B. C. The captivity recorded in 2 Kings 24:8-16 took place when Jehoiachin had begun his reign (vs. 6, 8) in 617 B. C., at which time the land was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font6"> made desolate (v. 14). These two events should not be confused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup>God knew that his children today, at this testing time, when all manner of deceptions would abound to “deceive if possible the very cleet,” would need a “thus saith the Lord” as a sure foundation. He therefore overruled that his servants the prophets should include in their writings all the information necessary to form a complete connected line from Adam to the time when secular history became reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup>Those who follow the evidence herewith presented will see tiie accuracy and simplicity of the record. We give many citations, also quotations from corroborative records in harmony therewith. The latter are not necessary, for the Bible record is complete in itself; but these additional testimonies often include interesting details not found elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup>God told Daniel that he did not purpose that “the wicked” should understand. His information was only for the “wise,” those willing to look to God. These wise ones are willing to begin at the beginning with confidence that God will supply his own with all that is needed; for the “fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>ls</sup>God's servants of old wrote at different times and under greatly varying circumstances: therefore we should not expect to find all tiie data assembled in one place, but “here a little, there a little.&quot; Occasionally references were made to events with which many at the time of the writing were familiar, and details were not necessary. As time passed, tiie details would </span><span class="font7">become </span><span class="font6">obscured; and only the slight references found in the records remained. Again, if God had designed that the wicked should not understand, we can see another reason for scattering the links, to be readily found when really needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup>No attempt is here made to enter into details of days or months of the beginning or ending of the reigns of the various kings. Jeboahnz and Jehoiachin each reigned three months, but in tiie Bible records these are absorbed in the reigns of predecessor or successor. This is proved by the overlapping periods mentioned m order Scripture references, as will appear later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EXPLANATION OF TIIE CHART</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup>The spaces between the light vertical lines represent one year each. It begins with the thirteenth year of Josiah, 646 B. C., as that was the year in wliicli Jeremiah began his work as a prophet; and Jeremiah figured prominently during much of the period under discussion. It closes with the third year of C\ rus, tiie date of Daniel’s last recorded vision. Bible references to dates following that year are not directly connected with preceding events, hence cannot be used. The lower line of figures represent dates known as Before Christ, usually written with B. C. and read from right to left, because reading backward from the date of Christ’s birth. The small letters above this line refer to notes which are given in this explanation. They are placed at the dates in which the events referred to in the references or quotations took place. Space is too limited to write them all down on the chart. By reference to the citations, notes and quotations it will be readily seen which dates synchronize and thus form a harmonious whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup>There is but one event connected with and located in both Jewish and secular history that can be definitely dated in each. This is- the “first year of Cyrus king of Persia.” The Bible date is 3592 A. M., and the secular date is 536 B. C. This fact should not be overlooked, and was evidently arranged by Jehovah that the man of God might be fully convinced. More connections are not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup>A11 dates prior to 53G B. C. should be built upon the Bible record. Secular history is no standard by which to correct supposed errors in the Bible. Starting, therefore, with “the first year of Cyrus” as 536 B. C., we see the seventy years of “desolation of the land” must have begun seventy years prior, or 606 B. C. With what event in Jewish history did the land become desolate? Leviticus 26:34, 35 reads: “Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">long as it Heth desolate,</span><span class="font6"> AND </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ye be in your enemies’ land</span><span class="font6"> [note that the two conditions must synchronize—the inhabitants would be captives and the land desolate] ; even </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font6"> shall the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">land</span><span class="font6"> rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">long as it Heth </span><span class="font6">DESOLATE it shall rest; BECAUSE </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dtvclt upon it.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> This was a prophecy. Jeremiah 25: 11,12 reads: “And </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this whole land</span><span class="font6"> shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. And it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished—.” Here the length of time is given, as also in Jeremiah 2!): 10. 2 Chronicles 36: 19-21 explains further. After describing the complete destruction of the temple, the city of Jerusalem and the captivity of all the people this record says: “To fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> Surely this is simple enough. The land must </span><span class="font7">be </span><span class="font6">desolate for seventy years to keep her sabbaths; at the same time the people of Israel must be captives in an enemy’s land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup>Jeremiah 52:12-15 states that these conditions </span><span class="font7">com</span><span class="font6">menced in the nineteenth </span><span class="font7">year of </span><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">In his first year. 2 Kings 25:2-8 definitely connpets ihe nineteenth year of N. bu.'ii.'dncz..ar with the eleventh year of Zedekitli. The overthrow of Jerusalem in the eleventh year of Zedekiah. and the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, must be tlie event which marked the beginning of the seventy years’ desolation, or 606 15. C. From this it is easy to figure the date of any of the kings. Zedekiah had reigned eleven years. His reign must have begun eleven years prior to GOG 15. C., or 617 B. C. Jehoiakim reigned for eleven years; thus his reign began 628 B. C. Josiah reigned thirty-one years, beginning 659 B. C.; and so on as tar back as one cares to go. Jehoiachin was dethroned, and many of the Jews were taken captive in 617; but as long as there were people in the land and the city of Jerusalem was inhabited and the sacrifices at the temple continued, the land could not be said to be “without an inhabitant,” and keeping her sabbaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup>There are some passages of Scripture which at casual reading seem to be out of exact harmony: but a little investigation clears the apparent discrepancy. Jeremiah 52: 28,29 mentions some events ns taking place in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">seventh </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ciyhteenth</span><span class="font6"> years of Nebuchadnezzar; whereas 2 Kings 24:12 and Jeremiah 52:12 mention the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">eiyhth</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nineteenth</span><span class="font6"> years as the dates tor the same events. Any careful reader can easily see that the last seven verses of Jeremiah must have been added by some later writer. (Note Jeremiah’s own statement in 32:1.) Ezra is usually credited with this addendum, as he is also credited with the compiling of the records of the Chronicles. Ezra was born and reared in Babylon, but did not return to Jerusalem until the seventh year of Artaxerxes, some sixty-nine years after 536 B. C. (Ezra 7:7,8) Being an educated scribe, he might easily have adopted one of the Assyrian dates. Babylon belonged to Assyria at that time. The following quotation from “The Assyrian Canon,” by George Smith, will be interesting here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup>“Among the Assyrians the regnal years of the kings were not reckoned from the day o<sup>;</sup> accession, but from the Assyrian’s New Year's day either before or after the day of accession. There does not appear to have been any fixed rule as to which New Year’s day should be chosen ; but from a number of known cases, it appears to have been the general practice to count the regnal years from t-be New Year's day next after the accession, and to call the period between the accession day and the first New Year's day, ‘The beginning of the reign’; while the year from the New Year’s day was called ‘The first year’; and the following ones were numbered successively from it. Nevertheless, in the dates of several Assyrian and Babylonian sovereigns, there are cases of the year of accession being considered as the first year, thus giving </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tu:o</span><span class="font6"> reckonings for tlie reigns of the following monarchs: Shalmanezer, Tiglath Pileser, Sargon, Sennacherib and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nebuchadnezzar.&quot;</span></p>

It is also connected with Egyptian history, which in turn is connected with Babylonian history, which closely touches Jewish history; and incidentally it refers to a number of dates, and these latter definitely locate the beginning of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. We therefore include a number of quotations with the Scripture references.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">e. Pharaoh-Necho was king of Egypt, and also of Syria, a country lying to the northeast of Palestine. (This should not be confounded with Assyria, which lay further to the east along the Euphrates river, and of which Babylon was at that time the capital.) Pharaoh decided to enlarge, his domain by overrunning parts of Assyria. He left Egypt with a large, army, follow mg the Mediterranean coast line past Palestine, en route to Carchemish, a city on the banks of the Euphrates about 600 miles from Egypt and 500 miles north liom Babylon. On his way thither King Josiah attempied to hinder him at Megiddo and was killed. (2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chronicles 35:20-24) It appears that Pharaoh proceeded to Carciiemisli, stationed a strong gariison there, and returned to Egypt, without attempting to invade Assyria at that time. On his way back, about three mouths later (2 Kings 23:29-34; 2 Chronicles 36:4-3) he deposed Jehoahaz, whom the Jews had chosen as king in place of Josiah, and placed Jehoiakim on the throne at Jerusalem, taking Jehoahaz as prisoner to Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/. The following quotation is from “Smith’s Bible Dictionary,” under the heading of Carchemish:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">y.</span><span class="font6"> “Carchemish is not, as has generally been supposed, the classical Circesium. It lay much higher up the Euphrates. . . . It seems to have commanded the ordinary passage of the Euphrates, . . . and thus in the contentions between Egypt and Assyria its possession was of primary consequence. Carchemish appears to have been taken by Pharaoh-Necho shortly otter the battle of Megiddo, and retaken by Nebuchadnezzar after a battle thne years later.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font6"> As Josiah was slain in 628 B. C., three years later would be 625 B. C.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i.</span><span class="font6"> Note also the following from '‘Smith’s Bible Dictionary,” under the he ding of Pharaoh-Necho:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">j.</span><span class="font6"> “At the commencement of his reign he made war against the king of Assyria, and, being encountered on the way by Josiah, dei'ealed and slew the king of Judah at Megiddo. . . . Neclio seems to have soon returned to Egypt; perhaps lie was on his way thither when he deposed Jehoahaz. The army was probably posted at Carchemish, and was there defeated by Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year ot Neclio (this is evidently intended for the fourth year of Jehoiakim], that king | Neeho] not being, as it seems, then at its head. This battle led to the loss of all Asiatic dominions ot Egypt.” This was in 625 B. C., or the beginning of 624.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">k.</span><span class="font6"> Jeremiah 46:2 reads: “Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-Necho Icing of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish. which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jourth</span><span class="font6"> year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font6"> It was during this year, seven years before any captives had been taken to Babylon, that Jeremiah first states the length of time as seventy years that would come as a punishment for their evil ways. Jeremiah 25:11 reads:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">/. “And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font6"> This was also the date of the battle of Carchemish. </span><span class="font7">Josephus </span><span class="font6">makes the following statement, in “Antiquities,” </span><span class="font7">Book 10, </span><span class="font6">Chapter 6:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font7"> “In </span><span class="font6">the fourth year of Jehoiakim, one whose name was Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians; who at the same time went up with a great army to the city of Carchemish which was at the Euphrates; upon a resolution that he had taken to fight with Necho king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. [We recall that Necho had left a large garrison there three years previously. No doubt this was a constant irritation to Babylon.] When Necho understood the intention of the king of Babylon, that this expedition was made against him, he did not despise the attempt; but made haste with a great band of men to the Euphrates, to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar. And when they had joined battle he was beaten, and lost many thousands of his soldiers. So the king of Babylon passed over the Euphrates, and took all Syria as far as Pelusium, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">excepting Judea.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i.</span><span class="font6"> Pelusium is at the northeast corner of Egypt, and southwest of Judea. Josephus says that Nebuchadnezzar did not touch Jerusalem at this time, but passed it by. Nebuchadnezzar was not yet really “king of Babylon,” but was acting as general of his father’s army. It was at </span><span class="font7">Pelusium </span><span class="font6">that he heard of his father’s death. The follow</span><span class="font7">ing from </span><span class="font6">“McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s Cyclopedia” is to the point:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">j.</span><span class="font7"> “A few </span><span class="font6">years later, he was placed at the head of </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">Babylonian army, and sent by his father, who was now old and infirm, to chastise the insolence of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt. This prince had recently invaded Syria, defeated Josiah, king of Judah, at Megiddo, and reduced the whole tract from Egypt to Carchemish on the upper Euphrates, which in the partition of the Assyrian territories on the destruction of Nineveh had been assigned to Babylon. Necho had held possession of these countries for about three years, when Nebuchadnezzar led an army against him, defeated him at Carchemish in a great battle, recovered Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine, took Jerusalem [Josephus says he PASSED BY Jl’DEA on this trip, and to that the Scriptures agree], pressed forward to Egypt, and was engaged in that country or upon its borders when intelligence arrived which recalled him hastily to Babylon. Nabopolassar, after reigning twenty-one years, had died, and the throne was vacant; or, as there is some reason to think, Nebuchadnezzar, since he appeared to be the ‘king of Babylon’ to the Jews, had really been associated with his father. In some alarm, however, about the succession, he hurried back to the capital, accompanied only by his light troops; and crossing the desert, probably by way of Tad-mor, or Palmyra, reached Babylon before any disturbance </span><span class="font7">had </span><span class="font6">arisen and entered peaceably on his kingdom.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">k.</span><span class="font6"> The above authority dates this as 604 B. C., but it is easily proved that the correct date must have been 624 B. C.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I.</span><span class="font6"> In the Scripture there is no mention of Nebuchadnezzar’s taking Jerusalem </span><span class="font7">prior </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">617 B. C., </span><span class="font6">when Jehoiakim surrendered the city and was himself slain and thrown over the walls. Josephus says a threat of Nebuchadnezzar </span><span class="font7">so </span><span class="font6">frightened Jehoiakim (in 620 </span><span class="font7">B. C.) </span><span class="font6">that he consented </span><span class="font7">to pay tribute, and continued to do so for three years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">m.</span><span class="font6"> Note an interesting sidelight here. The Rechabites had been living in tents to the north of Judea. When Nebuchadnezzar followed Necho, taking over Syria and northern Palestine, the Rechabites would be in the line of march </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">the two armies. They became fearful and hurried </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font6">Jerusalem for safety. “But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Bain Ion came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go up to Jerusalem for fear </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of </span><span class="font7">the army of </span><span class="font6">the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.” (Jeremiah 35: 11) Jerusalem had not then been taken by Nebuchadnezzar, as </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font6">easily seen by verse </span><span class="font7">17, </span><span class="font6">which tells of a punishment </span><span class="font7">yet to come.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">ft.

Pharaoh-Necho still controlled Jerusalem </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font6">some extent, for he had set Jehoiakim upon his throne; </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font6">it </span><span class="font7">was </span><span class="font6">not until three years later that he </span><span class="font7">was defeated </span><span class="font6">by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. We quote again from Josephus, “Antiquities,” Book 10, Chapter 6:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">c. “But when Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned four years [therefore in his fifth year], which was the eighth year of Jehoiakim’s government over the Hebrews [Note how this harmonizes with Jeremiah 25:1; if Jehoiakim’s fourth year were Nebuchadnezzar’s first year, Jehoiakim’s eighth year would be Nebuchadnezzar’s fifth year. See chart], the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces against the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim; threatening upon his refusal to make war against him. He was affrighted at this threatening, and bought his peace with money; and brought the tribute he was ordered </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">three years.</span><span class="font6"> But on the third jeer [actually the eleventh ,\ear of Jehoiakim’s reign], upon hearing that the king of Babylon made an expedition against the Egyptians, he did not bring his tribute; yet he was disappointed in his hope; for the Egyptians durst not fight at that time.”</span></p>

Yet when he was come into the city, he did not observe the covenants he had made; but he slew such as were in the flower of their age. and such as were of the greatest dignity; together with their king, Jehoiakim, whom he commanded to be thrown before the wails, without any burial I Compare Jeremiah 22: IS, 19], and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the city; he also took the principal persons in dignity for captives, three thousand in number, and led them away to Babylon, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel, who was then but young [though in his twenty-fifth year, Ezekiel 1:1.2], And this was the end of King Jehoiakim, when he had lived thirty-six years and reigned eleven. But he was succeeded in the kingdom by Jehoiachin. ... He reigned three months and ten days.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">j.</span><span class="font6"> There is no Scriptural record of any prisoners or temple vessels being taken to Babylon prior to this date, 617 B. C. Daniel 1:1 (which refers to “the third year of Jehoiakim”) could not refer to the third year after Jehoiakim began to reign, but rather to the third year of his vassalage, for it was then he refused to pay tribute; for Nebuchadnezzar was not king of Babylon at that time, as already shown. (See B. C. 624 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I;</span><span class="font6"> 606 c, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d, e;</span><span class="font6"> 605 /.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">fc. Josephus adds another interesting item, “Antiquities,” Book 10, Chapter 7:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I.</span><span class="font6"> “After the king of Babylon had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin, he repented of what he had done; fearing lest he might excite a revolt, to revenge the death of his father. [A footnote adds that Nebuchadnezzar heard that Jehoiachin had already entered into a confederacy with the king of Egypt, as his successor (Zedekiah) did, and therefore sent an army against him, in the very beginning of his reign.] He therefore sent an army, and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem. Because he was of a gentle and just disposition, he did not desire to see the city endangered on his account; but took his mother, and kindred, and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of Babylon, and accepted of their oaths, that neither should they nor </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">city suffer any harm. This agreement, however, was not observed for a single year; for the king of Babylon gave orders to his generals to take all that were in the city captives ; both the youth and the handycraft men, and bring them bound to him; their number was 10,832; as also Jehoiachin, and his mother and friends. And when these were brought to him, he kept them in custody, and appointed Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, to be king; and made him take an oath that he would certainly keep the kingdom for him, and make no innovation, nor have any league </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">friendship with the Egyptians [which oath Zedekiah broke and which the Prophet declared was the direct cause why God sent Nebuchadnezzar later to overthrow him.—Ezekiel 17: 11-21].”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">&amp;. Let us here consider a scriptures which apparently contradict each other. 2 Kings 24:8 gives the age of Jehoiachin as eighteen years, and 2 Chronicles 36:9 gives it as eight. One is evidently an error by some copyist. (See note on page 53 of Volume II, Scripture Studies.) </span><span class="font7">This is not very important and does not affect chronology </span><span class="font6">Jn the least. There are a few others which have bothered historians, though'they do not affect the chronological chain either; for the entire period is otherwise covered. But they are interesting; and as some have been inclined to stumble over them we will notice them briefly.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">c. Daniel 1:1 reads: “In the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font6"> year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.'’ In the margin Of many of the Oxford Bibles the date of this is given as </span><span class="font7">607 B. C., </span><span class="font6">and the seventy years captivity is supposed to have begun the next year, 606 B. C. (See reference opposite </span><span class="font7">Verse </span><span class="font6">2) 2 Kings 24: 1 is often quoted to support this calculation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font6"> A careful reading of 2 Kings 24: 1-4 will show that it does not state that Nebuchadnezzar “came up'’ fo </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem. </span><span class="font6">The Hebrew word here rendered “came up'’ is rendered seventy-eight different ways in the King James version. It Is the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">alah.</span><span class="font6"> The Lord used bands of the Chaldees, and of the Syrians, of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon to harass Jehoiakim, no doubt at the command of Nebuchadnezzar; for Jehoiakim paid tribute </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to Nebuchadnezzar</span><span class="font6"> for relief.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font6"> Jeremiah 25: 1 informs us that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fourth</span><span class="font6"> year of Jehoiakim was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font6"> year of Nebuchadnezzar. Jeremiah 46:2 corroborates that statement. All the connecting dates between Nebuchadnezzar and Jehoiakim and Zedekiah fall into line, as already shown. These all show that Nebuchadnezzar could not have taken Jerusalem in the third year </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font6">Jehoiakim; for he did not defeat Pharaoh-Neeho until </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">fourth year of Jehoiakim. Therefore some other </span><span class="font7">ex</span><span class="font6">planation of the statement of Daniel 1: 1 must be found. Possibly some copyist has mode a mistake; and as it was not a connecting link in the chronological chain, God aid not see fit to have it corrected, but left us sufficient evidence to </span><span class="font7">cover </span><span class="font6">the entire period without this. However, Daniel was writing from Babylon, and being high in official position, possibly even copying from the Babylonian records as to dates, might have referred to this as the third year of Jehoiakim as being under King Nebuchadnezzar, which we have found to be the case. This third year of vassalage was the eleventh year of his reign, and was the date that Daniel 1: 2 was fulfilled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">/. Another text is Daniel 2:1, which reads: “And in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font6"> year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,” etc., he had his wonderful dream together with some exciting experiences for the wise men of his realm, as related in the second chapter. Verse 1, if given its usual interpretation that this was actually the second year that Nebuchadnezzar had been king, will not harmonize with Daniel 1:5,18. Notice the inconsistency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ff. Suppose the first year of Nebuchadnezzar to be the year that Daniel and his companions reached Babylon, and that Nebuchadnezzar immediately gave the instructions as recorded in Daniel 1 : 5. If the king had his dream in his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font6"> year, it must have occurred while Daniel and his companions were still at school. The latter part of the chapter says that Nebuchadnezzar was so impressed with the interpretation of the dream, and the evident favor of God with Daniel, that he “fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel. . . . Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. over the affairs of the province of Babylon : but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font6"> If all this occurred in the second year of Nebuchadnez-</span><span class="font7">i </span><span class="font6">nr, then Daniel and his companions must still have had a </span><span class="font7">year to attend school before they had their </span><span class="font6">examination </span><span class="font7">as </span><span class="font6">told in Daniel </span><span class="font7">1:18. Does </span><span class="font6">this look reasonable? Again, </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font6">Daniel were but twelve years of age when he went to Babylon, he would be but fourteen at this time. 'Would </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">king of Nebuchadnezzar’s ability place a boy of fourteen over the affairs of the province of Babylon, and make him chief of all his wise men? Would the king fall down and worship a boy of fourteen? Even if Daniel were twenty years old when he went to Babylon, as some suppose, he would be but twenty-two, altogether too young for such </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">position.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">i. We suggest the two following solutions, either of ■which would not be unreasonable, and would not be out of harmony witli other scriptures:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">j.</span><span class="font6"> A critical reading of Daniel 1: 1-3 does not demand the conclusion that what follows must have followed immediately. It is simply a prelude or introduction. Then follows an account of what occurred some time after they reached Babylon: Nebuchadnezzar instructed Ashpenaz to select some of the well-born children, preferably from among the king’s seed and princes, that they might be sent to school for three years. At the end of that time they were examined by the king himself, and found to be far above the average. No mention is made of any honor being bestowed upon them at that time. They drop out of sight for a while. In the meantime Nebuchadnezzar had taken and destroyed Jerusalem (606 B. C.) and brought many more captives to Babylon, and the remainder of tlie temple vessels. The treatment of these Hebrew captives by the heathen king of Babylon has been a subject of comment. They had many liberties, dwelt in communities by themselves, and were permitted to have laws of their own; their religious services were not interfered with particularly; and the men were often exempt from military service. Apparently there must have been some influence at court exerted on their behalf.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">k.</span><span class="font6"> God could as easily arrange for that as he did for the children of Israel through Joseph over 1700 years before. Again he used a king by giving him a dream. The wise men of the kingdom were called upon to tell the dream and the interpretation. Because they could not, orders went forth that all the wise men should be slain. This must have caused great consternation and wide publicity; just the end desired by Jehovah. Daniel and bis companions, recognized as wise men, were to be slam also (Daniel 1 : 20; 2:13) Because Daniel was used of God to reteal and interpret the dream, he was immediately honored by the king with high official position and would be ab’e to exert a great influence for good on behalf of his brethren, the Hebrew captives, as would also Daniel's three companions, who held high positions in the kingdom. Any suggestion from Daniel would therefore be given careful consideration by the king. Thus did God honor his loyal servants, and protect his covenant people; and also manifest his supervision over the affairs of the world, and cause even the heathen kings to bow to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I.</span><span class="font6"> In what year did all this take place? This date is not necessary to establish chronological connection, for that is fully covered elsewhere; but it is interesting, and should be found in harmony with other scriptures. If 606 B. C. were the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, as we have already found, 605 B. C. would be his twentieth year. The book of Daniel is written partly in Hebrew, partly in Aramaic. The Aramaic in many respects closely resembles the Arabic. In the Arabic the cypher is but a dot, like our period. Thus ten would be written with the figure for one followed by a dot, twenty by two and the dot; as for example, 1. for 10 and 2. for 20. It would be very easy for a copyist to overlook the dot, especially if his original were somewhat worn. Not noticing </span><span class="font7">the dot he </span><span class="font6">would </span><span class="font7">write it as for two Instead of twenty.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">m.</span><span class="font6"> However, the following appeals to us as the more reasonable: We note by the chart that the twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar synchronizes with his second year as world monarch. As long as Jehovah had a representative on a throne, in the typical kings of Israel (1 Chronicles 29:23), Nebuchadnezzar could not technically be said to be absolute monarch, as stated In Daniel 2:37,38. With the fall of Zedekiah, the last typical king, Nebuchadnezzar’s rule would become absolute. The book of Daniel was doubtless written long after tlie occurrence of the events; and his mind would naturally associate the rule of Nebuchadnezzar with the time he became the world monarch, and the typical kingdom of God was no more. In this sense the expression, “the second year of the reign </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[malekuth, </span><span class="font6">dominion, empirel of Nebuchadnezzar,” would be altogether proper, and in no way contradict the record of Kings, Chronicles, and Jeremiah. Daniel would be at least twenty-four years of age, even if taken captive at the age of twelve. This would be young enough for one to occupy so high a position of honor and trust, especially if appointed by Jehovah, although through the king. Joseph was thirty years old, and so was David, when exalted. We would not be surprised to learn later that Daniel was also thirty years of age when exalted. It would seem more in harmony with God's general method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n.</span><span class="font6"> Instances in modern history are in line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">o. William I of Germany became king of Prussia, the largest state of the German empire, in January, 1861. He became the emperor of Germany in January, 1871. Tims his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">first year as emperor</span><span class="font6"> would be his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">eleventh year as king.</span><span class="font6"> The expression, “The second year of the dominion of William 1,” would be correct, though it would be actually his twelfth year as king. The word used by Dani.l, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">malekuth,</span><span class="font6"> lias more the meaning of empire or dominion, and is rendered “reign” 21 times, and “kingdom'’ 49 times; whereas tlie word more generally translated “reign” is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">malak,</span><span class="font6"> meaning “to be a king,” and is used 28-1 times. Daniel 2:1 would be more properly rendered: “In the second year of the empire of Nebuchadnezzar.'’ etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">p. A similar case is that of Victoria, queen of England. She became queen in 1837, but did not become empress until the year 1877. Iler first year as empress would be her forty-first as queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&lt;]. Already acknowledged as a wise man before Nebuchadnezzar’s second campaign against Jerusalem in 606 B. C., Daniel no doubt knew not only the king, but many prominent men of tlie kingdom and generals of the army. He mt: ;t lune known of the letter Jeremiah had written in 613 !&gt;.&lt;’. to those captives who had been taken to Babylon in 617 B. C. When Nebuchadnezzar started for Jerusalem what would he more reasonable than for Daniel to tell him of Jeremiah's prophecy that he would take the city? It requires no stretch of imagination to read between the lines how. therelore, Nebuchadnezzar would be much interested in a prophet idio had foretold his victory, and who was also st ftiend of Daniel. What more reasonable than that he shot: d give special orders that Jeremiah be found and well Irealed? Zedekiah had left Jeremiah in the court ot the prison, and it was there that Nebuchadnezzar's genera s <sup>r</sup>ound him. What more reasonable ground as a basis for tl.e solicitude of the victorious king for a poor captive, as recorded in Jeremiah 39:11-14, and the explanation of tlie captain in 40:2-4?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">q </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font6"> Date of Ezekiel's vision of the Temple, as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">B. </span><span class="font6">C. 592 recorded in chapters 40 to 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&amp;. Ezekiel connects the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">twenty-fifth</span><span class="font6"> year of his captivity with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fourteenth year</span><span class="font6"> of the city's destruction, thus showing the synchronization </span><span class="font7">of the two </span><span class="font6">dates, which is in full harmony with all previous dates mentioned. This will be easily noticed by reference to the chart.—Ezck. </span><span class="font7">40:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">r The latest date mentioned by Ezekiel. He fore-B. C. 590 tells that Babylon shall have Egypt for wages for taking Tyre.—Ezekiel 29:17 to 30: 26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">6. From the above texts it is easily inferred that this was the first year of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, hence that Nebuchadnezzar had died that year or the year before. This would make the reign of Nebuchadnezzar about forty-four or forty-five years—625 to 5S0 </span><span class="font7">or </span><span class="font6">581 B. C. (instead of from 606 B. C. to 563 B. C., as given by most historians).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">t If Belshazzar reigned for seventeen years before B. C. 555 the fall of Babylon In 538, this would he the first year of Belshazzar, and also the date of Daniel’s vision as recorded in Daniel 7. However, this date is not material to the chronological line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">u On the above basis this would be the third year B. C. 553 of Belshazzar, and the date of Daniel’s vision </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">recorded in chapter 8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">c. Return of nearly 50,000 of the more zealous of the Jews to Jerusalem, with permission from Cyrus to rebuild the temple. (This should not be eoniounded with the permission given to Nehemiah to rebuild the walls of the city. That was given in 451 B. C.. eighty-two years later.—Daniel 9:25.) The returning Jews found their land vacant, their houses unoccupied, and their cirle&gt; si ill without inhabitant. They could move in immediately. The last of the Jews had left Judea about our Jul;, or August, 606 B. C. The returning Jews reached Judea ...bout the fourth month, our July or August, 536 B. C. Thus the land had been desolate the full seventy years By the seventh month they had been able io get their houses cleaned ami sufficiently settled that they could assemble at the ruins, of Jerusalem to hold the Day of Atonement sacrifices. Thus by October they “gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem [from the various cities where they had resettled]—to oiler burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses.” See Leviticus .16: 29 and Ezra 3: 1-7. Jerusalem would be a heap of ruins, but it was sacred to every Jewish heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font6"> Another text has been somewhat of a puzzle to some. Jeremiah 52:30 mentions Nebuchadnezzar as taking </span><span class="font7">some </span><span class="font6">more Jews to Babylon in his twenty-third year. Where </span><span class="font7">did </span><span class="font6">he find any more Jews, if the land had been denuded </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font6">his nineteenth year? Note the following from Josephus, “Antiquities,” Book 10, Chapter 9:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">e. “Accordingly both the people, and Johanau, disobeyed </span><span class="font6">the counsel of God, which he gave by the prophet, and removed into Egypt, and carried Jeremiah and Baruch along with them. While they were there, God signified to the prophet that the king of Babylon was about making an expedition against the Egyptians: and commanded him to foretell to the people that Egypt should be taken, and that the king of Babylon should slay some of them and take others captive, and bring them to Babylon : which things came to pass accordingly. For on the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem, which was the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, he made an expedition against Coele-Syria; ami when he had possessed himself of it, he made war against the Ammonites and the Moabites; and when he bad brought all these nations under his subjection, he fell upon Egypt, in order to overthrow it. And he slew the king that then reigned, and set up another; and took those Jews that were captr-es, and led them away to Bain Ion. And such was the end of the nation of the Hebrews, it having gone twice beyond Euphrates. For I he people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria by the Assyrians, in the days of King Hoshea. After vhicli the people of the two tribes, that remained after Jerusalem was taken, were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon and Chaldea. Now as to Shalmaneser, he removed the Israelites out .of their country, and placed therein the nation of the Cuthians; who had formerly belonged to the interior of Persia and Media; but were then called Samaritans, by taking the name of the country to which they were removed.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2e</sup>A little study of the chart, together with the Scripture citations and the quotations, will show how simple the whole matter is, when properly located. The date of references given in Jeremiah and Ezekiel may be quickly ascertained by looking at the chart, under the names of the various persons mentioned. Thus the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar is seen to be 617 B. C.; the fifth year of Jehoia-chin’s captivity is 612 B. C. Just find the person named, the year of his reign, prophecy or captivity; and follow the vertical line down to the lower line of dates. It would also be interesting to use a Bible atlas in connection with the study, and thus locate the various places mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup>We are not called upon to harmonize these with the tangled records of secular history. “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness ; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished Unto all good works.”—2 Timothy 3:16,17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR AUGUST 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The fruit of the spirit is . . . peace.”—Galatians 5: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the titles given our Lord is the Prince of Peace. The body members must be transformed into his likeness. These must come to the point of possessing the peace of the Master. When Jesus was speaking to his disciples shortly before his departure he said: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (John 14: 27) Thus he defines the peace that the Christian must possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One has “peace with God” when his complete consecration to the Lord has been accepted and Jehovah has justified him freely. Then there is reconciliation between God and the one thus consecrating, which reconciliation is based upon the merit of Christ Jesus’ blood. Begotten now as a new creature in Christ, he begins to develop the “peace of God, which passeth all understanding.” (Philippians 4:7) This peace is one of the fruits of the spirit. None can possess it save those who are begotten of the holy spirit. The peace of God means a calm, restful condition of mind and heart resulting from full confidence in the Lord and his promises. A Christian necessarily must come in contact with the world and with imperfect brethren. He must of necessity be surrounded by trials and tribulations, strife and turmoil. But he who really loves God and confidently abides in the love of the Lord will not be disturbed by these outward trials. Nothing can shake his faith in the Lord, nothing can disturb his peace of mind and heart; for he is trusting in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In proportion as one grows in the likeness of the Lord, in that same proportion will he possess the peace of God and increase in that peace to the point of absolute rest in him. Such peace of God results from the holy spirit operating upon the mind; but in order for the spirit thus to operate upon the mind the mind must be kept upon things pertaining to the Lord and his arrangement. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.” (Isaiah 26:3) It is vitally essential, therefore, to the Christian that he keep in mind the exceeding great and precious promises given to him by the heavenly Father; and relying upon these, he develops a trust and confidence and rest in the Lord which bring to him great peace. With confidence he can know that, notwithstanding he is surrounded upon every side by enemies, he shall not be overwhelmed. “For the Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.”—Isaiah 50:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This fruit or grace of the spirit is the result of growing in the likeness of the Lord, putting on love. Hence the Apostle admonishes: “Above all . . . things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.” (Colossians 3:14,15) Brethren</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">should see to it not only that they have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">peace </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font6">God, but that they dwell together in peace and enjoy the peace of God, without which none shall see his face.— Hebrews 12:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR AUGUST 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The fruit of the spirit is . , . longsuffering and gentleness.”—Galatians 5:</span><span class="font7"> 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">RUITS of the spirit are not developed suddenly. They are not of a mushroom growth, but of a gradual development. Among the precious fruits of the spirit the Apostle names long-suffering and gentleness. Both of these are really the outgrowth of love, the fruit of the spirit. In analyzing love St. Paul says that it is long-suffering and kind. To be long-suffering means to be slow to anger, cheerfully enduring a wrong or injustice without complaining against it. Many Christians are misunderstood. In fact, being misunderstood is a part of the Christian’s suffering. Being misunderstood often results in injustice being heaped upon one. Since the Lord has promised that all things shall work together for good to those who are called according to his purpose and who love him, it seems quite reasonable that many of these trials which bring suffering upon the brethren are for the very purpose of permitting such a one to develop the fruit of the spirit; namely, long-suffering, resulting in fortitude. Only love can prompt one to be long-suffering; hence only the spirit of the Lord can develop this trait of character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentleness means a quiet and refined manner, the very opposite of harshness, a tenderness toward others, a peaceful attitude toward those with whom we come in contact. One in the world may have an outward manifes'ation of gentleness; but when the crucial test comes, the gentleness will disappear. True gentleness like unto Christ can be possessed and manifested only by those who have his spirit and who are permitting that spirit of love to dwell in them richly. This comes by filling the mind with the precious promises of the Lord and by striving to copy the character likeness of the Lord as manifested in his Word. It is love that prompts one to suffer an injustice and yet be kind to the wrong-doer. It requires suffering under such conditions to enable one to grow gentle. It would be absolutely impossible for one to develop and manifest the fruit of gentleness without some adversity; hence when adversity comes one should rejoice, because it leads to the development of this attribute of character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The perfect quality of gentleness is manifested by Jehovah and his beloved Son Christ Jesus. After King David had been delivered out of the hand of his enemies, he extolled and magnified the Lord Jehovah and recounted the many goodnesses that God had bestowed upon him, and then added: “Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; and tliy gentleness hath multiplied me [made me great].” (2 Samuel 22:36) He who would be like the Lord must permit long-suffering to develop in him that kind and gentle disposition like unto his Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The rich glow spreads. Great Fashioner divine, Who sparest not, in thy far-seeing plan, The blows that shape the character of man, Or fire that makes him yield to touch of thine. Strike on, then, if thou wilt I For thou alone Canst rightly test the temper of our will, Or tell how these base metals may fulfil Thy purpose—making all our life thine own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Only we do beseech thee, let the pain Of fiery ordeals through which we go Shed all around us such a warmth and glow, Such cheerful showers of sparks in golden rain, That hard hearts may be melted, cold hearts fired, And callous hearts be taught to feel and see That discipline is more to be desired</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Than all the ease that keeps us back from thee.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MARY MAGDALENE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--Avgust 5-----The Gospels----</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GRATITUDE FOB DEMON DELIVERANCE—ULTIMATE RELEASE FOB ALL FROM DEMONS—MARY’S WARM DEVOTION HONORED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">•‘Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: he is our he!r&gt; and our shield.”—Psalm 33:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">UK study today is of Mary Magdalene, the mosr prominent of the band of women associated with our Lord’s life and ministry. Evidently the name Mary was very common in the Israel of our Lord’s day; there are at least five mentioned in the New Testament. There is some uncertainty as to the origin of tlie name Magdalene by which this notable woman, so faithful to the Lord, was distinguished from her sisters in service. Perhaps she was from Magdala of Galilee. With the exception of Judas who came from Judea, all the apostles and all the women who were associated with the Lord’s ministry were from Galilee. Jiarj Magdalene is earliest introduced into the Go pels by Luke, when he relates Ills account of Jesus’ ministry in Galilee. (Luke 8:2) When he mentions her name, lie at once tells that Jesus had cast seven demons out of her—a significance in number which probably indicates a very bad case of demoniacal possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup>Mary Magdalene’s mime has been much misused. Tradition 1ms lined her as the woman of the city, of Luke 7: 37; and homes tor penitent fallen women have long been and still are styled '‘Magdalene homes,” and the women themselves are designated by Mary’s name. There is no foundation lor the assumption, however; and, if it really mattered, it wou.d be true to say that Mary’s name has in this respect been much hurt by the slander. We must not think of Mary as a sinful woman before the Lord delivered her, but as of a highly-strung temperament, one whose senses were much keener than or 'inary. Lacking restraint she had fallen into a stite of mental unbalance, and had been seiuid by some of the many demons who in our Lord’s day roamed about seeking places wherein they might dwell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>J</sup>Those who have this temperament, which is found more frequently among women than men, are much more subject to attack by demons and more liable to be brought under their i.iiluence than are those of a duller mind. When spirit obsession is rife, as was the case at our Lord’s first advent, and is now at the time of the second advent, all persons of highly-strung temperament are made the objective of demons, and are ofttimes their sport. Those of the Lord’s p.'op.e who are of such temperament should pay especial heed that they be not caught in this trap of the de.il. A naturally sharp mind receives certain suggestions; and if there is lack of balance, that is, if there is not sul.i.'ient meditation as to their relative values, a measure of conceit is apt to obtain a foothold; and this, in turn, m ikes more room for the evil spirit to entrench itself in the mind. When once a person has allowed his mind to be held at the disposal of thoughts which may be suggested, it is very difficult to close it to demoniacal influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup>Mary, quick-witted, sharp, and evidently with a good deal of natural energy, had given place to an evil spirit; and at last her mind had become the possession of at least seven of them. The unfortunate woman would be distracted by warring thoughts; for the demons would certainly not agree except in the fact of retaining possession of her mind. How Mary came in contact with Jesus we are not told. Perhaps it was a piteous appeal made to tlie Lord which brought her deliverance, or it may have been his pitying observation of her need. However It happened, after her deliverance she was ever his loving devoted follower, faithful to him in her life, and to him in his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GRATITUDE FOR DEMON DELIVERANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup>Tbe minislry of Jcu. m (lalilie is usually conceived as pictorial representation depicts it: Jesus, the Teacher, leading a company of twelve men about the cities and vi'l ges. But that is true only in part, as this record shows. When Luke first mentions Mary .Magdalene it is to tell of her and some other women as accompanying Jesus and the aposties when he began his second tour in Galilee. Each of tlmse women had boon blessed of the Lord by being delivered from demoniacal influences, though all had not been so much under that diead power as Mary. They went with him out of gratitude for what he had done for them. Evidently some of them had a measure of wealth; ior “they ministered to him of their substance.” One was the wife of Herod's steward. They were re :dy to share the difficulties of such unusual service as well as its joys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup>This no'able service is mentioned directly only by Luke, though Matthew and Mark refer to it. (Luke 8:2,3; Matthew 27:55,50; Mark 15:40,41) By this means were met many of the needs of Jesus and tlie disciples during that important and strenuous time. When Jesus sent out the apost’es, and afterwards the seventy, two by two, they were told to make no provision for food; for, he said, “the laborer is worthy of his hire.’’ But it was a very different matter for thirteen men to appear in a village than for two to do so. Two men might easily be hospitably entertained, but our Lord's company not so easily; and from all we know of him we would judge that he would be much more likely to provide for his own than expect the villagers to provide for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup>We know that the company had a treasurer, Judas, who carried the bag, and who sometimes stole what was in it. (John 12:6) It was, then, of God’s providence that these dexout women thus ministered to Jesus and to the disciples that as far as possible their temporal needs could be met, and that the work of the Lord might go on without hindrance. God always did, and always will, provide for his ministry. Jesus never sought his sustenance from those to whom he ministered. He never took up a collection, either during the course of his ministry in a city or village, or when his mission was over. To whatever place he went he went to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup>If the question be asked: Why did Jesus permit women who had been subject to demoniacal obsession to travel about with him, we answer that he accepted the service for Its value: these women could and would give the best and quickest service for the needs of tlie apostles whom he took with him. It is the nervous temperament which does the most work in the world. That temperament acts quickest and most frequently, and is the most serviceable in the interests of the kingdom of heaven. God’s true servants are never phlegmatic nor lethargic. Also, the Lord permitted the service for love’s sake. He knew that those who sacrifice of their substance or time or ability are those who make most progress in tlie will of God. Happy are those who can combine these sacrifices. Also, our Lord accepted the service of these noble and self-sacrificing women, formerly troubled by evil spirits, for the same reason that he took Matthew tlie publican into the company of the apostles: He wanted to show his compassion and love for these who, like the publicans, had been under the power of sin, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">had been more directly under the control of Satan than they. He came to save his people from their sins, and to deliver them from the bondage of the devil.—Luke 13: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">^Demoniacal power, particularly in evidence at the first advent, is without doubt one of the great factors in the present evil condition of humanity. There are those who deny that spirit obsession is a cause of lunacy; but there is abundant evidence to show that vast numbers of those who are unable to control themselves and are unfitted for freedom in human society are the subjects of demoniacal possession. But besides those who are subjects of demon power, there are many who appear to l&gt;e partially so. Satan’s purpose is to fight to retain possession of the mastery over human affairs, and part of his policy is to get full control of the human family. In this he is directly aided by those of the fallen angels who, though not absolutely under his control, ever seek to serve evil, and who with Satan are mutually pleased with evil to humanity and with all opposition to God. These do all they can to gain or to pervert the minds of men in order that the truths of God may find no lodgment there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup>The elose association with Jesus which these women enjoyed in the fellowship which their service afforded proves that their deliverance from demoniacal bondage was complete. Many who have been in that bondage are tempted to believe that they cannot get real freedom. Their former evil controllers seek to return; and Satan uses these attempts to make believe the deliverance is not absolute, even as he tempts the Lord’s people to believe that because they are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tempted</span><span class="font6"> to old sins they have neither full justification nor full deliverance from the dominion of Satan. The power of the Lord is supreme over all that of the enemy, and he whom Christ makes free is free indeed.—John 8: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Vow should be taken and kept; but probably direct service, where it can be undertaken, is one of the best means of keeping the mastery over the power of evil whether of Satan or of the demons. In the company of Jesus there is always safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup>In permitting these women to give their loving service Jesus was not training women to be missionaries. They were with him to serve in the material things; but, without doubt, they helped his mission. It was not customary for women and men to go about together. Indeed, it is on record that the disciples were surprised when they saw Jesus conversing at the well with the woman of Samaria. (John 4:27) There was no familiarity. The women were modest, the men were earnest, and all were very busy in their Master’s service. These were brave women, both enduring a measure of hardship, and certainly sharing in the contempt poured upon Jesus and the apostles by the leaders of Israel. It is almost certain that their good was evilly spoken of. Such ministry for the Lord could obtain only under the special circumstances. But there has been and is now amongst women devoted to the Lord much of similar service. To enable their husbands to give time and care to the Lord’s work many noble women make great sacrifices of what might be properly considered their rights and claims upon their husbands for time and attention. The Lord is not unmindful of such service of love, and will surely reward it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup>Mary Magdalene and Jesus’ mother and a few other faithful women were on Calvary when Jesus was crucified. For a time they stood afar off; then they came near till, at the end, they were close to the cross and could hear Jesus speak. (Matthew 27:55,56; John 19:25-27) When the body was buried, they watched where it was placed (Mark 15:47) ; and when the great stone was rolled into its place and Joseph had gone away, Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary” stayed on, sitting over against the sepulchre. (Matthew 27:61) They were loath to leave even the body of their beloved Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup>To Mary was given the great favor to be the first to see Jesus after his resurrection, the first to hear him speak or to speak to him. and the first to be charged with a message from him. On the morning after the sabbath she and tlie other women went very early to the tomb, before daylight had broken. They found the tomb empty, and Mary immediately run to tell I’eter and John. Later when the two apostles had gone away, the angels spoke to the women and bade them carry a message to the disciples. The other women went away, puzzled by what they saw and heard ; but Mary lingered on. Perhaps she was not so ready to believe this strange message as she might have been, but her words and actions reveal a wonderful depth of love and devotion. She believed that her beloved Master was dead; yet the tomb was empty. Of that fact she had satisfied herself; for she had gone beyond the others and had peered into it. When the gardener, as she supposed, questioned her why she was weeping, she said: “They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.” (John 20: 13) She did not understand that it was her Lord to whom she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup>Though we are not told why our Lord first manifested himself to Mary, we may very readily and properly say that her favor came as a reward for her devotion. And her love for Jesus must have arisen out of love for God ; for that is the source of all true love. We have already noted that the women who ministered to Jesus were privileged to that service not because they were called to it, but because their loving devotion caused them to offer it. Those have most of the joy of the Lord who are most ready and willing to serve, and whose heart's devotion is in their service. It is by readiness of heart that one most quickly perceives the privilege of service. There may be service for the Lord which has considerable amount of joy in the actual serving; but where this is done by a very willing mind and out of a loving heart, the joy is greatest, and the firstfruits of God’s blessings are received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup>.Tesus’ first act of ministry after his resurrection was that of healing the broken heart of a devoted follower and wiping her tears of sorrow away, a beautiful symbol of the ministry of healing of him who is now exalted to be a Prince and a Savior.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>MARY AND MARTHA</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---August 12---The Gospels---</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BOTH TRULY DEVOTED, BUT DIFFERENTLY MANIFESTED IT--LAZARUS RAISED FROM THE DEAD--LOVE AND AVARICE IN CONTRAST.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not he taken from her.&quot;—Luke 10: 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE position of Martha and Mary of Bethany among tlie great men and women of the New Testament is assured to them because they have so prominent a place in the picture of our Lord’s life. Each of fine character, they were made great by God’s great favor. Wherever the story of our Lord’s life is known, the home in Bethany is always remembered in tender association with him. How the sisters and their brother Lazarus came into Jesus’ life we may not know. It may have been that Lazarus had heard Jesus teaching in Jerusalem; or perhaps the sisters themselves had heard the Lord, and Martha had invited him to her house, which was about two miles out of Jerusalem. It is almost certain that Martha’s hospitality was the immediate link. Both sisters were of those who waited for the hope of Israel, or Jesus could not have become their familiar friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup>.Terusalem had no home for Jesus: for Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea were not bold enough to take him as their friend; nor is there any record of that city’s ever providing rest or refreshment for the Son of God. Jesus on his visits to Jerusalem would sleep at night on the Mount of Olives (Luke 22:39), or perhaps sometimes at Bethany. We know of only three occasions when Jesus was In the home in Bethany. The first and perhaps best known is recorded by Luke (Ch. 10: 38-42), when Martha invited Jesus, but through over-anxiety to serve spoke rebukingly to him. The other two occasions are recorded by John. (Chapters 11 to 12:8) But the first suggests an intimacy already existing; evidently Jesus was “at home” with the Sisters and was not merely a guest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>s</sup>These glimpses into our Lord’s life arc very pleasing; for we know that there could be but few occasions when he could rest and feel at home as in the bosom of a loved family. And it would be a great pleasure to him to have the quiet fellowship which now and again the home in Bethany afforded. Though it was Martha’s hospitality Which gave Jesus this advantage, without doubt both Mary and Lazarus were as desirous of having him as she was. Each would have done what Martha did, because they all loved him. The family had its reward; for the story of Martha and Mary of Bethany, and of Lazarus their brother, is a part of human history, and has entered into the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUE DEVOTION DIFFERENTLY MANIFESTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘Without doubt the Lord used his friends for his ministry, as well as that he used them in it. Martha and Mary, so different in characteristics and temperament, are not brought into Luke’s Gospel narrative to give interest, but for the instruction of the Lord’s people, to show how to discriminate In the use of the ordinary things of life. Both women loved the Lord, but Martha with all her desire to serve did not so truly apprehend our Lord’s desire as did Mary. The event proved that Mary, more meditative, served him more acceptably; for in a truer perception of the privilege of having the Lord she used tlie occasion so as to enable him to teach her and to impart something of liis spirit. It was such Jesus sought. The service which Martha gave the Lord was more like that of (he women who went with Jesus and the apostles to minister to them, while Mary’s was more like that of the apostles—learning of him in order to carry on his work. Both phases of service are accessary. Jesus, always ready to serve what he had to dispense, and Mary more ready to feed her mind than her body, needed someone to look after their material interests. Neither teacher nor disciple could continue unless each had food for the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup>Martha’s initial mistake was in making too much of the occasion to serve, and in encumbering herself with much preparation. It was through this that she forgot herself; she rebuked the Lord, and also told him what he should do about Mary. Thus she intruded upon his ministry; for they themselves received him as a messenger of Jehovah. She was concerned with her hospitality more than with trying to discover what the Lord would really wish to have. Hostesses are often tempted to act as Martha did. Happy are they who in their hospitality to the saints can combine in true proportion both giving and receiving. If it be suggested that Mary might have been more thoughtful for Martha, the reply must be that Jesus gave no indication that Mary had lacked; and he told Martha that Mary should not be deprived of her portion of the feast which he, their guest, was providing. It was more important that an earnest disciple should be instructed than that Martha’s elaborate meal should be prepared and eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup>The second mention of the sisters is when they were in great distress because their brother, Lazarus, was unexpectedly stricken with sickness and death. (John 11:1-44) Immediately the seriousness of the sickness was discovered, the sisters sent a messenger to Jesus, then in Perea. It was an affectionate appeal which they sent: “Lord, ... he whom thou lovest is sick.” (John 11:3) Jesus did not at once respond. As if in explanation he said to his disciples: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” (John 11: 4) After two days he said to tlie disciples: “Let us go into Judea again.” They were doubtful about his going; for recently the people had attempted to stone him. But it was necessary that he should go. He said therefore: “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world” (John 11:9), as if he would tell them: “I must work while the daylight remains”; and, well knowing that no evil could befall him until liis hour had come, he led his disciples to Bethany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’Lazarus died four &lt;hi\s before Jesus’ arrival. The family was well known, and many of the Jews from Jerusalem were there to comfort the two sisters. Martha heard that Jesus was coming and went out to meet him. (John 11:30) Mary, apparently unaware of the Lord’s approach, stayed in the house. On meeting Jesus Martha said: “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died” (John 11:21), and added: “But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.” (V. 22) Jesus said: “Thy brother shall rise again.” Martha said that she knew he would rise in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus replied that the power of resurrection was in him; and though he did not plainly say so, he intimated that he could even then restore tlie corrupting body and give back her brother. Martha declared her faith that he was the Christ, the Son of God, but left him to tell Mary that the Master had come and was calling for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup>Jesus was still where Martha had met him. Mary hurried to him, and falling at his feet, said as Martha had done: “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.” (V. 32) It was not reproach that they expressed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">but a realization of how different things would have been bad he been present. Mary was weeping, and those who followed her were weeping; and Jesus groaned in spirit, and was troubled. Upon his enquiring where Lazarus was laid, they led him to the tomb. Jesus wept. Again groaning within himself he approached the grave. He commanded that the stone which covered it be taken away. Martha, </span><span class="font7">now </span><span class="font6">the hesitant, said: “Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.” (V. 39) Jesus lifted </span><span class="font7">up </span><span class="font6">his eyes to heaven and said: “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.” (V. 41) He spoke aloud to his Father, and thanked him for hearing him. Then, in that confidence he cried with a loud voice: “Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">napkin.” Jesus said: “Loose him, and let him go.”— Verses 43, 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>9</sup>This was tlie greatest miracle of Jesus’ life. It was wrought as with the special cooperation of his Father; and clearly it was arranged, even as Jesus intimated when he said: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” (V. 4) On two previous occasions Jesus had resuscitated tlie dead. He had raised the young daughter of Jairus, and the young man of Nain. But a greater miracle was necessary. God foresaw that Satan would corrupt the truths of the gospel. He knew that a false church would proclaim that the resurrection of Jesus was the reunion of “soul” and body, for a short time separated. Hence this miracle, which as a revivification of a body, is greater than that of the supposed revivification of the body of Jesus. If resurrection is only reunion of the body and the soul, then in no way had Jesus the preeminence, nor was he the first to be raised from the dead. (Acts 26:23) The record of this miracle ought to have prevented acceptance of the creedal teaching concerning Jesus’ resurrection. The Scriptures never declare a resurrection of the body, either of Jesus </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">of any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup>This miracle therefore was for God’s purposes, for his glory, and for the manifestation of the power of his Son, as well as for the guidance of the church. Upon whomsoever the choice would fall to be the subject of this greatest of all miracles in the ministry of Jesus, he and his family would of necessity be brought into much prominence. No outsider could be honored. The favor fell upon the one family that gave Jesus a home, and Martha and Mary and Lazarus were thus favored to suffer for the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There are many instructive features in this wonderful Story. It tells in symbol of the glorious deliverance from death of those who are therein bound, and who after the stone of the present kingdom of Satan’s dominion is rolled away will, at tlie word of command, come forth to their loved ones, to be loosed into the glorious liberty of the children of God. (Bomans 8:21) But one lesson stands out prominently—that not all suffering which comes upon the friends of Jesus is Intended as chastisement, nor of necessity as trial out of which lessons are to be gained. Some sufferings are indeed for our perfecting; but some are for the benefit of others, and some are specially for God’s purposes. God has the right to use his own for his glory; and this he does. Satan often brings the Lord’s people into sharp temptation; for either in or after a sharp experience there is a sense of not having learned any special lesson by it. Let tlie Lord’s people remember that this Bethany experience was not specially for lessons for Lazarus or for his sisters. It was for the glory of God. The chief lesson is that of trust in God. “Faith can firmly trust him, come what may.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>12</sup>The third incident related of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">home in </span><span class="font7">Bethany </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">when Jesus arrived there on his last visit to Jerusalem. </span><span class="font7">He </span><span class="font6">had come up with the throng that was making Its </span><span class="font7">way </span><span class="font6">to the Passover feast; and he stayed in Bethany, and almost certainly at tlie Bethany home. Martha made </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">supper and also served. Lazarus sat at the table </span><span class="font7">with </span><span class="font6">Jesus. Wliile supper was on, the account reads, “then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.” (John 12:3) This was an act of loving devotion, ever to be on record wherever the gospel of the kingdom is preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup>Mary’s alabaster box of ointment serves as a text for many a sermon on using present opportunities of service rather than waiting till a loved </span><span class="font7">one </span><span class="font6">has gone: for a </span><span class="font7">flower </span><span class="font6">to cheer in life is better than one on a grave as a token of fond remembrance. But here Mary’s loving action cannot be set in contrast with Martha’s service, as is frequently done; for Martha was pouring out her ointment in loving service attending to the needs of their guest. </span><span class="font7">We must </span><span class="font6">look elsewhere for the lesson. Jesus said: “She hath done this for my burial.” He knew that a few days hence </span><span class="font7">he </span><span class="font6">would be killed, and would thus complete his work and </span><span class="font7">his </span><span class="font6">course. He graciously accepted Mary’s offering as for his body in death—and thus gave her a part in the last possible service for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup>May we not think that Mary already perceived that Jesus was approaching a crisis In his life? Perhaps her meditative mind discerned something of sadness in his manner. It is certain that Jesus had been showing a measure of aloofness; for on the road to Bethany he had walked apart from the disciples. (Luke 19:28) Mary desired to show her love her admiration, her sense of high appreciation; and so she took her precious little alabaster box and poured its fragrant ointment on him. Some of ths disciples, probably led by Judas (for John specially mentions him), said that the action was wasteful and that ths ointment could have been sold and the money given to the poor. Evidently some of them spoke to Mary of this, as </span><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font6">to say that her action was an intrusion as well as wasteful. But the Lord rebuked them. He said: “Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.”— John 12:7.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The World’s Big Rivers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">E PLACE the Mississippi river at the head of the list The Amazon drains a larger area, carries several times as much water, and is longer than the Mississippi proper; but the Mississippi and its tributary the Missouri, when combined, have a total length of 4,650 miles, which is 650 miles longer than the combined Amazon and Ucayale. In point of length the North American river properly comes first. The actual length of the Mississippi proper is 2,553 miles. The drainage area is 1,259,000 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The valley of the Mississippi is the granary of the world. It produces in itself more wheat, oats, and corn than any other one entire country on the whole planet; and it is second in its production of barley and fourth in rye. It has sixty percent of the population of the United States and produces eighty percent of the wealth of the Union. In point of importance to the world at this time it is of far greater value than the Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When the Kaiser said during the war that “America is now a blown egg-shell,” his observation showed that he had never been in the Mississippi valley. If he had ever seen what that valley contains, he would have thought a long time before speaking in such a trifling way of an area singularly fertile and blessed with a climate unsurpassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Amazon, which is really the world’s largest river, is so much larger than the Mississippi in the amount of water carried that it staggers one’s imagination to think of its volume. In flood time the Mississippi at New Orleans is big enough. It is always 60 feet deep and 3,100 feet wide at that point. It always carries one-third of all the river water of the United States. Always, every minute, it passes into the sea a bulk of water equivalent to twenty acres forty-two feet in depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But the Amazon! It h- s a drainage area of 8,000,000 square miles, is 180 feet in depth at a distance of 750 miles from its mouth, and in its entire system there are 50,000 miles of navigable waterways, as against 15,700 miles of such waterways on the Mississippi and its branches. River navigation in the U. S. A. as actually practised is such a sad subject that we dislike to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> about it. A few old broken-down, wheezy, flat-bottomed, side-wheel steamers, and we are through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When it comes to water, the Amazon every minute pours out into the ocean a body of water such as might be piled upon a twenty-acre lot if the pile were 200 feet high, or nearly five times as much as leaves the mouth of the Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Great as are the undeveloped possibilities of the Mississippi, they are as nothing compared to the future which awaits the Amazon. Here is a region of such fertility that only swarming billions of people could ever subdue it. But they will be here shortly, and it will be subdued. Just now these billions are in their graves, awaiting the summons of the Prince of Peace to call them forth. (John 5:28) The valley of the Amazon is so choked with plant and animal life that it is fairly falling over itself. From its headwaters there is river communication to the Orinoco River on the north and to the Rio de la Plata on the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">••The Egyptian Hope**</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Nile, the Egyptian Hope, as it was anciently called, with a drainage area of 1,082,000 square miles, is 100 miles longer than the Amazon, but no one would think of it as a greater river. The lake in which it rises, Victoria Nyanza, is next in size to Lake Superior, the largest fresh-water lake on the globe, and is 4,000 feet above sea level In the neighborhood of this lake there are abundant and regular rainfalls, and the Nile issues from the lake a full-grown river. On its way north it passes through arid regions for such a long distance that it actually grows smaller instead of larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There is one place where it grows much larger, however, and that is where the Blue Nile joins the parent stream. Once a year, beginning in the month of June, the Blue Nile is in flood, due to the melting of the snows on the Blue Mountains. The rise in the waters continues for three months; and by September 1st the river, which had been twenty-five feet above its low level at Cairo, begins to recede. It is this annual flood which constitutes the source of Egypt's wealth. The silt brought down from Abyssinia is fertile food for plants, though it often fills the canals made to carry it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A series of three great dams have been built across the Nile, to husband and regulate the flow of water. One of these is near Cairo; another is at Assiout, 250 miles upstream; and the third, at Assouan, 400 miles still further upstream, at the foot of the first cataract, is one of the great engineering works of the world. It is 130 feet in height and will pay for itself, principal and interest, in a short time, in the rent obtainable from land growing two crops per year which cannot now be used at all</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The upper part of the Nile is choked with vegetable growths so thick and luxuriant that in places for miles at a stretch the surface of the river is completely hidden from view and elephants can and do cross its surface with no danger whatever of falling in. Here is another vast section of the world a thousand miles in length and in many places of great width that really needs a throng of humans to keep it in order. In due time it will have them. The Missouri-Mississippi, Amazon, and Nile are the only rivers in the world 4,000 or more miles in length. The Nile is 4,100 miles long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Great Asiatic Rivera</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">E DO, not hear much about the Yenisei, 3,400 miles in length, drainage area 1,100,000 square miles, the great river of Middle Siberia. We do not hear much of Siberia itself; but a returned American soldier, who was stationed there when Unde Sam was helping to repatriate the Czechoslovaks, and who traveled for thousands of miles along the line of the Trans-Siberian railway, reports that the soil is a black loam several feet thick, capable of raising tremendous crops under proper cultivation, and only waiting a decent government to be a paradise. The Yenisei though not a deep river in its upper readies is navigable for 600 miles from its mouth by ocean-going vessels. The mouth of the Yenisei, in the Arctic Ocean, is open for trade with Norway for six weeks in the middle of the summer, each season. The polar ioe-cap is rapidly melting, and in a few yean the valley of the Yenisei will swarm with people now asleep in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Yang-tse-kiang, the next largest river in Asia, 3,302 miles long, drainage ana 950,000 square miles, rises in the mountains of Tibet, and after mon than a thousand miles of the wildest and most beautiful of mountain scenery passes peacefully through one of the most fertile and most densely populated areas on earth, the heart of China. In 1861 a Chureh-of-England battleship and opium squadron, engaged in spreading &quot;practical” European Christianity among the heathen Chinese, ascended the river for mon than 800 miles. In the month of February the tides rise in the river as far as Lake Po-Yang, 436 miles from the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Southern Hemisphere</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Congo, 3,000 miles in length, drainage area 1,600,000 square miles, is next in size; it is an African river in the general form of a great arc, finding its outlet on the West Coast below the equator. It seems unfortunate that the Congo, though ten miles in width at its mouth, is navigable for only 110 miles by oceangoing steamers; but above the rapids there ars 7,000 miles of navigable streams, where a population of 30,000,000 natives has managed to live in spite of their unpleasant habit of eating one another and in spite of all the depredations that have been made upon them by the &quot;Christian” slave-dealers and rumsellers that have gone there to civilize them. The volume of w«-ter issuing from the mouth of the Congo is only exceeded by the Amazon. Its basin is largely filled with impenetrable forests, due to the rich soil and the hot, moist climate. There are two rainy seasons annually in this territory and the time will come when it will produce an almost limitless amount of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Parana-Rio de la Plata, 2,910 miles long, drainage area 1,240,000 square miles, is the great river which does for the southern part of South America what the Amazon does for the central part It carries off a body of water comparable to the Congo, and in its basin are found five of the most progressive countries of the continent which lies to the south of us. The estuary is 143 miles in width at its mouth; its shores are low; the currents are swift and the winds are strong. This makes the La Plata a dangerous river for navigation, though an immense business is done through the ports of Buenos Ayres and Montevideo, and ships of 4,000 tons can easily make their way 400 miles upstream. Smaller vessels ascend 1,000 miles and, at high water, still further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Three More Asiatic Streams</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Lena, length 2,770 miles, drainage area 960,000 square miles, parallels the Yenisei on the east as the Obi parallels it on the west, and is navigable throughout the greater part of its course in the summer season. It is believed that when the time cpmes for opening up this vast basin by railroads from the south and by Arctic steamship lines from the north it will be found to be a wheat-growing district like Northwestern Canada, capable of sustaining an immense number of people. At present, like all Siberia, it is largely uninhabited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Amur, 2,739 miles in length, drainage area 786,000 square miles, rises in about the same place as the Yenisei, in Asia, and fiows eastward, separating Manchuria from Siberia for a thousand miles of its length. It is handicapped by a bar at its mouth; but there are numerous steamers above the bar which bring their goods to Khabarovsk for transport the remainder of the distance by rail. The winters are severe; but the country is richly timbered, has an abundance of fish and fur-bearing animals and is admirably adapted to pasturage and agriculture. It lies in the same general latitude as Winnipeg, Calgary and the populous and growing Canadian Northwest When the climate moderates, as it will under the reign of the Prince of Life, there are millions who wifl prefer the snappy winter seasons to milder climates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hoangho, 2,600 miles in length, drainage area 200,000 square miles, is but 39 miles shorter than the Amur and is its nearest great neighbor op. the south, the rivers virtually paralleling one another. This great river is called China’s Sorrow, because in its time it has caused the death of millions of people. On one occasion when it was in flood, it carved a new course to the sea at a great distance from its original mouth. The river is broad and shallow, and unsuited to navigation. Its course is through an alluvial soil of unsurpassed fertility. The great plain, 700 miles long and about 300 miles wide, which constitutes its lower basin maintains a denser population than any other equivalent area of the earth’s surface. The river is crossed twice by the famous Chinese Wall</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Timbuctoo and the Niger</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230214_files/g_E_19230214-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Niger, length 2,500 miles, drainage area 584,000 square miles, is the great river of northwestern Africa, rises within 175 miles of the Atlantic Ocean and sweeps around a great semicircle back into the Atlantic. At the top of the immense circle, or rather we should say at the central point of the great arc described by the river’s course, in the center of a fertile prairie, lies Timbuctoo, destined, in the future, to be a rival of Chicago. Immense and fertile plains and forests stretch away to the east and west and south; and from this territory now come enormous supplies of oils, gums, ivory, and ostrich feathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Timbuctoo is at the head of navigation o£ the Niger, and a natural collecting and distributing depot for the products of the region. For generation the Arabs have carried the products northward to Tripoli, across the Sahara, making two round trips per year. Now the French are connecting Timbuctoo and Tripoli by rail, and the trip will be made in a few hours. Meantime a third of the goods are proceeding down the fifteen hundred miles of more or less dangerous navigation to the seaboard, where they constitute part of Britain’s valuable imports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Mackenzie and St. Lawrence</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Mackenzie, 2,300 miles long, drainage area 600,000 square miles, is the great river of Northwest Canada which, like the Obi, Yenisei, and Lena rivers of Siberia, flows northward into the Arctic Ocean and which can never become a great avenue of transportation from the seaward end until the Arctic Ocean warms up. At present it is navigable in its southern reaches and tributaries for about 2,000 miles. It is the most productive fur district in the world, and is believed to have vast petroleum deposits awaiting development. The central and southern portions will produce great crops when the growing season becomes a little longer, as it will under the new conditions about to come in earth’s affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The St. Lawrence river, drainage area 410,-000 square miles, of which the Canadians are so justly proud, comes next in length, with 2,200 miles, from its rise in Minnesota and its passage through the greatest fresh-water lakes on the globe to the gulf of St Lawrence at its end. This river is so well known to most of our readers thab-it needs little mention. Immediately below Lake Ontario are the Thousand Islands, a famous summer resort, resting upon its bosom. At present, the millions of people on both sides of the St Lawrence, and 500 miles back from its shores and from the shores of the Great Lakes through which it passes, are planning to have it made into a waterway that will take ocean-going ships direct from Chicago and Duluth to any ocean port in the world. The St Lawrence is famous for the clearness of its water and for the uniformity of its flow at all seasons. It has an extreme width of fifty miles at its mouth. Below Quebec for 250 miles the river proper has been drowned, as a distinct river channel 800 feet wide has been traced to the gulf and 100 miles into the gulf itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Volga and Obi</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Volga, 2,200 miles, the same length as the combined St. Lawrence and Great Lakes, and with a drainage area of 563,300 square miles, is the only European river which enters into our list of streams 2,000 or more miles in length. It is located in eastern Russia, and is navigable almost from its source to its mouth. The river abounds in fish of unusual size, and the banks are fertile and often well wooded. With its tributaries it affords about 7,000 miles of navigable waterways. An odd thing about this river, the greatest in Europe, is that it flows into ah inland sea which has no outlet — the Caspian Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The river next in size, the Obi, 2,120 miles long, drainage area 1,250,000 square miles, is an Asiatic stream and may be described as paralleling 4he course of the Yenisei. It is the great stream of Western Siberia as the Yenisei is the stream of Central Siberia. The place where it empties into the Arctic Ocean is near where the Yenisei empties; and when the Arctic becomes the general highway ol commerce about the northern portion of the earth, which it is bound some day to be, the valley of the Obi will be of great commercial importance. Geographers already predict that it will become one of the important food-producing regions of the world. It is navigable by large boats for a thousand miles, and with its branches has several thousand miles of navigable waterways for river craft. Those who imagine that the world is full of people had better look up some of these valleys and find out what a great place this world is.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Yukon, 2,044 miles in length, drainage area 200,000 square miles, is the great stream which rises in Western Canada and flows the entire length of Alaska westward into Bering Sea. In the three or four months in summer in which it is open, there is navigation for a distance of 1,866 miles. Indeed, it is the fifth river in the world in the length of navigable waters, being exceeded only by the Amazon, Mississippi, Missouri and St. Lawrence. There is already some gardening done in the valley of the Yukon, with an immense development sure to come within a century or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Indus, 2,000 miles long, drainage area 328,400 square miles, is the last one in our list We might go on and describe hundreds of other magnificent streams; but we must stop somewhere, and decide to make 2,000 miles the limit The Indus, the most westerly of the great rivers of India, sustains great losses through evaporation, irrigation and sinking into the sand, and on the whole its valley is not so fertile as the basin of most great riven in India and elsewhere. Nevertheless, millions of people find a livelihood upon its banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of this brief and elementary glance at the great river systems of the earth, and of the certain knowledge that there are hundreds of great systems which could not even be mentioned, how evident it is that the earth contains all the room Jehovah will need to make it the paradise for earth’s restored millions, which He has declared that it shall be in the “times of restitution.” With a little time, a fit-tie changing of the climate, the means are at hand to feed and to care for them as fast as they come back from the great prison-house </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oi.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> death which Christ is about to open.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">- Impressions of Britain—</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ANDING in Liverpool in the early evening, the American’s first objective is London, 192 miles away; and he is whirled away to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Lim</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e Street Station to get the midnight train. A glimpse from the taxicab window reveals the great difference between American street-cars, of double length and only one story in height, and the British tram-cars, as they are called, with a compartment downstairs for the ladies and accommodations upstairs for smokers. There are practically no one-story street-cars in Britain, and there are no two-story streetcars in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When the taxicab driver lands his passenger at the Lime Street Station, he seems to try to take advantage of the American’s unfamiliarity with British money; for he fails to give him the right change. A friendly Briton standing by reproves him and sees to it that the error is corrected. The driver protests that he thought that two of the two-shilling pieces which he had tendered as part of the change were half-crowns </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(2j</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> shilling pieces), but rectifies the error as the Briton insists that the matter be made right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Railroad Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RITISH railway stations are of many different designs, and all are quite different from those with which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ericans are most familiar. The usual style of American railway station is one large central waiting-room, brilliantly lighted and steam-heated; and within this one enclosure there are ticket offices, news stands, telephone booths, telegraph offices, toilet rooms, barber shops, information bureaus, restaurants, shoe-shining parlors, parcel rooms, and baggage departments, as well as the seats upon which one may wait for trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The usual style of British railway stations is the great iron and glass arched roof similar to the South Station in Boston, the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, and the old Broad Street Station in the same city, now in process of demolition. About twenty years ago these great arches went out of style in America, because they collect and retain the smoke from the locomotives, $nd in a few years become dark and dingy. With the advent of electric terminals, of which thele is none in England as yet, there is no need of such expensive and unsatisfactory structures; and in stations not yet fitted with electric approaches the train-sheds in America</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>-In Ten Parts </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{Part ni)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are of the sawtooth pattern,. with apertures over the stacks of the engines just sufficient in width to allow the smoke to escape without coming into the station at all The drainage of these sawtooth roofs is down the center of the columns supporting the same, and the net result is a clean and satisfactory train-shed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Within the great arched enclosure of the British railway station there is perhaps a score of detached buildings, serving the same purposes as in America, but all detached from one another, or frequently so detached. There axe a guards room, a first-class ladies room, a firstrdass gentleman’s room, first-class refreshment room, first-class booking hall, third-class booking hall, cloak room, parcels office, luggage room, toilet rooms, etc. Some of the toilet rooms are very fine, finished in white tile, as in America, and with features such as salesrooms for personal necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Arrangement of Platforms</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OME of the British stations are “open” stations, where any one who desires may go anywhere he pleases; and some are “closed” stations, where ingress and egress are by ticket. For a penny (2c) dropped into a slot machine any person may obtain a “platform ticket” and accompany his friend to the door of whatsoever train he wishes. In America friends are barred at the gates, and cannot get beyond them except by permission of the gatekeeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Lime Street Station, Liverpool, the train platforms are unusually wide and are so arranged that an automobile or other vehicle can drive right down the roadway in the middle of the platform and passengers may step from the cab almost directly into the door of the train. Quite a number of the stations in Great Britain are of this convenient type. There is no such arrangement anywhere in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Britain certain trains always come in on certain platforms. This is not always the case in America. In America, if a friend misses the incoming visitor, the usual custom is for them to meet at the news-stand in the general waiting-room. In Britain, if the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican does not see his friend waiting for him on the platform, he had better stay right on that platform and not go looking around for the news-stand unless he wishes to get lost and stay lost. That is what happened to your American in Sheffield. He tried using American brains in a Brit-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ish railway station, and it took him three hours to get found. Meantime his friend was in the same station, anxiously patrolling the right platform and wondering what had become of his peculiar charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In a &quot;closed” station there is no way out of the station except at a gate, where the railway ticket or platform ticket is surrendered. There is no such arrangement anywhere in America, where all tickets are taken up on the train by the conductor or by a ticket collector. Most tickets in Britain are collected at the barrier, on arrival at the station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">All stations in the British Isles are like the Grand Central Station in New York, or the Pennsylvania Station in the same city, and in North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, etc., in that the platforms are on a level with the railway-car floor and that the ears may therefore be entered .without ascending the four steps which are one of the abominations of American railway travel. As a result one cannot go from one part of a British station to another part without ascending and descending a flight of stairs, to carry him over or under the intervening tracks. But this is a good thing, however, for it prevents accidents. This form of platform is coming into more general use in America, and is without doubt the ultimate style. It would probably be adopted now all over America but for the enormous expense of equipping the cars and stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Billboards in Stations</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230214_files/g_E_19230214-3.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RITISH scenery is not disfigured by billboards (hoardings, as they are called) as in the United States; but they make up for it in their railway stations, which are disfigured from one end to the other with posters on every conceivable subject. The Britisher traveling in America would be as surprised to see all our landscape disfigured by billboards and to see the beauty and fte tidiness of our railway stations, as the American traveling in Britain is to see the stations such a blotch of Dosters and signs of all sorts and descriptions, and the beautiful landscapes as yet largely spared. On t^e whole the Briton has the better ' of it in this respect. If the traveler is to be tortured by having thrust before him everywhere he goes the ubiquitous Bovril, Dunlap’s &quot;Tyres,” Beecham’s Pills, Stafford’s Ink, Cartels Little Liver Pills, Ingersoll’s Radiolite,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Heinz 57, etc., it is far better to have the torture all in one place than to have it interjected everywhere between </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the landscape which he wishes to see. Most Americans think that Bovril is a great city, until they learn that it is a beef-tea extract</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Railway Passenger Can</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">LL railway-cars in American are entered from platforms at the ends. There are no outside doors anywhere except at the ends of the car, and the access to all parts of the car is by means of a -broad aisle extending usually down the center of the car. But in some special cars, such as dining-cars and certain types of sleeping-cars, a portion of the aisle may be at one side, to make more room for the dining-car kitchen or for the stateroom or staterooms of the sleeping-car. In Britain there are no platforms on the ends of the cars, and the cars are never entered except through the doors in the side. For the use of trainmen in the^ railway yards only, there are small running boards below the station platform levels, by means of which access to the car doors can be had in case of emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On trains which have only a run of fifty miles or so — and there are many such in Britain — there are no corridors running lengthwise of the train, and there is no way at all of going from one end of the train to the other. The aisles are crosswise of the train, with doors on each end and with a long seat on each side. There are windows in the doors, and two additional windows at each end of the compartment, making six windows in each compartment. The cars are 8| feet wide, feet narrower than American railway cars. On the long seats there is room for five passengers, or ten for a compartment The seats face each other, so that half of the passengers are riding with faces forward and half with faces to the rear. In five weeks’ experience there were seldom more than four in a compartment, and in numerous instances the compartment was occupied alone. There are no toilet occommoda* tions in this class of railway cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">These compartments are unsafe for women. Suppose two women are riding alone in a compartment The train stops and a man gets in; it stops again and one of the women gets out What is the other woman to do! IJTiat will be the outcome if it turns out that the man is * moron, a degenerate? Six bodies of English girls have been found alongside British railway tracks in the past six months, where they have been thrown by other occupants of their compartments; and there is no clue and no possible way of identifying the miscreant or telling from what compartment the victim was thrown. There is the bell-cord in the top of the compartment which may be pulled and the train stopped, if one could reach the bell-cord. But there is a penalty of five pounds for improperly pulling the cord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">British railway-cars are of various lengths, equipped with five, seven, eight or nine compartments. The shortest ones are but little more than half the length of the longest, which have nine compartments and are of the same length as the American cars. The shortest ears have three wheels on each side, one in the middle of the car, and look very odd to an American. The compartments are marked on the outside, to indicate whether they are first- or third-class, whether smoking, or non-smoking, or whether exclusively for ladies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The upholstery is luxurious high-back upholstery, of better quality in the British third-class cars than it is in the standard American day coach. The only difference between British first-class accommodations and third-class is that the upholstery of the first-class is still better and that the fare is about six cents per mile instead of about three cents for third-class. There are first- and third-class compartments in the same car. The seating capacity of a nine-compartment car is ninety passengers; the seating capacity of the standard </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican day coach is eighty passengers. American cars are two feet higher in the ceiling and are better heated and ventilated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the matter of heating, Americans overdo it and Britons underdo it. They are about 15° or 20° apart in their estimates of what makes for hum&amp;n comfort. The British sit in comfort in temperatures of 55°; and if it gets any hotter they open the windows. It is more often 75° in American railway-coaches than it is 70°; and if it were reduced to 68° the people would be better off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Britain^ there is nothing that compares with the elaborate, ornate, and luxurious Pullman chair-cars and sleeping-cars that traverse the American continent day and night in every direction. In these solid Pullman trains, some of which have continuous runs of over two thousand miles, one may live in the greatest luxury — have everything obtainable in a first-class hotel. Some of these trains not only have parlor-cars with swivel seats and observation-cars and reading-rooms with luxurious movable chairs, but barber shop, bath, ladies maid, valet, stenographer and typewriter, wireless concerts, telegraph operator, refrigerated air, and electric fans. Most Americans who make long trips use these trains.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>r</sup>PHE American sleeping-cars are transformed by day into handsome coaches in which every other seat faces the rear of the train. During the day the upper berths are locked up against the ceiling, with their load of mattresses, pillows, blankets, curtains, and partitions; but the curves are so graceful that one who knew nothing of the arrangement would go through the car admiring its graceful lines and without any idea of the great amount of sleeping equipment conveyed. At night, on each side of aisle, there are two sets of berths, upper lower, in each of which two passengers sleep with comfort. There are springs to upper berth; while the lower berth is comfortable, but not quite as resilient. In each end of American sleeping-cars there are elaborate toilet rooms; but the disappearing wash basins of British “lavatories” (as their toilet rooms are always called) are an improvement on the fixed basins of American cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In one end of most American sleeping-cars there is a “drawing-room,” a comfortable bedroom with accommodations for five persons, with its own private toilet room, everything of the very best that ingenuity can provide. The charges for a drawing-room are eight times the charge for a lower berth and the charge for an upper berth is eighty percent of the charge for a lower. The berths are fitted with hammocks for clothing, curtains to insure privacy, electric lights, call bells wherewith to summon the porter, mirrors, double windows for protection against the cold in winter, and copper screens for protection from cinders in summer. These items are given for the benefit of the foreign readers of The Golden Age, of whom there are many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">British </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sleeping-cars are made and used exclusively for night travel They are not con-' vertible into day coaches. The compartment system is followed in this, as in all other British trains, two berths to a compartment There are no upper berths. The beds are not so large as in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican cars, and the toilet accommodations are primitive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">RITISH trains are still lighted with gas; and some trains have felt hoods, which can be slipped over the globes to hide their glare; while electricity is now used exclusively on the better American roads. Some British dining-cars have an appearance almost similar to that of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Ame</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rican standard sleeping-cars when in use as coaches during the day; but in general the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican dining-cars are more elaborate than the British dining-cars, or have that appearance on account of the higher ceilings, larger windows, handsome movable diningchairs, and dainty electric lights on the tables. British dining-cars serve all meals table d’hote; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ericans </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">serve all meals &amp;&nbsp;la carte, so as to squeeze more out of the patron and give him less for his money. One can get a first-class meal on a British dining-car for one-half what it would cost </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> on an American dining-car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Up and down the platforms in the British stations go boys and girls with rolling buffets, from which there are served direct to the passengers who have already entered their compartments cakes, sandwiches, candies, and —what do you suppose!—TEA! In America, if they had such an arrangement, they would be Belling “hot dogs”—roasted frankfurters. The food is good, and the prices would make an </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican restaureteur turn over in his grave. A ham sandwich containing lots of real </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ham,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and a good cup of tea with milk and sugar. How much! Sixpence — 11J cents American money. How much bread, ham, tea and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and sugar do you suppose you would get in America for 11$ cents! ¥ou might go out and try it, and let The Golden Age know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The stations are so large that a stranger should allow </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">self plenty of time to wander around and find out where he belongs. The American had-an hour to wait at Newport He stepped up to a police officer and asked: “Could you please tell me where is the post office!” Back came the surprising but altogether logical answer, &quot;Outside.” And, sure enough! the whole town was not found under the station roof, and the post office was found to be just outside of it On the longer runs in Britain there are corridor trains, in which there are compartments the same as in all other trains, except that at one end these compartments open out into a corridor running the length of the car. On such cars there are toilet rooms or lavatories with a pleasing device on the doors which shows instantly whether the room is “Vacant” or “Engaged.” The locking or unlocking of the door throws into position a little sign just above the handle of the door, making it unnecessary to resort to the embarrassing expedient of trying the door. In each compartment of a British car there are five beautiful pictures of scenic points along the line of |he railway, and there is a mirror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There are no conductors on British tr</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aina, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and this sometimes leaves a stranger stranded. The American was bound from Leeds to Birmingham. He was in a rear car. The train got as far as Derby (pronounced Darby) where the front part of the train ran off to Birmingham (pronounced Brummagum); and it was not for three-quarters of an hour that the American discovered that he had been left</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">British trains do not wait for connections. The American, was bound from Bradford to Warrington. He changed cars at Huddersfield; his train was a minute or so late getting into the station, and the Manchester train had gone out on time. He waited half an hour, and got what looked like a through train for Warrington; but as the British do not number their trains (as is the universal custom in America) there is no means of determining from the time table whether the train which you board will do what you think it will do. Anyway, the train was a through train all right; but it went through Warrington at the rate of sixty miles an hour, without stopping. A British friend, who knew the ropes (and it is a delight to think of him), rescued the American at Manchester, and dragged him over to the local train, which followed the express only a minute or so afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">AY be you think that is an exaggeration, about the trains running as fast as sixty miles an hour. We give herewith a list of fourteen of the fastest British trains compiled by a British traveling man, confessedly done in a hurry. The American list was compiled by the American who was rescued at Manchester from the fast train, and is believed to be a nearly accurate selection of the fourteen very fastest all-the-year regular runs in the United States. People who think there many express trains in either country that have a scheduled run of over sixty miles per hour are due for a shock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">**The present world’s record was made by a mail train over this route, but we cannot give the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">British railway tickets show their cost upon their face — a very good plan, preventive of misunderstanding, and a great convenience to passengers who keep accounts of their expenditures. American roads should adopt the same practice. British time-tables have an excellent method of showing, numerically, the branch line connections. This feature should also be adopted by American railroads, and the British railways should resort to the American custom of numbering the trains, so that they can be identified by the passenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Country rambles or walking-tours are very popular with the British people. On any day in the year cheap tickets are sold, good to one </span><span class="font6">s’ntion, ai’d returning </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">from a different station pciaaps eight to ten miles distant. Out of Birmingham the Great Western advertises twentyeight such round trips, at an average cost of three shillings (67jc) for the round trip. If a dozen people wish to go to the city to see a prize fight or a ballet show, they can club together and get a special rate; but in some localities discrimination is made against parties that wish to go to town merely to attend a Bible lecture, and the special rates are withheld. This special rate is only for some kind of entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In America a passenger can take his baggage to the baggage-room, and by showing his ticket have it checked to any place in the United State*. He is given a claim check, which enables him on arrival at destination to have the baggage transferred to his home without the necessity of his looking after it- For all intents and purposes the baggage is checked direct from his hotel in Portland, Maine, or in Key West, Florida, to his home 4,000 miles away in San Diego, California, or in Bellingham, Washington. There is no snch arrangement in Britain. When the baggage-car comes to a stop, the baggage is piled ont on the platform, and the passenger goes forward and picks out what belongs to him. If somebody else gets there ahead of him and picks out the wrong baggage, somebody is the loser; but it does not happen. England is a Protestant country, and the people are honest. Nobody would think of taking ' .t did not belong to him; and this is one of the most charming traits of British character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There are practically no &quot;grade crossings” in Britain, and the trains can run at top speed without fear of running over anybody. In America the abolition of the grade crossings goes on slowly because of the great expense. And because there is no way by which cows could get upon the track the British locomotives have no “cow-catchers,” as the pilots on American engines are commonly called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Britisher Abhors Noise</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NSTEAD of a pilot in front of the engine there are bumpers, apparently arranged so that in case of an accident there would be a pneumatic cushion; for the Britisher has a penchant for doing things quietly that never seems to have occurred to the American. When the Britisher who has never been out of England is told that there are bells on American engines, he smiles incredulously and wonders what they could possibly be used for. He would be aghast if he could know that on some roads the bells are geared to the engine mechanism and ring monotonously all night long; and that besides, there are two long and two short toots of the whistle at every crossing in America, and the Crossings are a mile apart, so that the engine is tooting all night. There being no crossings in England, it is not necessary for the engine to toot; and it toots not</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Still another item of quietude is that the English engine attaches to the train so softly and starts so softly that the passenger is unconscious of it. This is sometimes the case in America, with the accent on the “some.” And sometimes the passenger gets a jerk or a bump that nearly throws him out of his seat The good old New Haven takes the palm for bumps and jerks, and the good old Lackawanna is (perhaps maliciously) said to take the palm for general all-around noise. One thing is sure and that is that when a trainload of fifty “battleships,” each holding fifty tons of coal, starts for the top of Mount Pocono with one “hog” engine on in front and four hog engines pushing, the dweller in Scranton can hear every snort of those engines three miles away; and the wheels screech on the rails so that they can be heard a like distance. The British engines are all encased, and present a much neater appearance than the American engines. They seem to be about two-thirds the size of the ordinary American engine or half the size of the Lackawanna “hog.” The latter engine is truly a colossal machine, with a boiler so long that the cab is located half-way up its length. Its coal capacity is ten tons and its water capacity 8,000 gallons; and even the Lackawanna “hog” is small beside some of the special “Mountain Climbers&quot; and oil burners built for other roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">British engine have no cabs; the engineer has to stand at his work. British engines have no headlights in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican sense of the term. They merely use what look like ordinary handlanterns. There are places in America where the headlight of an oncoming engine can be seen sixty miles away. One of these places is on the New York Central Railroad between Toledo and Kendallville, Indiana, where there is the longest piece of perfectly straight trade in the world — 77 miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freight Can</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> vs. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Goods Wagons</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NE of the most interesting things to an American in Britain is the method of transporting freight The American standard freight car is 12 feet 5| inches high, 10 feet 2 inches wide, 8 feet high inside and 35 feet inches long inside or about 40 feet over all. It has a rated carrying capacity of 100,000 pounds, or 50 tons. Furniture and automobile cars are 60 feet long. There is nothing of this kind in Britain, where the term freight car is not known. To take its place there are goods wagons, which are really wagons, with spokes in the wheels. In America all car-wheels are solid. The British goods wagon is apparently about twelve feet long over all, and between nine and ten feet in height. It has four wheels, one on each corner, and a rated capacity of ten tons. To an American these cars look like playthings; and it is probably the amusement of Americans at the smallness of these cars that has caused many Americans to be disliked in Britain. These goods wagons have old-style hand brakes, bumpers and chains — no airbrakes or automatic couplers as in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It does not follow, however, that because a thing is small it is undesirable. There are advantages in having small freight cars, even if there are larger advantages in having larger ones. Every manufacturing concern in Britain, and every mining concern apparently, has its own cars; for there is the greatest possible variety in name, and this enables the concern to do business direct with its customers, a great advantage. Moreover, this distribution of small cars tends to keep business distributed instead of centralized in the hands of a few great magnates. Again, a customer can afford to buy in carload lots; whereas in America only those who are financially great can undertake the responsibilities. The little British flat-cars look as if they would have difficulty in handling one scoopful from a steam-shovel, but apparently the steam-shovel is a stranger to Britain. None were seen in a five weeks tour, whereas in America one could not take a five-day tour without seeing several.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">One interesting and practical method of freight delivery was witnessed, caring for the daily interchange of products between Belfast, Ireland, and London. A truckload of goods came to the pier at the last moment. Its contents were in four great boxes mounted on wheels. The boxes were slid out of the truck, and run up the gangplank on their own wheels. The next morning, at Fleetwood, on the eastern side of the Irish Sea, they were again run on their own wheels into the train which transported them to London — a quick, efficient, economical method. America is now giving attention to this very problem — efficient handling of less-than-carload freight. On August 1,1922, British railroads announced a reduction of twenty-five percent of the war increase, affecting every class of goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In American railway stations, on account of the platform being three or four feet below the level of the floor of the car, mail, express and baggage are loaded to and from the car by means of trucks, the platforms of which are just level with the floor of the car. From these hand trucks the articles are loaded to and from the street trucks, which are the same height. This prevents unnecessary lifting of the packages. This cannot be done in a British railway station. Everything is piled out on the platform of the station and must be lifted to the waiting vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The United Kingdom, as the British Isles are officially called, has eighteen railway companies, with mileages ranging front 795 to 8,077. There are 24,000 miles of railway open for traffic; but on account of the fact that almost every mile is double-tracked or quadruple-tracked, the total mileage is 55,000 miles. The four greatest systems are the London and Northwestern, with its 8,077 miles, covering the territory from London and Birmingham north and west to Glasgow; the Great Western, covering the territory from London and Birmingham west and south to the English Channel; the North Eastern, covering the territory from Edinburgh south along the eastern shore; and the Midland which, as its name implies, traverses the heart of Britain from London northward to the termini in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a general arrangement in England for the transportation of baggage to the amount of 28 pounds from the station to any point in the city of destination for a cartage charge of sixpence, HJe. If the trunk weighs not more than 112 pounds, the charge is one shilling, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22}</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> c. In Scranton the baggage burglars will not take a trunk anywhere for less than a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The British roadbeds or rights of way are far better than in America. The rails are carried on chairs securely bolted to the crossties and held in place by wooden wedges, which are driven up every morning by the trackwalker. These chairs in a modified form are coming into use in America. The sides of all the cuts are covered with grass and the climate has made it impossible that they should be otherwise. In the cuts, about ten feet apart, are strips of crushed rock about four feet wide, the object of which is to furnish natural carriage for the storm water, so that the sod will remain intact. There is almost no concrete; the bridges are of brick and very graceful in appearance. A few concrete section houses are seen. &quot;Wires of all sorts are underground. In </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erica they are carried on unsightly pole* and crossarms beside the right of way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HRISTMAS with its excitement is now upon us. The Christmas shopping trade, which at the time of last writing was reported dull, has now livened up; and apparently a great deal of money is being spent. However, it is still reported that the shops in the poorer district are finding their trade in groceries and fruits not so good. Perhaps this means that the volume of trade is not as much as the shopkeepers want; but there is no question that the poor are poorer than they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Published statistics show that the miners are really badly off. The standard wage is considerably better (on paper) than it was; but owning to slackness of trade, and the higher cost of living, the miner with all his arduous and dangerous work is, if anything, worse off than he was in the hard days before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Labor Party has been making itself heard in the House of Commons. Some of its members have been making noisy and &quot;rude” interjections — exhibitions of bad </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mann</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ers, according to the opinions of those who would like to be thought their betters. But one of their number, who has had many years Parliamentary experience, retorts that these interruptions are not nearly so rude, or noisy, or violent as those of the young bloods of the Tory Party, the gentlemanly party, when Mr. Asquith introduced his Home Rule Bill. Without doubt the Labor members, particularly those from Scotland, intend to assert themselves in Parliament. The leader, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, will have some difficulty in restraining some of the members of his party.’ Mr. MacDonald is a man of considerable experience and much restraint; and a man of considerable personality and force of character; one who will have to be reckoned with in any council of state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The hunger marchers are still in London; their numbers have been lessened from various causes, but are being augmented by others who are on the road to London. There is a suspicion abroad that the police are taking measure^ against them more worthy of the old Russian methods than those usually associated with British government In other words that they are to seme extent acting as provocative agents. The leaders of the Labor Party do not associate themselves with this movement and probably it will fail to produce anything really helpful to themselves. It will do this, however,, it will make the country realize that there is a depth of poverty, and misery, and suffering existent which the middle-class and well-to-do would gladly have kept from their notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On December 11th the registered number of unemployed was 1,388,600, or 435,133 less than the beginning of last January. One of the relieving officers in the city of Birmingham says there is much suffering amongst the unemployed, and he knows many of that city who have not tasted meat for twelve months. The Board of Trade figures for November show increases in trade. Two large battleships are being built, and there is a slight upward movement in the steel trade. These things give a little hope of improvement in the general situation, but it is too slow and insufficient to be of real help. In the meantime neither the government, nor the Labor Party, nor the churches have anything to say that promises to relieve the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The farmers are making complaint of getting poor payment for their labor and produce. A cutting from a recent daily paper is enclosed showing where a farmer states that for two tons of turnips grown and sent to market he has had a loss of eight shilling and three pence. The railway company benefits, the commission agent gets his cost, and the farmer pays up for the privilege of growing his produce. However, it ought to be said that a little while back when prices were up, and the farmers were getting value beyond what was right, they did not then write to the papers making complaint</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reports from Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE entire population of Germany is being gradually weakened, since it is nearly impossible to buy the most necessary things on account of the enormous rise of prices. The little children with pale faces, and the condition of the adult people of the country, the terrifying statements by the sick-fund organizations, and the endless obituary notices in the newspapers are plain proof of a systematically organized policy of strangulation of an entire people by the claws of a great monster, Selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The associated body of German physicians has issued a short statement, an appeal to the entire world, crying for help. This call is taken up by the entire German press, and throws an interesting sidelight on the situation. The statement, printed in a Berlin paper, reads as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>W</sup>ZHS DISTRESS or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">TTTTt</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> GERMAN TS0PL2 — A QALL VOX HELP BY THE PHYSICIANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Berlin, December 15: The associated body of German physicians made a demonstration at the university of Berlin against the increasing distress of the German people. The following resolution was unanimously adopted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">““The associated body of German physicians deems it its duty, emphatically to call attention to the great dangers that are threatening the German people on account of the continually increasing distress. Bad nutrition, the housing calamity, shortage of coal, the impossibility of taking proper care of the body, sorrows and privation of every kind not only diminish the productive powers of the people, but also their power of resistance against disease in a most alarming manner. The consequences are now apparent and soon will become more evident, especially in the case of children and younger people. Tuberculosis is on the increase, rachitis and anemia are widespreading, scorbutics and deaths from hunger are no exceptions any longer. We appeal to our colleagues in foreign countries, we appeal to the entire world civilization, to look at the situation with clear eyes, not to be blinded by the conduct of life of a small crowd of pleasure seekers. The distress is already widespread. Charity on a small male cannot accomplish essential changes any more. The entire desperate economical condition requires a fundamental change. We call upon the world to make this possible for us.*”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The angel of death hovers over this country; and how long will it be that the people living in it will experience the same sad state that Russia is in? Yet in Germany everyone is certain of this, that if on account of the inflexible attitude of France, the unbearable burdens of the army of occupation and of the reparation payments are not made lighter, Germany will open its doors to the pressure of a multitude standing in the north. It does not appear to us very doubtful, that the remarkable words of Jeremiah in the 6th chapter, verses 22 to 24, would be fulfilled by such an act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Also I set watchmen over you, saying, . Hearken to ^he sound of the trumpet But they said, We will not hearken. . . . Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.”—Jeremiah 6:17, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">No one knows a way out of all these troubles. Only the Messianic kingdom can bring the desired help for the hard-pressed world, and also for this hard-pressed country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reports from Switzerland</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE are, in every station and profession, thinking men who watch with deep anxiety the conditions developing in Europe. Leading papers in neutral states have often addressed their readers with important words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The principal newspaper of Switzerland, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bund,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is practically read all over the world, published in a leading article for Easter 1921 the following statement of the European conditions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“We are not only very far from peace, which we need </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">k&gt;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> much, but we are also in the midst of a chaos of hatred, violence, discord, revolution, strife and other dismal things. The clouds which chase on the political horizon are far from springtime clouds, but sultry, threatening, heavy, harmful clouds. The news which comes to us over land and sea has alas! no likeness of the dove that brought the olive-branch; on the contrary, it is more like a raven, the blackcoated messenger of evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">How very appropriate were these words nearly two years ago! But what do we see today? Have these dark clouds cleared the political and economical horizon? Have the sinister clouds cleared away? Every reader of The Golden Age knows well that this is not the case. What happened in Europe since then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When the words above mentioned were written, Lloyd George was still the leading genius of Europe. He was anxiously striving to gain his French colleague Briand for his own plans. He almost succeeded, but the wet blanket Poincare came between them and caused the conference at Cannes to fail. Briand became dangerous; he was too yielding and therefore had to be dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor deceived humanity, of which a newspaper correspondent of Cannes so appropriately said that they had hoped the savior of the world would be born at Cannes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Genoa Lloyd George wanted to lay the foundation for peace. He said there in part that we ought first to understand one another and that the other things would follow of themselves. The great economic machine had gone to pieces, and had first to be put together again. The wise Lloyd George stated further that economic relations with Russia ought to be taken up again. Trusting, of course, that Lloyd George must know it all, the optimists transferred their hopes to Genoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Germany, however, people had become quite sceptical “Geh nu a (b)” was the expression there. But being invited, they went to Genoa, hoping against all hope. But Lloyd George made his calculations without the wicked Tschitcherin. Even Poincare was an angel as compared with him! They tried with this “enfant terrible&quot; kind words and severe words; but everything failed, and the hope of an economic resurrection of Europe came to nothing. Lloyd George had only made a little (!) mistake ; he had forgotten that Russia was at her last breath, and that there is no possibility of any commercial treaty with the starving millions of a nation, who are tyrannized by a “camarilla,” the wickedest of the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore it was logical that the conference at Genoa was a complete failure, not to speak of the differences between Englishmen and Frenchmen, and of the special ambitions of the other participants. Some said the conference smelt of petroleum, because of the very evident jealousy of the parties concerning it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Where the great question comes in, How to save Europe from disaster, there the men in power quarrel about petroleum, like schoolboys over roasted chestnuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What a hopeless picture I Does any European wonder why Uncle Sam does not wish to come to the rescue of such a Europe!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">After that came the Turks creating new and great difficulties, and the European leaders had, beside thousands of their own home difficulties, to trouble themselves with the Oriental situation. Lloyd George himself fell a victim to Turkish politics, and with him the world lost the cleverest politician, who had initiative to prevent disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Iq Poland the blackest reaction reigns, and of republican spirit little or none is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Italy the Bolshevists of the extreme right (Fascists) were victorious, and this will surely lead in a very short time to a reaction towards the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Austria is on the verge of State bankruptcy, and now tome the other European states to throw a few more milliards into the Austrian crater. But even this financial aid was not able to lift the Austrian krone as much as one centime per 100 kronen. How much would it need to raise it as high as one, or even as high as 100 kronen per 100 francs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime the German mark falls lower and lower, and Germany also calls for financial help of at least 500,000,000 goldmarks to save herself. This is that very Germany which is supposed to pay and to repair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The most desperate efforts are being made to keep the French and Belgian franc from falling. Press campaigns have been organized in order to strengthen confidence in the franc. But slowly and incessantly do these values fall to the point of zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Western powers realize the German insolvency very well The inter-allied finance commission had it proved to them at Berlin. But they dare not and will not confess it; for they would thereby acknowledge their own failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The theory of mortgage of Mr. Poincarl will not be able to change anything, because if France would occupy the whole of the Rhine and of the Ruhr, it would only cause French and Belgian money to fall more quickly, and to land Germany into complete bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">•Beyond the German frontier there is a crafty and evil enemy lurking, whose seed only blossoms where there are calamity and misery, disorder and dissolution, and he does not hide his purpose; he is waiting for the favorable moment to hurl all of Europe into anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This is the political horizon for the coming year. More disastrous, more dark, more helpless then ever, the future stares us in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thinking men of all countries and positions cry terror-stricken for a second Caesar or Napoleon who might be able to take the lead. Is there no organization, no group of men, nothing at all in the whole world able to bring help! And lo, and behold, there is no one at all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Darkness and hopelessness reign over Europe, and should not a higher One seize the reins of the government and intervene, all Europe will go with terriffic speed into anarchy, rope will go with terrific speed into anarchy. Oh, that men were wise, that they would apply their hearts to understand the work and plan of the Lord I Then would the present kingdoms ‘ melt down gradually. Reform would swiftly follow reform, and liberty follow liberty and justice and truth would prevail until righteousness would be established in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Ku Klux Klan has invaded New England with a rush and a bang. Started things right in the heart of the enemy’s country, the north end of Cambridge, commonly known as Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At an open mass meeting, held at Odd Fellows Hall, Massachusetts Ave. and Walden St., North Cambridge, the Klan threw its banner to the breeze last Tuesday evening, bidding defiance to all who opposed it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The temporary chairman was Telfair Min-turn, Secretary of the Loyal Coalition, who introduced F. Eugene Farnsworth of Boston, a former newspaper man, as the permanent chairman. Mr. Farnsworth stated that he was neither a Klansman nor a Mason, but that he was a Methodist and was proud of it. He also stated that he was informed that in Maine, his native state, there were forty thousand Masons, many of whom were afraid or ashamed to wear their Masonic emblems where they could be seen; and he asked why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The stage was decorated with a magnificent United States flag, seated in front of which were several members of the Klan, dressed in long white robes with white hoods and masks over their heads and faces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The meeting was opened with prayer by one of the white-robed Klanmen. The audience, about a thousand men and women, mostly men, stood and sung the Star Spangled Banner, being led by a Mrs. Bradley, who rendered the national anthem in a pleasing voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. William J. Mahoney, the National Lecturer, was introduced by the chairman about nine o’clock, and spoke with great earnestness for over an hour. Dr. Mahoney is a Baptist Minister from Richmond, Va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker launched immediately into the heart of his subject by upbraiding the newspapers that had attacked the Klan, paying especial attention to the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Hearst papers, and the Boston </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Telegram.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> He stated that arrangements had already been made to have a press that would be fair to the Klan, anchthat those who would not be fair would be compelled by the numbers of the membership to state the facts as they exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker threw down the gauntlet to the</span></p>

D. Bulman, which will</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Klan’s opponents, and stated that no organization ever had purer motives or higher ideals than theirs. He denied that they were opposed to either the Negro, the Jew, or the Boman Catholic as citizens of this country, but that these were denied membership in the Klan by the same circumstances that denied them membership in other organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Negro was denied membership in the Klan, according to Dr. Mahoney, because it was essentially a white man’s organization, with the express object of keeping the white and negro races absolutely separate from each other. The Jew was barred because he could not subscribe to the tenets of the Christian religion, and the order is decidedly a Christian one. The Roman Catholic is excluded because he would not be allowed by his church to become allied with a Protestant organization, and the Klan is a pro-Protestant order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He cited the fact that a Jew could not become a member of the Knights Templars for the same reason, neither could a Protestant become a member of the Knights of Columbus because the ritual of that order especially specified that none were eligible save practical Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The speaker paid especial attention to the attitude of Arthur D. Prince, Grand Master of the Masonic Fraternity for the State of Massachusetts, who issued a public statement a few weeks ago condemning the Klan. He denied that there was any official connection between the Masons and the Klan, but stated that all of the national officers of the Ku Klux </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Klan</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, with the exception of three, were members of the Masonic Fraternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The following is an open letter addressed to Arthur D. Prince:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Ma. Abthub D. Pbutob,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lowell, Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dear Mr. Prince:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A copy of your letter to the Worshipful Masters of Masonic lodges in Massachusetts has fallen into my hands. With your edicts and your messages to Masonic bodies in your own state I have nothing to do. But when you maliciously attack an outstanding organization that stands for the highest patriotic and Christian ideals as does the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan it becomes my duty as a Supreme Officer of this organization to give your unwarranted attack my personal attention.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SM</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let me say in the beginning of this letter that I offer no apology for addressing this communication to you. My Masonic connection gives me this right It so happens that I am a Mason, a Knight Templar, a Thirty-second-Degree Mason; and I hold an honorary rank in the Southern Jurisdiction. I also frankly say that I glory in my relationship with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and I find through my connections with this order an opportunity to render a nation-wide service in promulgating the principles of real Americanism and of Protestant Christianity. As a Protestant Minister who has served for more than twenty-four years and who has enjoyed distinctions and received honors during this period of service, I frankly say to you that I have suffered no loss of caste by entering into the large field of service that my present connections afford me. Taking your statements as they appear in your letter, I want to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1st. That the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are in hearty sympathy with your statement that “every member of this Fraternity knows that one of the great fundamentals of Freemasonry is obedience and respect for the majesty of the law.” You seem not to know this very principle is one of the fundamentals of this Order, but it was easy to you to have gained this information had you so desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">2nd. I want to say to you that you are no more zealous for other Constitutional principles than are the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan; for we stand absolutely behind the Constitution of the United States, pledged to uphold it and to see that its principles and ideals shall thrive in this America of ours. Our very literature tells you that we are zealous for the liberties of our American people and that we stand for the Constituted authorities, upholding their hands when they call upon us for such service; that'we contend absolutely for freedom of worship, liberty of conscience, freedom of speech and press, and for all those liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, which is the highest law of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3rd. I note that you have learned that “the objects of the Klan are political, sectarian and racial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I can easily detect the sources of your knowledge. An interested and enslaved press has freely proclaimed these falsehoods to the world during the past several months. The surprising thing to me is that your Masonic relationships have failed to teach you the value of suspended judgment until you are possessed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">all facts. You have unmasonically prejudged us before addressing yourself to the task of securing accurate information about us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This order declares emphatically that it is not political, and I affirm that its claims are just as true as are the claims of Masonry to be non-politicah You say we are sectarian. I shall be very glad if you will indicate the sect the Klan is supporting. I have mingled freely with men of all Protestant organizations who are in this order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As to your charge that we are racial, may I ask what sin we commit in seeking to advance the interests of the White Race, in seeking to maintain the purity of the White Man's blood, and in seeking to defend our precious White Heritage f As a white man, as a member of a White Man’s organization, I offer no apology for this principle. I am amazed, however, that any man having a white skin should condemn an organization composed of white men for their pride of race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">4th. I note your statement that the officers and organizers of this order have claimed “that its membership is largely Masonic, and that it has Masonry’s approval and support.” As to the first part of this statement, I can say truly that a large number of real honest, true, well-grown Masons hold membership in this Order, but no official declaration of this kind has ever gone forth from the National Headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan. As to the second part of this statement, “It has Masonic approval and support,” I am saying emphatically that no statement of this kind has ever been made by the officials of this organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As an Order we are not seeking approval and support of any Order. If we cannot stand on our own feet and win through the principles we cherish and teach, we have no right to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I am aware of the fact that some Grand Masters have been issuing edicts warning their members against the Klan under penalty of Masonic Discipline. These other Grand Maa-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ters</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> are as guilty of speaking through prejudice, due to lack of information, as are you, and it seems to me that they have as much authority to forbid their members joining a Protestant church, the Odd Fellows or any of the political parties, as they have to forbid them to join this Order. The Ku Klux </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Klan</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> <sub>r </sub>has neither disposition nor desire to ride through on Masonry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">5th. Your statement, &quot;That it violates Masonic principles at every point” leads me, as a Mason, to call upon you for the proof to sustain this charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">6th. I note that you have fallen in line with the Catholic, Jewish, Negro and other class journals in denouncing this Order as “an organization which advocates taking the law in its own hands, condemning men and women in secret trials and imposing the punishments of the whip, the tarbucket or unlawful banishments.” My reply to this is, that whether this statement be original with you, or borrowed by you, it is maliciously and utterly false. I am enclosing a document that I am issuing to Klansmen throughout the nation, and if you will refer to the third section, the third paragraph of this document, you will find our official declaration which I think will cover the ground for you. If this be lawlessness or if it teach any such thing as you charge, I am unable to interpret ideas or to understand simple language. I am also enclosing a copy of a letter written in reply to a Presbyterian preacher, and I ask that you will give this document a fair and impartial reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I am willing to come to Boston or any other part of Massachusetts and let you state publicly your objections to this Order and follow with my statement, leaving the result of the issue to the fair-minded men of your state; not that I would engage in anything but a high-class discussion of the questions involved. I am sure that it will require only fair investigation on the part of men who are disposed to be fairminded to lead them to accept at face value the statements of men who are just as honest and as honorable as they.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I shall be glad to answer any questions you may desire to ask me, and I assure you that my answers will be made in the fairest and most fraternal spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">William J. Mahoney, Imperial Klokard (Supreme Lecturer) 801 Flatiron Bldg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As an aftermath of the Klansman’s public meeting, many prominent men both Catholio and Protestant have been interviewed by representatives of the Press, and the majority of them, as well as those of the Hebrew faith, appear to view the affair as a huge joke. They seem to take the advent of the Ku Klux Klan in our midst very good naturedly, and do not appear to be very much worked up over their presence here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The fact remains, however, and cannot be denied, that the organization is in New England. It is growing with a great deal of rapidity, and, judging from the vociferous applause that was indulged in by the six hundred or more people gathered in Odd Fellows Hall, North Cambridge, last Tuesday evening, the sentiments of the Klan as expressed by the Supreme Lecturer, Dr. Mahoney, met with their approval</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Degenerate Press </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By S. c. De Oroot</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;VT EWSPAPERDOM is a peculiar business</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">’ indeed. This, one of the greatest and most valuable educational channels in the world, has become the clearing house for political, religious and financial schemes. Schemes, because the manufabturer, politician, preacher, financier, promoter, or lobbyist, after carefully preparing his ideas for his own advancement either in dollars and cents, or, as is often the case, in popularity or outward “show,” foists his intrigues by wily methods upon the “press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The ideal of the newspaper, great or small, is as summed up by Joseph Pulitzer, when he purchased the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Mr. Pulitzer announced through one of his editorials these ideals — ideals, because the distinguished editor, as well as all other editors of the metropolitan newspapers, has merely held these before the public, as a teacher holds a sample of penmanship before her pupils, well knowing that even herself could not come nigh the ideal. Mr. Pulitzer said his paper was to ba:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“An institution that should always fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, always fight demagogues </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> all parties, never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and publie plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What an ideal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If such a standard could be carried out by the newspapers, the world would be in the throes of a bloodless revolution! People, yes, all of them, would follow the good example set by their honored editors. Privileged classes would see that they were being opposed by newspaperdom; their schemes to entrap the innocent would not find expression in the journal columns; they would no longer have direct and effective newspaper advertisements and news items to laud their seemingly righteous purposes. The result would be a cessation of their propaganda, and a slide back to their proper niche in world affairs, and a brighter prospect for human contentment, happiness, and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But notice carefully, during the next few weeks, the attitude of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> newspaper, as well as that of others with which you come in contact; and you will be astounded when you see the party favoritism. You will see how these editors have played either willingly or unwillingly into the hands of big business, big politics, and big religious leaders. Many editors of high personal character, men who would gladly be free from the power of big business, big politics, and big religionists, long for the day when they can run their papers as they please. We will now point out </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> editors and many others connected with the editing of the newspaper are not in a position to run their own paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The first reason is that big business has carefully arranged to advance money, and has thereby assumed a controlling interest in our greatest papers. Many an editor who is noted for his good arrangement of news, his good selection of correspondents, his well-connected editorials, his exceptional foresight of national and international affairs, has risen from the common walks of life. By close observation and active personal experience with men in all walks of life he has prepared himself for the position of editor, or pubtisher, of a larger paper; but he finds that he has no money. Ab a reporter or as the owner of a small paper he has accumulated but little. Therefore with his capabilities, his career before him and with his rather large ambitions, he takes big business into partnership with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">; or, as is really the situation, they take him into partnership with them. From that time onward he is tied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is an open claim of the big business boosters that they have the public press, the politician, and the clergyman; further that they can depend on these three channels to champion their cause; and now it is generally understood that the influence of big business begins in the kindergarten and general schoolroom. It is manifest that these claims are correct. The common man’s cause finds little expression in the newspaper columns. If the poor man is overcome by a fault and is brought before the bar of justice, everyone knows that he finds but little friendship and, in many cases, no justice. But how many times we read an account of brutal murder on the part of “society” folk, yet our newspapers present the matter in such a light as to pave the way for freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The common people are no longer like the new-born kitten; now they have their eyes Open. They see where they have been fooled and deceived. They see how that millions of their brothers and sons entered the World War, sacrificed their positions, their vitality, and their health. They see likewise that during the World War they were urged to give more and even more to battle the enemy, and that the nations were bonding themselves beyond limit to carry on the fight for democracy. They now see the other side. Thousands of soldiers were disappointed when they returned from the war. The glory which they expected was to get the old job back. Honor they cared not for so much, but just food and a home for their loved ones. They were disappointed. We can all see that the soldiers’ bonus has been fought by most of the leading papers. The papers are for the politician; and the politician is usually for his friend — big business, and big business is for everything but little business or the common man who earns his money for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The business of a newspaper is that of a large mirror which reflects the events that transpire from day to day. The small village newspaper would thus reflect the events of the entire community. The larger newspapers serving the cities and the rural districts are supposed to reflect perfectly the state, national, and foreign news, as well as that of the community. There are now machines similar to a typewriter, furnished with a roll of paper about three inches wide, which takes down the news automatically; that is, without the attention of an operator. These machines receive news from the Associated Press, the United Press, etc., which gather news from all the world and disseminate it all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But strange to say, although almost every thing is reported through these agencies, many items of real interest to the people are eliminated— undoubtedly to please certain classes. As an illustration of what I mean and to assist in understanding this peculiar newspaper question I call your attention to the way the public press blacklisted hundreds of good, well-meaning people, some of whom were Christian men, because they would not cooperate in what is now generally admitted to be the &quot;twentieth century blunder,” the World War. Honest men were branded as traitors, pro-German, spies, etc., In almost every instance these men were regarded as very good citizens by their fellowworkers and neighbors, but the news despatches vividly pictured these conscientious objectors as frenzied demons. Such men were usually held a few days, or weeks, or months; and then because no wrong thing could be found against them they were released. Did the newspapers give the same space to clear them of the blot against their reputations? Surely not, because to do so would be to turn their backs on their staunch supporters, the preachers, and big business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The general policy and principles of any newspaper are to be found in the editorial writings. Therefore if you want to get more real good from the reading of your newspaper be sure to read, or at least to glance over, the editorial page. There you will see the announced stand that this particular paper takes on the questions of the day. All articles in the paper bearing on such questions or topics must be more or less in harmony with the policy announced in'the editorials. Further, by reading the editorials you are enabled to take many of the articles in the paper with “a grain of salt”; or you can detect throughout the paper, articles that are merely fostering the general attitude of the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As an illustration of what is meant you have probably noticed articles on Henry Ford’s Muscle Shoals proposition. If you carefully notice you will see that at some time or other the editor has inserted his personal view of the “proposition” in the editorial comments. It is usually found that when he has manifested his disapproval of the project, the articles are more or less a one-sided presentation of the matter. The same was illustrated in the fight concerning the church school amendment in Michigan two years ago. The amendment sought to rid the state of these schools and to require all children of school age to attend the public schools. Newspapers did not print all the news regarding the issue, but those that favored the measure printed elucidating articles or news items that would finally insure its adoption; and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The editors receive many items that never appear in the paper; these are consigned to the “hell box.” Other articles that deal with certain men and institutions are placed in the “morgue,” so that if for any reason such an individual should suddenly die, or if as during the war a large battleship was sunk, they would at once by resorting to the “morgue” find the necessary material to make a quick and complete account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The larger papers hold editorial councils in which the policy of the paper is decided upon. It is considered as not at all dishonest for an editorial writer to vent views that he truthfully does not believe in. This he does because he is under control of the owners of the company, who may have differing views from his. Large papers having several editorial writers often first call for a volunteer to handle the subject, and in this way usually get one who believes in the policy of the paper on the point under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The “cartoon” is considered as an unwritten editorial In a cartoon we have an appealing method of swerving public opinion. The recent railroad strike furnishes an illustration. If the policy is for the railroad magnate and capitalism in general a cartoon might appear representing “labor” as standing on an exalted position with a threatening rod in his hand, picturing in the background innocent women and children who are deprived of food and coal by their supposedly autocratic position. Such a cartoon without a written word vividly impresses the policy of that paper on the railroad strike question. On the other hand a &quot;labor” paper would exhibit a cartoon picturing &quot;capital” as a giant, with meanness in his face, illustrating possible numerous dollar signs in the background, holding in one hand a pack of bills and in the other several slips of paper reading press, church, brains, statesman, etc.; and he might be pictured as saying, “By these I win.” These unwritten lessons are recognized</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as of such tremendous value that first-page space is often given them. Many newspaper* have been sued in the courts because of a “simple” cartoon. With all these things in view we ■ should be able properly to read our newspapers so as to sift the &quot;rot” and glean the real good. In the incoming Golden Age the newspaper will go through the same process as our modern dictionary—most of it will have to be cut out. ' . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE authority of the United States census, it is stated that one-half of the American people are renters. This means that they are homeless, and live from hand to mouth. It means that they are transient, nomadic, moving from place to place in search of a livelihood. Of the other half, who have deeded homes, a large percent of the homes are mortgaged beyond recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A thirty-thousand dollar farm, rented out on the halves, is reported to have made about four hundred and twenty dollars each for owner and tenant. The taxes amounted to one hundred and twenty dollars. It may be readily seen that four hundred and twenty dollars would dwindle away in repairs, seeds, tools, etc. If an automobile has been bought on credit — as most of them are — and dues met, what has the fanner or renter left to live on! Nothing but a little credit, we may be sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Golden Age, now succeeding the world’s dark ages, there will be no homeless renters. None will be permitted to fence in or claim by title millions of acres to lie out as hunting grounds or pleasure resorts or to be half tilled. Great corporation and their monopoly of all will cease. Glad we are for the new day, though it comes in blood and thunder. “They shall build houses and inhabit them.” “They shall not build and another inhabit” “The earth shall blossom as the rose,” and “her wilderness become like the garden of Eden.”</span></p>

Under the circumstances I wish to retract that article, as I do not wish to be a party to an injustice to anybody.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>American Cruety Hard to Understand</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEVOLENT men, not to say Christian men, the world over, are marveling at the harshness of the United States Government toward its own citizens. At the end of September last there were still seventy-five political prisoners held in jail, under the monstrous Espionage Act restricting freedom of speech; and their sentences still aggregated 800 years of suffering,' though the law was suspended March 3, 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Captain Robt. Fay, who was caught attempting to blow up munition ships in New York Harbor in 1916, and who subsequently broke jail and was at large for a year before recapture, has been released. Fay was slipped out of the country by the “authorities,” though ne announcement was given to the press that the President had commuted his sentence. Fay is a charming gentleman to meet, and he had all kinds of money back of him. It is astonishing what money will do in this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age calls attention to the fact that the seventy-five men who are to be punished for an aggregate eight hundred years have already served several hundred in the aggregate; that they are mostly American citizens ; that not one of them was accused of German sympathies; and that they were impris</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">oned because of their spoken or written opposition to war on humanitarian grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Fay, the German spy and dynamiter, was set free just at the time that the White House and the Department of Justice were telling inquirers that in.view of the country’s industrial troubles there was no time to take up any of the political cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">While the President had time to sign the papers freeing Fay, the review of the case of John Pancner of Detroit, political prisoner, had been before him for months; but all inquirers at the White House were told that the President had not had a minute to look at the case. Pancner was employed in a big Detroit manufacturing plant, the head of which has written to the Department of Justice describing Pancner as a model workman whom they were anxious to reemploy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The treatment of Fay contrasts with the attitude displayed towards three political prisoners who are Swedish nationals — Carl Ahl-teen, Siegfried Stenberg and Ragnar Johannsen. The Swedish Government asked for the release of these men and offered to pay their expenses back to Sweden. Yet the Attorney General refused to order their deportation on the ground that it might encourage other foreigners to come here and “violate our laws.” The only law these men are accused of violating is the Wilson war rule which, in spite of our Constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech, made any word that could be construed as against war a felony. These men have already served four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Fay is virtually the last of the German spies in our prisons. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">They</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> have all been freed. Powerful influences worked for clemency for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">them. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The seventy-five political prisoners are almost all merely </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> workingman, without political pull of any kind. The idea of the Administration seems to be that the German dynamiters were merely poor fellows on the wrong side of the late unpleasantness, and that their offenses were not comparable to those of the miscreants who had the effrontery to oppose war itself on humanitarian grounds.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Heating and Humidity </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By p. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">h.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Gross</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OU can greatly save your coal and wood supply, keep warmer and avoid catching colds by the simple method of keeping the air moist in your home or your room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The attention of the public has often been called to the importance of securing a proper amount of moisture in the air of heated rooms in winter, and but few have given this important subject much attention. It is not proposed to raise the room humidity (percent of moisture) to a point equal to that prevailing in the outside air. The average temperature in New York city between October and April is 44°, and the average humidity is 73 percent. For healthful, .conditions in that period the house temperature should range from 65* to 68* with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">humidity of about 60°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For a dwelling house of moderate size this means the addition to the air of from two to four gallons'of water in the form of vapor in each twenty-four hours, and in exceptionally cold weather as much as nine gallons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">No one can well take exception to the recommended temperature limits and house humidity; for they are precisely the same as those of a mild day in May or June. This ought to be a sufficient answer to those who suggest that a soggy atmosphere is being advocated. When the temperature outside drops below fifty degrees the heating of the air to a temperature of approximately seventy-two degrees reduces the humidity to less than thirty percent. This does not mean that there is less water in the air. It merely means that at a temperature of seventy-two degrees the air is capable of holding much more water, and this water (moisture) should be supplied by you. It is strenuous on the air passages and lungs to be constantly passing from a humidity in your home of thirty percent to an outside humidity, of seventy percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Humidity Retards Drafts</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ITH the room having the correct amount of moisture in it there is the advantage of doing away with the annoying draft when a window or door is open; for the room now is of more uniform temperature, and the correct temperature with moisture makes difficult the draft</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In very eold weather it is unnecessary to force the heating apparatus to the utmost capacity a waste of time and coal In furnace-heated houses a sufficient supply of water must be brought near enough to the firepot to evaporate the needed amount It is worth while to run an outlet from the water supply into the hot-air space; and this may, if it is desired, be arranged to supply the water automatically. This also can be turned on by hand when coal is added to the furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In many cases the problem would be that of a tenant in a steam-heated building or in a single rbom or apartment under his control. Water containers can be had which fit closely to the pipes of radiators, or moistened cloths placed on the radiator will quickly supply the moisture necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In cold weather the apartment can be made very comfortable by drawing a few inches of hot water into the bathtub.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">One test of whether the air of a building is properly moistened is determined by whether or not delicate plants will grow with satisfaction without being kept under glass. Another test is whether the windows tend to frost in cold weather. If they do not, the air is too dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Overcoming DifRcuttieo</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">N PRIVATE dwellings it is customary to leave the care of a furnace entirely to a furnace man who calls at intervals. It is impossible for that man to know what effect his work is having upstairs, and with a number of furnaces to attend to his work is necessarily wasteful of coaL A close supervision, with directions from time to time from the householder, is absolutely necessary for satisfactory and economical results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">So far as the amount of moisture in the air is concerned it is safe to say that it is not likely that toq much will be secured. For house temperatures the difference between a wet and a dry bulb thermometer should be about eight degrees, and not more than ten degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">However, one may trust his own sensations in the matter, and if the home has the feeling of a fine Jjme day one may know that both temperature and humidity are about right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is sometimes suggested that heat is absorbed in the changing of water into vapor. This of course is true, but the amount of heat used in that way is very small compared with the saving of coal in the lower temperature permitted by a proper amount of moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus moist air means warmth, colds seldom, and better health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bew to Toot for Humidity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A NY person can learn the amount of humidity in the air, inside or outside, by ths following explanation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A wet bulb thermometer is an ordinary thermometer with a clean muslin cloth tied tightly around it The overlapping of the muslin may be one-third, not more for best results. This can best be put on the bulb when the muslin is wet To get the humidity in the air simply dip the thermometer bulb into a glass of cool water for a few seconds, then take it out and either fan it or whirl it until the mercury goes down as far as it will before beginning to rise. Of course you first note the reading of the thermometer before you wet the cloth (muslin), and now you read it after you have fanned it until it will not go down any lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now subtract the wet bulb reading from the dry bulb reading. The greater the difference the less humidity you have, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This same thermometer with muslin cover gives accurate air temperature when dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The following table is large enough for a good household guide — for temperature and moisture inside. The left column of figures is that of your temperature (dry bulb), the top row is your difference. Thus if you have a temperature of sixty-eight degrees and a difference of seven, you find your temperature of sixty-eight to the left and go straight acrosa until you come to the column of the difference of seven, where you find your humidity to be sixty-seven percent.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Replies to a Questionnaire</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[The Reverend 0. J. Armentrout of Pittaburg, Kansas, sent out a questionnaire io *00 people of Ha efty recently, inviting answers. One of these requests fell into the hands of a local Bible Student, E. T. Harda</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">way, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who favored Reverend Armentrout with the following rejoinder to his question*. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These replies art </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">quite enlightening; and we have no doubt took </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">load from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reverend </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Armentrout, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">i. e., they no doubt </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">got a rise out of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is comforting to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the clergy beginning to ask for information which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have hitherto declined and which, at the same time, they have withheld from the people. Evidences of intelligence in this direction should be encouraged. Up until now the clergy has managed to hold down its job without any appreciable mental effort whatever. &quot;And my people love to have it so, and what will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ye </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">do in the end thereof ?”—Jeremiah 6: 31.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR questionnaire, as published in recent daily papers, with an invitation to others beside the 200 to whom you mailed them specially, to reply to the questions contained therein, is before me; and I take pleasure in accepting your invitation, and am sending the answers and this open letter through the same medium, as I presume you would wish all to see the answers who have read the questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Presbyterian minister, I trust you will accept as good authority my quotations which are from a Presbyterian Commentary, Jamison Faussit-Brown, which commentary, in a general way, answers all of your questions. Under the subject heading &quot;Harlots” we read: “Not only Rome, but Christendom as a whole has become a harlot.” (VoL 4, p. 613) “False Christendom divided into very many sects is truly Babylon, that is, confusion.”—VoL 4, p. 621.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If the Jamison Faussit-Brown Commentary is correct in its conclusion that Christendom is Babylon, then John the Revelator in the 18th chapter of Revelation gives in the following language a very vivid and repulsive picture of Christendom, and leaves no doubt as to its inefficiency for doing the Lord’s work: “Babylon the great, is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” If the foregoing is a true picture of Christendom (If it is not, blame Jamison Faussit-Brown and John the Revelator), I'See no reason why God should use the apostate system in His work, any more than He should use the children of Israel in His service, after they had become a harlot nation. “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” is the injunction of the Scriptures.—Isa. 52:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Requirements suggested in this text, is it any great wonder that Jehovah has ceased to cooperate with apostate Christendom, resulting in the legion of failures that everywhere mark its pathway!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With these preliminary remarks, I will endeavor to answer a part if not all of your questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 1:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Do you believe the church is at the cross-roads and should take a definite stand in the solution of social, economic problems!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">No. The church reached the cross-roads in the year 1878, took the wrong road, and has now reached the brink of the ditch (See Matthew 15:14); hence is in no position to taka a definite stand on any question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 3:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is the church hindered in its work by too much self-ease or indifference on the part of its membership!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Lord’s answer to this question is: “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would that thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not, that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”—Revelation 3:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 3:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Are the church and other moral forces over-organized If so, what in your opinion is the. remedy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Yes; they are over-organized even to their utter destruction. Remedy: Leave the doomed and stranded ship, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> into the lifeboat and pull for the shore, or in other words, “Come out of her,” as instructed in Revelation 18:4, and as advised by Jamison Faussit-Brown in comments on this text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 4:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> What would increase the efficiency of the church, and strengthen ita position in the community!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Nothing would increase its efficiency. A new patch of efficiency put on the old garment of inefficiency, would only make the rent worse. (See Luke 5:36; Matthew 9: 16; Mark 2: 21) The only thing to do is to get rid of the old system, which the Lord is rapidly doing, just as He got rid of the old Jewish church-system when it forsook its first love. The Lord was not dependent on the old Jewish system for the accomplishment of His plan and purposes. No more is He dependent on unfaithful Christendom for the carrying out of His will at the present time. It would be too bad to have its position strengthened in any community, as long as it is so hopelessly inefficient.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 5:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> What criticism would you make upon the pulpit of the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> As I hesitate to use language that would fitly express my criticism of the pulpit, I will therefore forbear, and allow the prophet Isaiah to do it for me: “His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, everyone for his gain from his quarter.”—Isaiah 56:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 6:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> To what extent should the church enter into the relation of capital and labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> They should not enter into these relations at all, but follow the suggestion of St Paul when he said: “I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.” If the example of the Apostle had been adopted by the churches all over the world — remembering the words of the Lord Jesus when He said: “Ye are not of the world even as I am not of the world”—the wars and threatened wars, labor troubles, strikes, and lockouts would not be disturbing UB as they are now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 7:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Do hate and class schisms exist locally? If so, what can the church do to bring about a spirit of brotherhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Yes; to some extent class schisms exist, but the church can do nothing to bring about a spirit of brotherhood so long as it is devoid of the spirit of brotherhood within its own ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 8:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why do not all men who admit that the church is helpful to the community, actually support it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> I would suggest that if you can find any such men, they might be qualified to answer this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question 9:</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> What can the church do to reach men of every class and station in life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> I do not know, and if I did, I would not tell; for “ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> twofold more a child of hell [gehenna] than yourselves.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>A Hard Nut for Evolutionists</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ORE than four hundred years ago, during the Chinese Ming dynasty, the Chinese used in embroidery work needles that were very much smaller than can now be had anywhere in the world. A despatch from Washington describing these fine needles and the work which they accomplished, discloses that evolutionists have nothing whereof to boast when it comes to comparing ancient embroideries with those of the present day. The report has reference to a collection of embroideries brought from Shanghai by the wife of one of the judges of the international court at that place and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“So fine is the work that the finest details of the features of the figures represented were dear; the hairs on the men’s beards, small muscles in the littlest figures, even the minutely worked long-pointed finger nails and the eyelashes were so perfect that to be appreciated, experts declared, they had to be viewed through a powerful microscope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The smallest needle in the world, which is itself much finer than the finest thread, is now in the National Museum here, yet the experts said the Chinese work must have been done with a needle slim enough to pass through the eye of that needle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord! Our only salvation is there;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It carries conviction down deep in the heart, And shows us ourselves as we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It tells of a Savior, and points to the cross, Where pardon we now may secure;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And we know that when time and the world pass away God’s Word shall forever endure.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>God’s Seven Messengers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By R. 0. Watson</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS generally understood by Bible students of the present time that the panorama of the seven churches of Revelation, chapters 2 and 3, is intended to convey the thought that the church of God during this age is being dealt with by God, its great Shepherd, according to the progressive stages of its development, seven in number, or according to its need of protection against error, or its guidance along that pathway of ever-increasing light and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This being accepted as a ground for the interpretation of these chapters, it follows that the seven angels mentioned are some special servants, messengers of God, provided by the great Shepherd of the sheep, each to help the church during his lifetime and to provide a foundation for faith and works until the everadvancing purposes of Jehovah, with increasing light and knowledge, culminate in a new stage with its necessary crisis in the affairs of the church. Then it is needful for a new leader, messenger, on earth to rally the saints to the new truths and works in the new stage of the church's progress and to protect them against errors past and present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In a consideration of the office held by these leaders, it will be noticed that, while it is necessary to the great outcome that their messages and work must show a varied progressiveness according to their day and stage, yet their natural talents and abilities and dispositions must be somewhat similar to enable them to succeed in the office to which they were called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We living in the end of the age have the advantage of being able to scan the corridor of the ages and note the painful march of the church down the stream of time; and, helped by the searchlight of divine purposes, we can with certainty pick out each of these seven men who was honored with the office of being God’s mouthpiece to his day and time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The progress of events has proven the accuracy of St Paul’s forecast that there would be a serious falling away from the primitive simplicity of the church’s faith, hope, and practice before the desire of all nations should result from God’s long-promised kingdom being established -^among men. This prophecy, now history, is the key that enables us to see what would be the official work and message of these God-given leaden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Church history shows us what we would </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pect— that St Paul, the messenger to the church in its introductory stage, was used to establish and settle the infant church; to guard it against errors of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">dead, but in no sense forgotten, past; and to warn against those of the future calculated to fulfil his prophetic picture of apostasy. How faithfully he carried out his official task and heralded wide his message, is outlined for us in the New Testament account When details are fully known, his reputation will be enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The second stage of church history was the natural one of activity’s increasing influence. It was honored with recognition, opposition, threats, and persecution from the powers that were destined to be superseded by itself. Thus the message needed was not one of new and greater light to give joy and comfort to the saints, so much as one to give and inspire courage, steadfastness, fortitude, and faith in God and in each other, that they might be able to stand the opposition raised against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Who was better able to accomplish this task than the strong yet tender, sympathetic, loving St. John? History tells us that he was a tower of strength during the period of these persecutions from pagan Rome, which extended even beyond his own day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When Error Began to Thrice</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE third stage saw the realization of St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul’s fears; for it began in the foretold falling away in matters of faith, hope, and practice. This was caused by the church leaders, who lowered the Christian standard, so that the church might become popular and occupy the place and power of its persecutors. This was the time when error took firmer root and flourished, beginning in the Council of Nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As this third period was the time when error was developing, it will be seen that the work and message of God’s chief servant for this period could not be one chiefly of missionary zeal, nor of advancing light and truth, but rather of determined effort to stem the rising tide of error, resulting in much controversy as the battle waged pro and con.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As we read the church history of these early centuries we have no difficulty in seeing that one man, Arius, stands out preeminently above all others for the things as taught by Jesus and His apostles. We see that Arius stood like a mighty breakwater against the rising flood of error which dashed and beat against the bulwarks of Christianity. Time and again the waves of error were made almost harmless as they were opposed by a wall of truth, built up with irresistible logic by that stalwart leader of the faithful</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">su</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">From the history of that time we learn that this fight was waged largely around the personality of our Savior, with, of course, kindred errors that followed in the wake of the initial one. This warfare reached its height in the Council of Nice, 325 A D., where the pagan doctrine of the Trinity was fastened upon the church of God. Yet the Herculean labors of this third messenger of God to His people saved the church the shame of universally accepting this masterpiece of Satan’s doctrines, for at least one hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The untiring efforts of this remarkable man as he resisted this crushing error with simple but powerful logic stands as a memorial to the power and influence of courage and faithfulness. Error, borne by popularity and backed by the influence of kings, scattered the people of God and compelled them to huddle together in little bands, where they could counsel and cheer one another, and prepare themselves for the next onslaught of the devil through the then recognized &quot;Christian” world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Arius laid down his sword of truth in the restful slumber of death, to await the glorious reward of all those who fight a good fight for truth and right In the glorified church he will shine forth amongst the brightest jewels in the beautiful diadem of God, and take his place with others who have waged the successful warfare against sin and Satan. Notwithstanding the fact that the introduction of the doctrine of the Trinity into the Christian faith through unscrupulous means was supported by kings temporal and ecclesiastical, yet so strongly organized was the opposition under this renowned leader that the church was divided upon it for over one hundred years; and it is said that some emperors and popes privately held what they publicly termed heresy, holding the truth in abeyance through hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As St Paul foresaw, error won and has since been the standard test of nominal Christians, Arius the faithful, being known as the leader of the &quot;Arian Heresy.” However, a new day is now dawning and things must be seen in their true light; and this faithful servant of God will be known during the countless ages to come as the stalwart opponent of the &quot;trint-itarian” nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The work of the first three stages of the church had to do, respectively, with (1) introduction and growth, (2) pagan persecution, and (3) development of errors. Thus it follows that the messages for these periods were also different. The New Testament proves that the message for the first period dealt with faith, doctrines, and organization, coupled with intense missionary zeal; the next message was a practical one — to put the lessons previously learned into practice and to hold fast and encourage one another against persecution; that of the third period was a severe testing time for proving loyalty and devoting to God by continuing in Hie things taught in the first period and suffered for in the second — in other words, by a determined stand not to be moved about by every wind of doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dark Night of Papal Supremacy</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230214_files/g_E_19230214-5.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ET notwithstanding the brave stand made . by Arius and co-workers history and present-day teachings prove that error gained eon- . trol in high places and was thus taught and accepted by the rank and file. The foretold falling away was an accomplished fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">However, we know this condition was to be allowed but for a time, after which truth would again come slowly to light and ultimately entirely displace error. History tells us that there was a long lapse of time before this needed reformation began to shine forth and the Bible truths were again put into their proper place in the minds and hearts of God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime it was needful to keep alive the sacred love of truth in God’s real people, the few that remained amidst the formalism of those times; for God has never been without some witnesses against wrong and error. Yet during the dark ages these were so poor and . few, and the opposition was so strong and vigorous, that but little of their doings have come down to us. They were but keeping the embers glowing until the time should come when God’s favor would blow them into a living, holy flame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">During this period Papal Borne reigned supreme, to the outward view. However, out of the darkness of ignorance, bigotry and superstition, the name and work of Peter Waldo, “The Merchant of Lyons,” stands ont with glowing conspicuousness. Without doubt he was God’s anointed servant for that time and, thus ordained, he was able to draw together physically and in the bonds of love and truth God’s scattered people. By the translation of the Bible into French he was able also to feed the faithful with much true doctrine and to erect a foundation upon which the reformers by God’s grace were enabled to build.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This was the time when Papal Rome touched the zenith of its power and ruled Europe with a rod of iron, crushing without favor all who crossed its path, particularly the followers of Waldo, who were given over to extermination time and again, and for many generations had to fight for their physical as well as for their religious lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The work and spirit of Waldo lingered long after his day and resulted in a period of greater Bible searching under Wycliffe, whose labors encouraged and held together those true followers of the Lamb that remained from Papal persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Wycliffe’s work was to provide the material for the coming Reformation; and, as Bible study was necessary to this he became the leader of many who used their time and talents in an effort to get the Scriptures into the common tongue of the people. He himself was responsible for the first translation into the English language, a thing which Rome opposed with all her might in her palmy days. The Church of England is not guiltless in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light Infiltrates the Gloom</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230214_files/g_E_19230214-6.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">O PROTESTANT will for a moment question that Luther was the next God-given helper of true Christians to further the Reformation movement, destined to progress until error lit doctrine and practice shall be things of a never-to-be-forgotten past. With characteristic courage and zeal Luther commenced the warfare against entrenched error as soon as he recognized it, and became the champion of truth for all who mourn in Zion. With tongue ancFpen he spared not wrong nor </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">self in helping and guiding those who protested against Papacy, and in God’s providence was used to bring many truths to light, and perhaps was even more useful in gaining a political freedom for those who sought surcease from Papal enslavement, thus making it possible for the Reformation to go on as God saw it to be expedient and best. But after his day the spirit of Luther soon waned. Instead of the church wiping away all error and continuing in a real reformation that placed all truth then due in the hands of God’s people, it was lulled to sleep by the edversary. The reformers soon became satisfied to rest upon their oars and drift with the tide; and later became so deceived that many actually persecuted those who were carrying on the Reformation work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">While the sixth (or Luther) stage of the church saw the work of reform launched, yet history proves that it remained for the last of these stages or periods to finish this great and important work; for the creeds held were many and contradictory, and the Bible was still largely a closed book. But this was not always to be. The divine purpose was to use the Reformation to cleanse the church from the mass of professors that came in with error during the third period, that God’s true people might have oneness of heart and mind and of doo-trine as in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This was done by the Bible becoming an open and clear book, enabling God’s people to see His purposes and plans for the human race, showing the Bible to be a harmonious revelation of those purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The time will come when no </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> will doubt that Charles Taze Russell was the last or seventh messenger to the church. By God’s grace he was privileged to unfold the meaning of the Scriptures as no one else since the days of the apostles. The publication of these findings in all civilized countries constitute the harvest message of the age, which is proving who loves truth better than error; and which marks those who desire God’s favor before the approval of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As we view the talents and characteristics of these seven men, we find the same golden threads running through all of them; the same logic and reason, the same love of truth, the same unbounded zeal, the same undaunted courage, the same faithfulness to their mission ; and, the same spiritual power and inspiring influence. Each had the God-given ability to put his message into writing to serve those who after his own little day were seeking after</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A study of the outstanding talents of these men will prove that they were well fitted for the special work of the respective periods: Paul, reason; John, love; Arius, logic; Waldo, zeal, Wycliffe, education with literary ability; Luther, courage; while the last, owing to the peculiar needs of his day, had Giese talents in combination with an immense aptitude for business so much needed in carrying on a world-wide work of stupendous proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">While secular history is shrouded in gloom the Bible explains this in one sentence: “The god of this world [Satan] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of Chid [Jehovah], should shine unto them.” (2 Corinthians 4:4) But sacred history coupled with the divine promises presents a brighter view and inspires hope to the trusting children of the Almighty. The unfolding of the light through these seven stages of the church</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">W, %</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">should be noticed as progressive — the light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. The fact that the plan of God is now revealed to our wondering gaze is the sure indication that we are on the threshold of the Day of Christ — the new heavens and the new earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness” is upon us. And just so sure as we can now see the preparation for the Lord’s kingdom in the multitudinous inventions and labor-saving devices, and the flooding of the world with wonderful, heart-cheering books explaining the purposes of the Living God, are we convinced that the “workers of iniquity” and the blasphemers of God’s holy name in the “doctrines and precepts of men,” as represented in our creeds, shall be, and are, put to flight and are fast approaching the precipice over which they shall drop into oblivion. And the only way these men can save themselves is by hastily divorcing themselves from their old noxious beliefs and becoming acquainted with the Holy Scriptures as set forth by the Lord Himself, His apostleS, prophets, and messengers.</span></p>

Let us consider these three parts of the British Empire as separately marked in the prophecy. Then there is the Papal Empire, which is merely an empire on paper, but nevertheless has a strong position in the world' due to the recognition of it by other rulers.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;'“Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews! for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” (Matthew 2:1, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2)</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be it noted that these wise men went directly to Herod, a representative of Satan. If- the star guiding them was sent by the Lord Jehovah, why would He guide them to Herod, a representative of Satan, and a mortal enemy of the babe Jesus! If the sole purpose of the star was to guide these men to the place of Jesus’ birth there was no need for them to go to Herod at all. The reasonable answer, then, is that Satan had prepared a great conspiracy with the object of destroying the babe. A conspiracy is a design to commit a wrongful act in &quot;which two or more join in committing the act or some part of it. Sometimes persons are involved in a conspiracy and participate without knowing the real purpose of the one who forms the conspiracy. Such may have been the case with these wise men; but without doubt Satan had formed and directed it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>MS</sup>When these wise men came into the presence of Herod, he was troubled, because he feared the new king would interfere with his reign; and he “gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people [the seed of Satan and also his representatives — John 8:44] together and demanded of them where Christ should be born”— in other words he demanded to know where the babe Jesus could be found. Then Herod, in furtherance of the conspiracy, privately consulted with these wise men. We now see Herod manifesting one of the characteristics of Satan: viz., deception, in this, that he pretended to desire himself to find the babe Jesus, that he might go and worship Him; whereas all the facts and circumstances show that his real purpose was that he might find the babe in order to destroy Him. “Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. AM he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed ; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1M</sup>We cannot for a moment believe that the heavenly Father would use a wicked one like Herod and aid him in carrying out his wicked purpose by having a star to direct these three wise men to the place of Jesus’ birth, in view of the fact that the king had demanded that they should return and report to him, and when it was King Herod’s purpose to destroy the babe. The fact is that the devil and his instruments, Herod and others, would have succeeded in this wicked conspiracy and have caused the death of the babe Jesus had not God intervened to save the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">***The wise men reaching Bethlehem found the babe and brought their presents and worshiped. Without a doubt it was their intention to return and report to Herod. And the result of such a return would have been the death of the child. But God here intervened and warned them in a dream. These wise magicians relied upon dreams. “Being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.” Satan again was thwarted in his wicked purpose.</span></p>

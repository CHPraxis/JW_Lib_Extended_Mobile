<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Impressions of</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EFORE a person can spend five weeks in Britain, or even five minutes, he must find ' some way to get out of the United States, if he chances to have been born an American citizen and to have lived here all his days. And getting out of the United States is not such an easy matter as one might </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If the opportunity arose for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to visit the British Isles, his first thought might be: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> will go and get my ticket immediately”; but if he tried to do so he would find that tickets to European countries are not sold in that way. Before one can travel, he must first obtain a passport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If he thought: “I will get my passport immediately,” he next discovered that passports are not like newspapers, but are more like the plans and specifications for building a house. The Government seems to have formed the opinion that whoever wishes to travel is of the criminal class, or at least is a suspicious person ; and that his desire to absent himself from these shores for even a brief time indicates a strong probability that he should be locked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Government first wishes a photograph; and it has to be a special kind of photograph, too—a front view, 3x3 inches in size and on a white background. Then the Government wishes to know that you have been born; that when you were ’&lt;orn, or at least some time prior thereto, you had parents; and that these parents were your ancestors. The Government seems to wish to know that one of these parents was your father; for his name is asked, and it is necessary to supply an affidavit from some one who knows that you really were born; and that you are still alive; and that at the date of youi\ proposed trip you are the same person that ygu were at the time*you were born, or words to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then comes the first inquisition. You go to a trusted friend of yours, and are carefully taken •part, and put down on paper before his search-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Britain </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Part i)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing scrutiny. He passes upon your age. This is an important item. It affords circumstantial evidence that you are old enough to travel, if you have the money and the inclination. How could the Government trust you with a passport if it did not know you were old enough to travel T</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your height is put down. This is also important. If you were only a foot high, it would not be safe for you to dross the streets; and while you might do very well boarding steamers and railway trains, yet it would be very hard for you to climb to the top deck of an omnibus; and the Government does not wish you to run the risk of stubbing your toe and failing to reach the seats where the best view of the scenery is to be obtained. Again, the Government would not feel like issuing a passport to you if you were twelve feet high; for in that case if you took a top seat in the omnibus and the omnibus tipped over, it might be claimed that you tipped it over; and if you were found among the wreckage there might be complications for the Government as well as for yourself. It is best to be safe. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The kind of forehead you have is then put down. It is wise to do this. There was once a prophet concerning whom it was written, &quot;1 will make thy forehead like adamant.” It might be that you have an adamant forehead, and with everything so high it stands to reason that the Government does not wish to lose any prophets just at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What about Your Face ?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230117_files/g_E_19230117-3.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EXT a record is made of your eyes. This is to make sure that you will be able to cross the streets while away from home. It is also to save the Government the embarrassment which would be occasioned by having it published abroad that the paternal U. S. A. is raising cyclops instead of citizens. 11 you have but one eye, and that is right in the middle of your forehead, you don't go abroad. That is all there is to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mention is made of your particular variety of nose. You see, it is this way; Julius Caesar was a Boman, and therefore had a Roman nose. He went away a perfectly good citizen of a republic; but on the way back he came to the Rubicon, jumped in, swam ashore, and took the liberties of the people away from them. If you have a Roman nose, what is to hinder you from jumping into the Atlantic Ocean on the way back home and suddenly putting the whole 110,000,000 people of America under the iron heel of despotism! You could do it, oh, so easily! Everybody said that the Kaiser could do it sure. So if you have a Roman nose, you had better see a beauty doctor before you ask for a passport. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your friend wishes to know about your mouth. The Government has reason to wish to know about this; for the mouths of Americans get them into more trouble while they are abroad than does any other one thing. They think that they are citizens of the greatest country under the sun, and they like to mention the fact; at least they do until they find that this is just what everybody else thinks of his own particular land. Besides, the Government wishes to know that you will be able to take your meals in the usual way. It does not wish foreign governments put to the annoyance and inconvenience of feeding you through a tube in your nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then there is the chin. Lady Astor, an American girl that has found her way into the British Parliament, is authority for the statement that Americans have good chins. (And ■he is reputed to have used a cuss word when ■he said it.) The Government wishes to live up to its reputation in not sending anybody abroad unless he has a chin of some sort; so if your </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ehin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is missing you can count on staying right in Podflik until the robins nest again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tike </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bair Quettion</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TN</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">AT.T.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">V, there is the hair question. Now this a Serious matter in the minds of some people; or &nbsp;&nbsp;not in their minds, let us say on</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">top of their minds. There are those that insist that hair and brains cannot be grown on opposite sides of the same scalp at the same time. Then there are others who claim, as did one Hilkiah Crooks of yore, that a goodly thatch of feathers is necessary, and that if one does not have it he will be minus the necessary pipes wherewith to lead off the fog and smoke that otherwise becloud the brain. Doubtless the Government is collecting statistics to determine which is right — the bald-headed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> who boldly claims that wisdom has taken the place of his hair, or the thick-haired youth who feelingly reminds the Government that the strength of any government lies in its men, and that the strength of Samson, the strongest of all men, lay in his hair. “Sometime we'll understand.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We said: “Finally there is the hair question”; but it was not finally. The Government wishes to know whether you have a complexion. This is more important in America than it is in the British Isles; for there the damp climate gives everybody a good natural complexion, while here there are many people who would not dare to leave home without bringing their complexions along with them in a vanity bag or something like that. The Government is interested to know whether your complexion is a real one or whether you got it at the corner drug-store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When it gets to the matter of having a face and of deciding what kind of face you have, there may perchance be a row between you and your friend. He wishes to put you down as having a thin face; but you do not wish to go down in history or even down in the Atlantis as having a thin face. You plead with him; you point out that with seven kinds of faces on the list he should be able to pick you out a better one. But he is obdurate, and he shall be punished as befits the offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then comes the second inquisition. You and your trusted friend go before a passport official of the United States Department of State. The official looks you over critically. His is a very important job. He represents the whole imperial United States Government, in one of its most important departments. His decision on this great matter now to be decided is final He crosses out the word &quot;thin” opposite the description of your face, and writes in the word “ovaJL”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You glance piercingly and haughtily at your friend to see .whether he takes in the full magnitude of his unstatesmanlike analysis of your features. He seems utterly oblivious; he doea not seem to realize* how nearly he has jeopardized the good reputation of our State Department abroad. Suppose now that the State Department had overlooked his error; think what international animosities and ether things just like them might have happened. One shudders to think of it, even with shudders selling as high as a shilling apiece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paying for Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE inspector gathers in your application for passport, and your birth certificate, and your photographs. Then he collects $10 for doing his sworn duty in giving you an oval face, and tells you that you will receive the passport in four or five days. This “service” was formerly free; but since the world was made safe for democracy some jobs must be found for the increased number of democrats and a way must be found to soak the democracy every way they turn, or they might forget that they are free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Uncle Sam’s example of piggishness in the free issuance of passports has been followed by all countries toward citizens of the United States. Europe contains a score of countries, and the United States is but one. Therefore when a United States citizen visits ten European countries on a trip (and most across-ocean travel is in that direction) he must pay $100 for having his passports viseed in the ten countries; but the European may go all over the United States on the one $10 passport. Thus Uncle Sam charges his citizens $10 for an imaginary “service” before they leave home, knowing that, because of that charge of' $10, made without any proper reason, those citizens will be mulcted $10 more for every country that they visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Another Hold Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE third inquisition comes afer you have received your passport You go to the British Consulate in New York. There you are catalogued by a clerk and fined $10 for being an American^citizen; then careful inquiry is made as to whether you plan any propaganda while you are in the British Isles. In view of the purchased control of the U. S. press during the war, this latter item is properly one for \ i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__________</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">•A prince can mat a belted knight, A marquis, duke, and a’ that; But an honest man’s aboon his might— Quid faith, he maunna fa’ that 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the British Government to continue to consider. You pass inspection; your passport is visaed; it is stamped. You are now in the hole to the tune of $20; but you have received a piece of paper, folded, stamped with the great seal of the United States Government, and signed by Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Secretary of State, which proves beyond question that you have been born and that you a have a forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, hair, complexion, and a face, and that you are over one foot and under twelve feet in height A triumph of American diplomacy. Bomu)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You go and get your ticket. It is a foot high, and a foot and a half long, and recites encouragingly what responsibility the Company assumes respecting your baggage in case of a wreck, and what disposition will be made of your own remains, in case there are any remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The fourth inquisition Consists of a strip six inches wide, attached to one end of your ticket It asks the same old questions which you had to answer before you got your passport; and unless put into the hands of the transportation company the day before the ship sails, your right to sail on that ship is forfeited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cheer Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE back of the ticket itself is the fifth inquisition. The questions are the same as before. TJheer up I This is the last time that you must answer these questions until you get aboard the boat. At length the great day arrives. You are at the dock an hour ahead of time. You appear before an officer, who examines your passport and looks scrutinizingly at you to see if you are the person described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You start to go aboard, up the long carefully-enclosed gang-way, and are stopped once more. This time it is your ticket which is subjected to scrutiny, to see that it is made out in due form and properly endorsed. In another half minute you are out of the United States; i. e., you are aboard a British vessel, an auxiliary of the British navy and manned throughout by British seamen.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Who Has the Right to Make Prices? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By <sup>r</sup>A. H. Kent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOULD the laborer price his labor; the producer of soil-products price them; the manufacturer his output; the wholesaler his commodity, and the retailer his wares!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who will agree to such a proposition as a whole! Who believes that it could be made to work out justly for all! And yet is not this what each faction is trying to do, and trying to prevent the others from doing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If this system of pricing is right for one class, it must be right for all But if it will not work well for all, then the principle must be entirely wrong; for each class of workers is vitally interested in the price of the products of all the rest Being a thing of collective interest, price should be regulated by all that are interested either as producers or as consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If the reins of our Government have gotten into the hands of those that neither labor nor produce, then such Government should have no part in pricing the products of the labor of those who do labor, until it is again subject to the will of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither should the laborer and producer make the oft-repeated mistake of choosing other delegates or representatives to make prices for them. Deputing power to a few representatives to act for the whole people invites the attack of all opposing interests upon those few. If they are thus influenced, or yield, the cause of the people is lost</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To a large extent people have test faith in representative government Experience, they believe, has taught that it is cheaper to pay a good round profit to private interests than to place industries under government control to be operated at cost The claim is that the tendency to graft on the one side equals the tendency to profiteer on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When private capital goes into business it exacts every possible profit for the interests behind it That the burden of these profits is equaled or outweighed by the waste, incompetency, and graft of our administrators is a compliment (!) many of our public men are paying to themselves and to our public institutions when they fight government ownership. We mentioi this to show that there is little chance of improvement unless the people keep the government more in their own hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the people use every modern method and appliance to save labor and to increase production: and their efforts to better conditions mo</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">will oome to naught, as long as it is given to a few men, or to any one class of men, to arbitrarily make prices. And a government, that is to any extent controlled by special interests — whether that of fanners, laborers, manufacturers, merchants, or preachers — would be no exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those that produce and labor in social service are the ones who are interested collectively in the prices at which they must exchange the products of their labor. Collectively they have the right to get together and name the standard wages upon which all product prices should be based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The legitimate object of government is to search out and protect the individual rights and means of its subjects. Experience shows that the people should never delegate their rights away but should reserve to themselves the final decision of all questions by suffrage. It is an old saying, &quot;If you want any thing done do it yourself.” If not, send someone else to do it, and this is especially true of governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The opposition to a system of standard prices will come either from those who from lack of thought fail to see its great benefits or from the comparatively few that are now profiting by the existing unsettled and unjust price conditions. All classes of labor engaged in useful pursuits, including fanners that own anc work their own farms, and merchants anc small factory owners who do their own labor, are interested in a wage that in buying power will equal the price of the products they collectively produce and distribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To accomplish much, men must make the best use of the means at hand. Each class of labor has an organization for the betterment of their own conditions; and over these is an organization of which all are a part and to which all are subject, the United States Government. Whatever we may expect of farm and labor unions, it is evident that they can do little as long as the general Government is controlled by those of opposing interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That a government of the people should so look after the interests of its every subject that no other organization for that purpose would be necessary, we believe is evident to alL But the number and kind of such unions is a monumental evidence that it does not. It occurs to us that if each union would take eg</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the subject of a standard wage and standard product-prices based on labor cost, and discuss it until thoroughly understood by its members, they would demand such a system and vote it through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">More good could be done at one election by installing a system of prices that would equalize the expense of living and properly distribute the fruits of labor, than has been done by Congress and Legislatures for the last one hundred and forty-five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who is now making our prices! Is it the laborer and producer who, together, are the great consumer! Or is it the go-between, the juggler, and the gambler! Shall we, as usual, leave prices for Congress to influence by tinkering with the tariff, rail rates and ship rates, farm credits, etc.; or shall we turn the job over to the Reserve Banks! Three years ago they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fixed</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> prices and almost </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fixed</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> everything else by juggling interest rates, bank creditors, bond markets, and cash reserves; and no one questions that they can and will do the same thing again if it suits their purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Or shall we try the plan of Irvin Fisher, Professor of Political Economy of Yale University and ex-President of the American Economic Association, for taking the starch out of one of the few standards we have, the dollar, by trying to follow up our ever-changing prices with an ever-changing dollar! Professor Fisher, your currency would not make even a good football. You could never tell how much it was inflated, and when you got the thing all puffed up and ready to kick off, some one might be fool enough to name prices on a gold basis and that would knock the wind clear out of it. Now, Professor, really do you think you can ever kick a goal with a dollar like that!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prices are figured from the amount of gold represented; and not from the denomination of the currency representing it. We have a dollar that'is as standard in weight as the yard measure is in length, or as the bushel is in capacity; and it would be just as reasonable to expect the yard measure to indicate the price of the product it is used to measure, or for the bushel measure to price the product that passes through it, as to expect the dollar to Indicate the price, or measure the Value of the product for which it is exchanged. Pricing is feat the function of the dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The analyst separates product into its orig</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">inal elements; and by experiments and actual tests we determine the elements or properties that are useful; and that some are of more value than others; and that is about all we have accomplished in our effort to measure value. But let the true value of product be what it may, collectively we are interested in getting it at the least possible cost in labor; and for the purpose of exchanging products we should price them as near as possible to labor cost, so that each may receive equal value for his money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If prices are wrong, as every ones knows they are, then let us make prices that are right, and not unfix everything else in the hope that prices will in Some mysterious way adjust themselves. When we have properly standardized our labor, products, and other values, as we have our dollar, and rightly established the relation between them by a system of standard prices, we may go ahead doing business on a fair basis for a thousand years without a price swing, strike, lockout, panic, or millionaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We are glad to note the effort being made toward the standardization of product. &quot;The Truth in Fabric Bill” is surely a step ahead; but why not widen its scope! Draft a &quot;Truth in all Products Bill,” based on truth in labor, and truth in prices; then draft a “Truth in Legislation Bill,” that will enable us to pass all bills direct from the people to the statute books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not knowing whether a price is fair causes dissatisfaction the same as knowing it to be unfair. Social unrest will not or should not be alleviated until men place themselves under just regulations. With the help of divine wisdom, as already revealed in the Bible, it is possible for man to institute a just system of laws; but the power to keep those from breaking them who would so desire, is, of necessity, a superhuman power. We believe the time is near when such power will be used by the King of kings and Lord of lords; but used only as a means to an end. The end to be accomplished is a creation of human beings so schooled by experience and divine wisdom that no outside restraining power will be required. Man himself, an earthly image of his heavenly Creator, endowed with wisdom, justice, power, and love, will reign supreme in his own sphere, the earth. “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.”—Psalm 115:16.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>&quot;All the Foundations of the Earth are out of Course** </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Charles w. Apgar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE hopes that the human race will eventually overcome its tendency to be easily fooled, and will learn how to distinguish between truth and propaganda. Knowledge is the antidote; and knowledge of God’s Word is the best antidote. Although many have expected it, the earth will never “leave her course.” Prior to December 17, 1919, many of the inhabitants of the civilized earth (as distinguished from the heathen) expected a great calamity — on that date the earth was to be overtaken by another body and possibly be blown to atoms. Such superstitious ideas would be impossible, and the people would know this if they were thoroughly instructed in God’s Word. For instance, we read : “The earth abid-eth forever” and “He hangeth the earth upon nothing.” Of course, if the earth is hung upon nothing, there are no literal “foundations of the earth” to get out of course.—Ecclesiastes 1:4; Job 26:7; Psalm 82:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever.” (Psalm 104:5) The proper understanding of our text lies in the fact that throughout the Bible the word “earth” and “world” are quite frequently used in a symbolic sense, not meaning the literal planet on which we live but organized society. In proof of this, we offer 2 Peter 3: 6, 7, 13; Zephaniah 3:8, 9; Revelation 21:1. These scriptures are sufficient, with proper consideration, to convince any reasoning mind that not the literal earth and heavens are here referred to; but that they are mentioned as in our text, in a symbolic sense. Earth is a condition of social and civil arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our laws are some of the “foundation” stones. None will dispute the necessity for just and equitable laws. Laws are right and good and necessary, but unrighteous enforcement of laws is the greatest difficulty with which we. have to contend. Our laws are so written as to enslave us to lawyers. They are impossible of understanding by the common man of the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The following by Thomas Edison appeared in the Chicago </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald-Examiner</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of October 26, 1921, under the title, “Life Too Intricate”: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Life is becoming so intricate, so involved, so mixed up, that it is difficult to tell what will happen as the result of any act Government finance, and industry are daily becoming more fixed in a maze that human Ingenuity seems incapable of untangling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Those fellows down at Washington pass laws without any more knowledge of what effects will he produced than they might have if they were children. They pass a law to do one thing, and it does the reverse. They press a button here, and a totally unexpected explosion happens there. This is because the whole fabric of cul civilization is becoming so intricate that nobody can follow its designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“I began to notice this many years ago when a legislature out West passed a law giving a bounty for ths killing of coyotes, only to discover a few yean lata that, in the absence of coyotes, jack rabbits were multiplying »o rapidly the law had to be repealed and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bounty offered for the killing of rabbits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The tendency of our social structure is to form unions and belong to organizations and lodges—the Ku Klux Klan, the W. C. T. U., chnrch societies, etc.—societies for and against everything. It is not unusual to find one person belonging to several societies which are contrary the one to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Selfishness is so ingrained in our law-makers and enforcers that laws for the relief of our poor and oppressed are impossible to operate. There are “jokers” in nearly all laws. Money, not love, is back of all rule. We quote a well-known scientist:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Forty yean ago, Herbert Spencer wrote some wonderfully illuminating chapters on the complexity of civilization in his day. Spencer took up thirty-four laws enacted by the British Parliament for the relief of the poor, and demonstrated that thirty-two of then laws actually harmed the poor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our System of Trade</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UR competitive system of trade causes business to organize on an efficiency basis, which must of necessity not only reject the old and infirm, but soon kill off the able. The result of the continual driving for efficiency is recklessness, disease, and suicide. Another resuit is our false standard of salesmanship; that is, men are trained to sell people things they do not want. There are basements and storerooms full of articles, many of them quite useless, purchased from men trained to sell these things whether they are needed or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The main feature of our earth is big business ; and big business so controls the price of labor that men are not able even to provide a proper and decent home and surroundings for a growing family. As a consequence, marriage (which is the very foundation of our social structure) is reduced to a low estate. For instance: J J' the man is not able to provide for a good home, the wife must work; and since the wife must spend from seven to ten hours a day toiling to help support the family, the results are that she has no time to prepare good meals for the family. She must purchase prepared foods, of low food value, in order that she may be able to quickly prepare it, say in from ten to twenty minutes. Big business meets the emergency by preparing food and putting it up in packages, with the greater portion of the food properties removed — the main argument, of course, being that they are prepared so easily and quickly that husband will not have to wait for from one to two hours for dinner.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">m</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Low vitality results from eating these improper foods, and consequently there is a greater need for doctors; and doctors are not in business for their health—nor for ours, either. Of course it is true that the doctor is glad to come when called upon, and that he does his very best to effect a cure; but the point is that it would be much better if the doctors were organized on the basis of keeping people well, rather than of curing them after their health is once impaired. The spirit of the new age will be along new lines — keeping people from getting sick, rather than healing them. “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.”—Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At present, many schools of medicine are contrary one to the other, each forming associations to fight the other, and trying to pass laws to forbid others the right to practise. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Politicians</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">hE</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> politicians, who draw good salaries, increase the burden of the tax-payers year by year; and they are looking on while the doctors, lawyers, preachers, etc., are digging down deeper into the poor man’s pockets. These are the foundation stones that are out of course. Selfishness is the mortar which is supposed to hold these stones together, that they may form a good solid foundation. But this foundation is crumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Church Sytlenu</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE chureli systems, professing to be friends of the poo? producers, desert them in times of need, such as strikes and unemployment, calling them Bolsheviki, etc. They hate failed utterly to help the oppressed in times of direst need. Without one word of objection or of warning one hundred and eighty thousand preachers and priests permitted the financiers of this country to throw us into the greatest war the earth has ever known, producing countless bereaved mothers and widows. When the history of all the cowards has been written, these 180,-000 preachers and priests will head the list. When I think of heroes, I have only to think of many of the widows left behind, with large families, to face the ever-rising prices and poor pay to women, yet bravely facing all the difficulties of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Other classes who prey upon the masses, worthy of mention in this article, are those who profess to be friends of the poor, yet who taka advantage of their every weakness, their every difficulty, and who run second only to the preachers, are the pawn-brokers, the loan sharks, and credit clothiers. Do not these advertise themselves as friends of the poor? Yet are they not exacting from the poor more than the poor are able to pay and more than others do pay? For instance: Do not credit clothiers charge $75 for a $35 suit and require first payment of $25 cash? And do not newspapers and magazines, except Tick Golden Age, take their advertisements and fail to expose them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is true that the earth slightly recognizes her unstableness; and therefore we have what we are pleased to call “our daily portion of reformless reforms.” We have “sex equality” now, which of course means social confusion. We have prohibition now, which means instead of beer at five cents, poison at seventy-fiv', cents per drink. We have the so-called “red light district” abolished, only to scatter its former inmates all over our cities and towns. We have committees to investigate, which is a very good thing and appreciated; but sure remedies, it seems, are missing. There is nothing stable. Today we have it; tomorrow we have it not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We were told of a “new earth” in order to get us to fight Germany. President Wilson and other notable men traveled through the length and breadth of our country promising the young men of this nation that if they would only join the army they would be permitted when they returned to enter politics and to have a voice in the affairs of the Government such as they had never had and never dreamed of before. The voice of labor was promised , a hearing at all times if we would only consent to this plan of war. But now they Bay: &quot;Back to normalcy.” They do not says &quot;Let us go on to the new earth that we have promised you.” On the contrary they say: “Let vs go back to the conditions before 1914.” They &lt;io not seem to be so anxious now that the voice •f labor shall be heard at all times; they do Mot seem to be so anxious now to reward those who so faithfully served their country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meantime, we have all learned the lesson that God has designed in this matter: namely, that it does not pay any one to seek to destroy his neighbors’ lives. Who, more than our returned soldiers, can say that they have not been rewarded for their service to their country! Propagandists tell us a great deal about charity and what we should do for suffering humanity, but they forget to think about these from the standpoint of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">False standards are fast overthrowing justice. There are a thousand classes, all opposed to each other; there are a thousand publications, all supporting the various fanatical ideas promulgated in the thousands of societies and organizations; and these thousands of schemes are all selfish. There all is confusion; there is little justice. We are headed for the ditch. “But Jesus answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”—Matthew 15:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Like many other admonitions of God’s Word, these words are falling on deaf ears. Oh, that we could through some means call mankind’s attention to those scriptures which speak of the coming calamity as a result of the oppression of the poor, the perverting of judgment, and the unequal distribution of this world’s goods! “If thou seest the oppression of the popr, and the violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is' served by the field.”—Ecclesiastes 5:8,9*&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, 0 inhabitant of the earth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fieeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.”—Isaiah 24:16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christ’s Kingdom —The Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LL sorts of remedies are suggested by all sorts of people. But Christ’s kingdom is God’s sure remedy; for “justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.” (Psalm 89:14) “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.”—Isa. 28:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If there is scant justice in the applying of our laws; if plenty of food does not mean a living for all; if conditions are such that a wife and home are not possible for our young men; if our hundreds of different religious beliefs do not bring peace and a true knowledge and appreciation of God; if our preachers preach politics instead of Bible; if our going-to-church is founded on superstition; if our prosperity depends on selling each other needless articles; if divorce bids fair to outrun matrimony; if our health depends on powders or pills; if by every reform movement we grow worse; if we give a dollar to the hard-working producer and call it charity and not justice; if we would rather have &quot;red-light districts&quot; instead of making marriage possible; if we are going to free all the murderers; if we tar and feather a man who speaks for people’s rights; if dogs are well-fed while human beings go hungry— then are not “all of the foundations of this earth out of course”! &quot;Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a. new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>A Universal Language for the Golden Age </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By lames Denson Bayers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N LOOKING forward to the blessings mankind will enjoy in the Golden Age one may try to speculate about what some of those blessings will be. We can, of course, have only the faintest conception of what they will be ultimately. But can we not safely vision in part, at least, the state of the human race when the incentives to individual, national, religious and racial hatreds shall have forever passed away in a world of peace and plenty and of brotherly love based on perfect understanding! Whatever the perfection attained by other forms of physical well-being, we do know that ignorance and misunderstanding shall pass away and men shall know one another in loving association. In this fraternizing of the whole human family, which we know will be a fact, what will be the means of intercommunication between the peoples who today are so woefully sundered by the nearly five hundred different languages spoken in the world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the Biblical record there was a time when all men spoke one language. Whether the diffusion of different languages was commenced by the miracle of the Tower of Babel, or whether the latter is an allegory given in Holy Writ to symbolize to the understanding of the faithful in later times the modern babel and confusion of Christendom, we can but guess. We do know, however, that the difference of language is a mighty barrier to the brotherhood condition Christ and His saints will soon establish. We know that all obstacles to the establishment of His reign will be overcome and will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How will the obstacle of mutual misunderstanding between the peoples, represented in the present confusion of languages, be erased! Will it be dispensed with miraculously, or will God’s orderly and natural way take its course in the establishment of a common language! Some sincere Christians in the truth believe that in due time God will miraculously turn to His people &quot;a pure language,” while others just as sincere believe that God’s natural law, Which we see performing such wonders every moment, will, within the requisite lapse of time, set forth among men a language common to all nation^ and races.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ told us enough to indicate clearly to the inquiring minds of faith when the time would be drawing near for His presence and the establishment of His reign. We are instructed to look for many things coming on earth that had never been known before. These things are all in one way or another heralding or preparing the way for the setting up of the kingdom. For more than two thousand years ineffectual attempts have been made to establish a common world language, but all attempts either to make a national language the world tongue or to create an artificial language sufficiently practical for international usage failed until just a few years after 1874.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a noteworthy fact that soon after that date a self-sacrificing, kindly Jew, Ludwig L. Zamenhof, began the basic work to which he practically gave his whole life, finally offering freely to the world what great minds had utterly failed to bring forth after life-long attempts— a marvelously practicable and common language for the world, far more perfect than any national language, yet so simple in its structure that it can be learned perfectly by an adult in one-tenth the time required to gain indifferent mastery of a national language. This wonderful language is Esperanto. One may well ask what are some of the reasons for giving consideration to Esperanto as of more than passing interest to those workers heralding the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">First, is it a reasonable expectation that during Christ’s reign on earth all nations will become one people, having a common means of understanding, one language! We believe that all are agreed that this is so, some believing that God will establish a common language miraculously, others believing that some language common to all peoples will grow up naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Second, assuming that Christians would be expecting such a universal language to be brought about, should its appearance not be looked for during the great diffusion of knowledge heralding the presence af Christ! As stated above, Esperanto appeared early during the period of Christ’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Third, on its appearance among the people of this present evil world, over which the prince of darkness holds sway, should we not look for indications that it was not favored but, instead, was and is being hampered by Satan! One of Dr. Zamenhofs heaviest burdens was the ridicule of the worldly-wise and, later, close scrutiny and suspicion from governmental forces. None of the worldly great and rich favored it with their patronage. Governments were appealed to in vain to help its diffusion that the peoples might be brought more closely together and wars made less probable. Large numbers of the common people, poor in worldly riches and power, but rich in the idealism of human love, learned its simple forms and began exchanging letters with one another among all nations of the earth and, beginning in 1^05, held annual world congresses where all nationalities gathered and proved the efficacy of the language by perfect understanding of one another in its usage. Thus the confusion caused by many languages gradually is being swept away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The ‘Internal Idea” of Esperanto, a very real and vital something that can never be fully understood and enjoyed except by one who has become versed in the language and has mingled with Esperantists of foreign national languages, is of a nature closely akin to the love between Christian brethren. As might be expected, Satan, finding one more instrument of welding into reality the brotherhood of mankind being brought forth among the beings suffering under the pall of his dark rule, set about to thwart its purpose. Finding that it could not be destroyed, he brought out imitations of Esperanto. Of these, the only two that gained any considerable following were simply the result of thefts or plagiarisms of an inferior sort of the original, uncopyrighted Esperanto. None of the imitations are spreading among the people of the world with anything like the rapidity of Esperanto. The supporters of the imitations are everywhere violently bitter in their envious opposition to the greater spread of Esperanto. Esperantists go calmly along their self-sacrificing way of teaching the language, trusting that their ideal, being a noble one, will bear fruit of its own inherent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">feood, whatever</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> be the opposition. This is all as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recently some friends in the truth in Europe wrote in Esperanto to the present writer suggesting that\the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society be approached with the proposition of putting the '“Scripture Studies” and other books and tracts into Esperanto in order that many people could be reached with the witness of the truth who otherwise are barred easy access to it. Having heard'Spanish- and Italian-speaking people expressing their great craving that they could have all the volumes and tracts in their languages, we hastened to Judge Rutherford at Bethel Home with the appeal. We were very much surprised to learn that already this past spring and summer Brother Harteva of Finland had fulfilled the commission given him of translating into Esperanto, and was publishing just before the gathering of the 14th Annual World Congress of Esperantists in Helsingfors the book “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” Our joy was heightened when we received from our Esperantists friends in the truth in Europe letters telling of their happiness at having this great message in the international medium and of their confidence in being able to reach with this message of present truth many whom they could in no other manner reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We are assured that very large numbers of people of the languages into which only a portion of the message of present truth has been translated can be reached by means of Esperanto. As the Esperanto literature is not yet nearly full enough to supply the reading demand, new and interesting translations will be purchased and read as much for their Esperanto value as for their content of the truth, thus reaching many who would otherwise miss the message. The translation into Esperanto of “The Harp of God” is now under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it not possible that there are a number of the friends who see in Esperanto one little added means of serving in the great work of heralding the Golden Age and who would like to give a few hours to the study of it? Correspondence with brethren in other parts of the world, either by letters or postal cards, alone brings great joy and profit. This is something that is immediately available after only a few hours of study. Then who knows but that this may prove an expanding field of service? The Lord alone knows what disposition He will make of our services consecrated to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Opportunity to enter an Esperanto class conducted by the writer will be offered to interested persons living in Brooklyn or New York. Others can, with little loss of time from ths other and admittedly greater work, take up the study alone or in groups. The opportunity of spreading the truth is not the only benefit which comes from learning Esperanto; there are other very distinct and varied benefits.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Soldier Bonus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By B. F. Mason *</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UCH is being said pro and eon as to the propriety of the soldier bonus, mostly pro. The vote of four million soldiers, and of perhaps a large number of their friends and relatives, is a factor for politicians who would succeed themselves in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Those politicians and soldiers who urge the bonus, while posing as patriots are, I think, actuated by selfish expedience, though perhaps they do not realize this. Were this tax to be levied on war profiteers, it would be profitable. Were it levied on accumulated wealth, it would not be altogether indefensible. But since our Government derives its funds almost solely from export, import, and internal revenue duties, if the bonus is allowed it must come through a tax imposed on commodities that the people must use. This being true, then the only reason why the tailor earning fifty cents, one dollar or two dollars per day, will not contribute as much toward this fund as does the millionaire, is that while the tailor must stint his family in the use of the bare necessities of life, the millionaire needs not to consider expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From a common-sense view of the facts our soldiers of the World War are not more entitled to a bonus than are the veterans of other wars in which our country has been involved. Indeed, the soldiers in the late war were better cared for and better paid than were those </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">any previous war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I take it that the average American would wish that every citizen injured in the service of his country, and by reason of such service, should be compensated as far as a reasonable stipend could compensate. Every soldier honorably discharged who really wants a job, but who cannot find it, should be employed by the Government in work suited to his capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The funds needed for the compensation of soldiers should be obtained by an ad valorem tax. Although we have no precedent for such a tax in history, yet I think that we should lose no time in making such a precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The statesmen who built and launched the ship of staff were intelligent, educated business men. When It became necessary to finance the government which they had established, they did what business may usually be trusted to do: Instead of levying a tax on the wealth of the classes, they imposed it upon the subsistence of the masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The four billion bonus would cost each man, woman, and child in the United States forty dollars sash. It would cost every family of five two hundred dollars each. Our country already owes twenty billion dollars; the bonus would make it twenty-four billion dollars, or twelve hundred dollars for each family. If twenty years are required to liquidate this debt, then at four percent interest each family will have paid about seventeen hundred dollars. If this sum is wrung from the people by the taxation of commodities, millions will die from starvation and from diseases incident to malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our national wealth has been estimated at one hundred billion dollars. It has been estimated that ninety percent of this wealth is possessed by less than ten percent of our people. If this is true, this ten percent of our people could pay off our debt without depriving themselves of many of the luxuries to which they are accustomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To pay interest on this colossal debt, to provide a sinking fund, and to meet current expenses will probably add twenty percent to the cost of living. This in itself is a crushing burden. But if it were collected automatically day by day, as silently as falls the dew, the victims as a rule do not know what it is that hurts them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">State, county, and municipal taxes add perhaps another ten percent to the cost of living. These taxes are met by excise duties and also by an ad valorem tax on real and personal property. As in the ease of the national tax, people do not seem to realize the excise tax; but the ad valorem tax is irksome, since it must be paid annually and in a lump sum. Moreover, because the manner of assessment is not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> all consistent with true equity, it works a great and undeserved hardship on many individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ad valorem taxes are imposed upon nominal owners of property, while in most cases the nominal owner is not the real owner. For instance, a man buys property, real or personal, makes a small cash payment, and gives mortgage notes for the balance. He must pay tai on this property as well as interest upon the notes. If he fails in either case, he is liable to foreclosure. This is all wrong. Justice would tax the seller on his unpaid notes, secured on the property, and would tax the buyer only to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the extent of his equity in the property. It is not possible to make a dishonest man give an honest estimate of his actual cash; but perhaps a fair value could be approximated by having bankers certify an oath as to the sum of the annual deposits and of the annual withdrawals of each patron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If notes, mortgages, stocks, bonds, etc., were legally invalidated, if not officially stamped annually, these would all be returned for taxation. Verily our legislators seem to accept Satan’s version of our Lord’s dictum: &quot;Unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not ■hall be taken away even that which he hath.” —Matthew 25: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If intelligent humanity were united in support of righteousness, justice would prevail; ■nd happiness would result. “When the right</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">eous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” (Proverbs 29:2) For long centuries &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this planet has been subject to Satan, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>a</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">usurper, and his minions of darkness. The peoples of earth cannot obtain a righteous government until Satan is overthrown by Him to * whom the government belongs by right, the Prince of Peace. (Ezekiel 21:26, 27) Will He comet He </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">has come.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Earth’s empires are crumbling before His irresistible onslaught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our country has been greatly blessed of God. “Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.” (Luke 12:48) Many who have been successful as the world counts success might even yet profit by reading James 5:1-8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ONDON was somewhat excited a few days ago through the arrival in town of some “hunger marchers” who have come up from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">provinces to interview the Prime Minister. Mr. Bonar Law, who is now Prime Minister, refused to see them, and referred them to the Ministry of Labor. The men declared their purpose was to see the Prime Minister, and there was a fear that violence would be used. The government tried to dope the press to lead public opinion against the men by insinuating that its leaders were co</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">unists. Mr. Bonar Law refuses to ■ee the men’s deputation. There is more than one reason for this. Mr. Bonar Law has said he will not follow the way of his predecessor, Mr. Lloyd George, who was ready (at the psychological moment) to take everything into his own hands. But there is also the notion to repress these agitators, and not to pander to them, and there is in Mr. Bonar Law’s refusal something of a challenge of authority against these methods! The fight between authority and the hunger party will come in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The recent general election has brought a good many<sup>1</sup> labor members into the House of Commons, and they feel themselves very strong. Besides having a good deal of physical energy, the labor party has a very considerable measure of intellectual ability in it, but from the politician’s point of view it lacks in this that it has no proposals save a complete redr</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ganization of society. Ultimately, of course, that will be the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">General conditions in the country are fair considering the tremendous amount of unemployment which has obtained for a time. The outlook for trade, both at home and abroad, is poor. It is reported that the Christmas shopping trade in London is not nearly up to expectation: an indication that there is not so much money to spend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In religious circles there is a considerable amount of internal energy, but as to moral force the religious world is impotent: it has no proposals at all. There are neither fruits nor leaves on its trees. The churches have no message for the people, though they are continually endeavoring to stimulate the people to give to the support of their systems. In the English church system there is a movement which has for its object the endeavor to get the church once again into the possession of the faculty of healing. It is claimed by them that the church in the days of its purity could heal the bodies of men &gt;&nbsp;as well as their souls; and Satan is doing something to help them, for now and again there are certain psychological movements which result apparently in some measure of physical healing. Their desire is to bring life into the church by any possible means in order that it may regain its position in the eyes of the people. The Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">student knows that the time for the giving of healing to the body is not yet come, and he knows that anything that anticipates the coming of the kingdom of our Lord is from Satan, who is trying to discount the work of the glorified church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The head of the Liverpool University claims that researches made there gave demonstrations of reaction from inorganic matter which are elosely allied to life, and he suggests that it may be possible to demonstrate how plant life begins. There follows the further suggestion that it may be possible to show how </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">animal</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> life emerges from plant life, and thus the secret of life be disclosed. We shall see. “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.”—Deuteronomy 29:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE political world is rather excited about the Greek executions. The inhuman side of this action is kept to the fore, but the ugly phase is not openly discussed. Politics would be a poor game if all the failures arc to be shot by their successors. It seems as if Isaiah’s word will soon be quite up-to-date. He tells of the time when “a man shall take hold of his brother, of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ruin be under thy hand: In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.’—Isaiah 3:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> GENTLEMAN living in the government of Ufa, Russia, writing to a friend in Portland, Oregon, under date of April 19,1922, reports conditions in his vicinity at that time in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Every thing is very high, a pud (forty pounds) of flour costs twelve million rubles, a pud of potatoes three million rubles, a horse from one to two hundred million rubles, a cow from fifty to sixty million. A pound of butte costs sixty to seventy thousand rubles. The famine is great, many thousands axe dying, no &lt;me has grain for seed. We are getting a little from Soviet Government, so that we can put in about twenty-five </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ittj </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(about sixty acres). Last year we had 130 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is terrible. The people kill human beings, and eat them, and make sausage of them.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gospel Of Dirt </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By F. Leon Scheerer</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">homas Caklylk, a leading essayist and historian, was born in 1795 and died in 1881. Not long before his death Carlyle, who knew Darwin well, wrote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I have known three generations of Darwins—grandfather, father, and son—atheists all. The brother of the famous naturalist, a quiet man who lives not far from here, told me that among his grandfather’s effects he found a seal engraven with this legend </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Omni ex con-chis’</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> (everything from a clam shell) t I saw the naturalist not many months ago, told him I had read his 'Origin of Species’ and other books, that he had by no means satisfied me that we were descended from monkeys, but that he had gone far to persuade me that he and his so-called scientific brethren had brought the present generation very near to monkeys. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“A good sort of man is this Darwin, and well-meaning, but with little intellect. It is a sad and terrible thing to see nigh a whole generation of men and women, professing to be cultivated, looking around in a purblind fashion, and finding no God in the universe. I suppose it is a reaction from the reign of cant and hollow pretense, professing to believe what in fact they do not believe. And this is what we have got to — all things from frog spawn — the gospel of dirt, that is the order of the day. The older I grow — and now I stand on the brink eternity — the more comes back to me the sentence in the Catechism, which I learned when a child, and the fuller and deeper its &quot;waning becomes: 'What is the chief end of man? To glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.’ No gospel of dirt, -teaching that men have descended from frogs through monkeys, can ever ret that aside.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Animal and Human Vivisection</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROM an address by Walter H Hadwen, M. D., M. R., C. S., of Gloucester, England, at a public meeting in Los Angeles, June 16, 1921, stenographically reported for and published by the California Antivivisection Society, 622 Bryson Building, Los Angeles, California, we quote in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;You are sitting by your fireside one evening and your terrier is lying at your feet. Suddenly the little fellow starts, pricks his ears and utters a low growl. What has happened? Why, the little terrior has heard • footstep on the garden path long before you have heard it. Why ? Because its sense of hearing is so much more acute than your own. Yeur puss is lying on your lap. Suddenly it starts to the wainscoting. It has heard the sound of a mouse which hasn’t reached your ears. Look at the sleuth-hound and watch it on the trail. See it as it tracks its quarry </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">e, after mile. Why is It that the sleuth-hound can follow the trail like that? Because its sense of smell is so much more developed than your own. You notice those little specks away up there in the sky. You can hardly perceive them, but you notice them gathering in innumerable flocks. What does it mean? There is a body lying out upon the desert plain, and the birds of prey are waiting yonder until death has closed the scene and they can swoop down upon the carcass. Why is it that they are able to see from that enormous distance what you cannot perceive at all ? Because their sense of vision is so much keener than your own. You are riding a high-bred horse. You give him but the slightest touch with the end of your whip. Notice how he dashes forward. Why ? Because his sense of feeling is so marvellously acute. If in these lower animals the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of vision, and the sense of feeling, can be so much more acute than our own, what right has anyone to say that their sense of pain is not also equally acute simply because they cannot express toemsalves in articulate language? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Day after day these poor creatures are eking out their lives in their cages in these vivisectors’ dens throughout the ‘civilized’ world. You have hundreds of them in your midst — in the Rockefeller Institute, for instance. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rockefeller Hell</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> I call it, which is supported by the Rockefeller millions What are they doing there? What did Dr. Carrel do the other day? Take a 'kidney out frcan the side of a dog, place the kidney up ih its neck, make the ureter (the tube between kidney and bladder) pass down the gullet to see whether it could function there as well as in the position where Nature had placed it. Do you or any human being in the United States of America want to have your kidney put into your neck? If not, what on earth is thiS experiment done for, and why on earth is a so-called scientist allowed to do it? It is all very well to say that these animals do not suffer. Do you mean to tell me that in protracted experiments of this description — even supposing the primary operation was done under an anaesthetic — that pain and suffering are a mere chimera during the days and the weeks and the months which follow ? Those weeks and months during which the hard eyes of the vivisector watch the animal as the creature lingers on? Dr. B</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lair</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bell (who has been recently entertained by his vivisectionist colleagues in the United States), one of the noted vivisectors in England, thought he would try to discover the properties of the pituitary gland, which lies in the brain. (Some of the ancients deemed it to be the location of the soul). So he opened the skull of a dog and fixed a wax tumor on the brain and closed up the scalp, and then he published a picture of that dog ninetyeight days after the operation was performed — a poor, miserable, wretched, deformed creature, distorted in every limb, presenting a most horrible sight. I remember when my friend, Sir George Greenwood, late member of Parliament, saw the picture, he said that he was so horribly shocked he could not sleep all night afterwards. This is but an instance of the day-after-day slow torture of a sentient animal supposedly to solve some scientific riddle. Was anything discovered by it? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nothing whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Take those experiments of Sir John Rose Bradford upon thirty-nine fox terriers — taking out one kidney and cutting away the o£&gt;er kidney piecemeal in order to see how long toe intelligent little female terrier dogs could live with as little kidney as possible. He was asked, in cross-examination by the Royal Commission on Vivisection: ‘What was it you learned by that?* He hesitated and said: ‘Well, we did discover that dogs didn’t suffer from any disease akin to h</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uma</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">n Bright’s disease.’ He states himself, with his own pen, that some of these dogs died from blood poisoning, some from -diarrhoea, some of them from hemorrhage; and that they all suffered from fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Look at these experiments of Dr. Crile, another (American) doctor. He came over to my country and experimented on dogs in order to try to ascertain the physiological effect of shock, and in order to do that he had to produce shock by artificial means in these poor creatures. There were 148 dogs altogether, many of them, probably, the stolen pets of happy homes. He tarred some of them over, and then set them on fire. He cut some of them open, took out their entrails and poured boiling water into the cavity He took their paws and held them over Bunsen flames. He deliberately crushed toe most sensitive organs of the male. He poked out their eyes, and then worked a tool around the empty socket. He crushed every bone in their paws with a mallet This was toe vile work that was carried on in England under toe license of toe vivisector; and some of the very worst of the work was done in your own country, where no license is required. Get Crile’i own book on ‘Surgical Shock,’ and you may see the facts for yourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Now, supposing, for instance, you have some rabbits, and you turn them loose into a field of belladonna and allow them to eat freely of the belladonna. You find that your rabbits will thrive and become as plump as possible. Would you say to yourself: ‘Tommy looks 01 and Nancy looks </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—look at these rabbits, how plump they have become! I think I shall give Tommy and Nancy a belladonna porridge for breakfast?’ There would soon be a coroner’s inquest. A goat eats hemlock and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">grows</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> fat on it. Would you, therefore, argue that hemlock would be a first-rate thing for the physical condition of the human race ? If so, it would be a very serious thing for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Take that important drug, morphia, the active principle of opium, which no medical man would care to be without. Would you experiment upon a dog to find out how much to give your patient? I suppose one grain would be sufficient to put any one in this audience to death, and yet Professor Hobday, the celebrated veterinary surgeon, told the Royal Commission that he had never been able to poison more b' than one dog in his life with morphia, and he had given as much as thirty-seven grains without any fatal effect. Why, a .little pigeon can take twelve grains of mcrphia and then fly away as happy as a skylark. Would yrn argue from a pigeon to man? Take again the question ox a hedgehog. Why, do you know that a hedgelug can take as much opium as a Chinaman would smoke in a fortnight and wash it down with as much prussic acid as would kill a whole regiment of soldiers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Dr Preston King announced in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lancet</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> some time ago that we were groping in the dark by experimenting with animals; that we are waiting for the light which only experimentation upon human beings will bring; therefore, he said, criminals ought to be handed over in order that vivisectors might experiment upon them. It is a fr</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ank</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> admission that animal experimentation is a failure, and that only experimentation upon human beings can yield scientific results. It demands a reversal to the barbarism of the Middle Ages when torture was used upon alleged criminals fox the purpose of wresting from them secrets which it was thought could be obtained in no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparation of Inoculation Material</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“They take what is called 'typhoid germs,’ put them Into beef broth, or some such proteid material, and keep them in a warm place until they multiply by the million, and the whole of the beef broth becomes alive with them. Then they cook this emulsion of germs by boiling it, until they make a kind of typhoid germ soup. The germa are cultivated in the first place from mmples obtained'from human excreta; and when this decoction of germ corpses is fully prepared, it is pumped into the human body to protect it against typhoid fever! They take so-called diphtheria cultures from the throat of a child suffering from diphtheria, ■ad put that also into beef broth or some proteid material until they have grown these germs by the million. Then they inject the emulsion into a horse. The horse becomes poisoned, suffers from diarrhoea, from fevei and from the results of blood poisoning; but they go on and on for several months gradually increasing the quantity until the horse becomes 'immune’; they take a quart or two every few days of that poor horse’s blood, allow it to coagulate, collect the serum which rises to the surface and then pour it off into tubes at a dollar or two apiece for inoculating into your child for the cure Of diphtheria! </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Of all the senseless, superstitious, filthy, absurd things ever imagined in the brain ef mortal man this antitoxin or serum business talces the bun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“What is the result? In my own country during the fifteen years after antitoxin was introduced, the death rate from diphtheria arose twenty-five percent above the death rate of fifteen years before; and bacteriologists can only attempt to show a reduction in fatality by a scandalous system of statistical jugglery, whereby large numbers of common sore throats are thrown into the count and called diphtheria on the basis of the fallacious germ theory of disease. Diphtheria serum has killed without a doubt thousands of children, directly, though it has never had the slightest effect in preventing or curing diphtheria itself, and I challenge anybody to prove that it has ever saved one single life! It is based upon superstition, it is built upon unscientific theories, it is manufactured at the expense and the torture of animal life, and it is the greatest disgrace to the medical profession that the world has witnessed in the course of the centuries!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The practice of inoculation against smallpox cams to England in 1721 through Turkey. It was recommended to Royalty by Lady Wortley Montague, the wife of the English Ambassador at the Ottoman Court; and it was pressed among the English people for eighty years. They found at the end of eighty years that smallpox was worse than it was before, and the medical profession was at its wit’s end to know what to do. I* was at this juncture that Edward Jenner appeared on the scene with the narration of a dairymaid’s superstition of his district that ‘a person who has had cowpox would never have smallpox.’ The cow doctors of the time laughed at him, and told him it was only a bit of silly folk-lore; but Jenner took no notice of disproofs. He frankly and distinctly says that he was on the lookout for something that would make him a fortune. He took hie pathology straight from the dairymaids and argued thus: If cowpox prevents smallpox, cowpox must be smallpox of the cow. Now, let’s give everybody cowpox instead of inoculating them with smallpox. Cowpox isn’t infectious, and it protects a person forever against the disease.’ He incorporated these claims in a petition to Parliament for a reward for his so-called 'discovery,’ and he got thirty thousand pounds from a grateful government for that sublime idea. You know how a certain class of people and thaia money are soon parted, and the superstition became respectable and scientific. It was soon discovered that cowpox was no protection at all, but the government had paid such a big price for it that they had to uphold it to save their credit. When Jenner’s party found that the inoculators still went on pushing their trade in opposition to his, they applied to the government to put a stop to their rivals, and an Act was passed inflicting a month’s imprisonment upon anybody who inoculated, and ordering that everybody should be vaccinated. So, to save their faces and to comply with the sordid demands of medical greed, compulsory vaccination commenced, and the world has been under the heel of its idiocy and despotism ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“In reply to a question in the British House of Commons, put just before I left England, the Minister of Health stated officially that from the year 1908 to 1920 there had been only twenty-five children under five years old die from smallpox in the whole United Kingdom, but that no less than 111 had died from the effects of vaccination. Those figures are certified by qualified medical men. Four times as many are certified as dying from vaccination as died from smallpox, and you may be sure that this does not represent the whole of the terrible toll from vaccination; for medical men are not going to convict themselves of manslaughter if they can help it Such facts are enough to damn this absurd superstition for all time and to shake to the foundation the whole vaccine and inoculation theory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“In the case'-of your soldiers, vast numbers of them never did a stroke for their country; but after they were inoculated had to go straight to hospitals and stay there until they were invalided home, cast upon the country as wrecks for life — some of them killed outright by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“They told us the other day that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">experimenting upon dogs, heart disease had been so wonderfully remedied that we had saved $250,000 a year to the country in pensions. I got a member of Parliament to ask the Minister of Pensions if it were true. It was a statement made by a medical man in the House of Commons. The Minister said he did not know anything at all about it, but that $20,000,000 a year are being paid in pensions to soldiers for heart disease alone. These men were all healthy when they enlisted. They went out in all the vigor of manhood, full of life and seal, to' fight for their country, and their country’s honor; and now they are robbed of health, slowly dying with heart disease. I have had a number of these men under my own care. Not one single disease had they suffered from upon the battlefield. I could trace that heart <sup>l</sup>disetae to nothing but the vile inoculations with whichtmedical officers had injected them. It has produced affections of the heart, of the brain, of the kidney, of the lungs, and of other organa. Inoculation has given disease to thousands upon thousands of our </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">brave men who west out strong and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">healthy and full ci spirit to fight for their country, but were knocked </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">over, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not by German shell and shrapnell, but by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">poisoned lancet of their own military medical officers under the influence of this degrading superstition, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rendered not only unfit for war but unfit for peace. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">terrible scandal to think that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">superstition </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">like </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this should place the whole country at tike mercy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">little coterie of medical cranks and faddists who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the health and the very lives of our brave men in their hands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To the same source, that is, the California Antivivisection Society, we are indebted for further data upon the subject of vivisection, accompanied by illustrations showing dogs, monkeys, and children in process of being butchered. The information upon which the Antivivisection Society bases its statements comes mainly from the assertions of vivisee-tionists themselves, as published from time to time in the medical journals. The republication of the declarations of these physicians as to the liberties which they have taken with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">animal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and human life cannot properly be regarded as evil speaking. These men are proud of their experiments, or they would not publish the accounts of them. Furthermore, no law can be invoked against any of these physicians, despite the fact that some of the acts enumerated will seem to people of refined sensibilities as cruel beyond power of words to describe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the cuts published by the Antivivisection Society is an illustration of the Pawlow method of getting gastric juice, used in the laboratory of biological chemistry of Columbia University, New York city. We reproduce this cut herewith. Holes are cut in the throats and stomachs of these dogs. When they attempted to eat, often for hours at a time, the food never reaches the stomach, but falls out of the opening at the throat These wretched dogs finally die of slow starvation, in addition to the intense suffering caused by the wounds and corrosive action of the gastric juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Several of the medical schools have homemade apparatus for the vivisecting of animals, among them a device for breaking the backs of animals without killing them. There is, however, a German concern, Lautenschlager ofl Berlin, Germany, which makes a specialty of supplying all kinds of apparatus of this sort, among them a device for scientifically prying apart the jaws of a dog and keeping the distended jaws rigidly fixed in one position so that no harm can come to the vivisector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the vivisecting of animals to the vivisecting of children would seem like a long step, yet the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archives of Pediatrics</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> show that Dr. L. E</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ett Holt, Professor of diseases of children in the College of Physicians and Surgeons •f Columbia University, New York, performed about a thousand experiments upon babies, most of them consisting of the injection of tuberculin into the eye. These injections of tuberculin not only were made into the eyes of children that were • healthy, but were also made into the eyes of those who were dying. The professional statement showing that the tuberculin was injected into the eyes of dying children is as follows: “In no cases were positive reactions obtained among dying children or those suffering from extreme prostrations.” The report sho-ws that the hands of all these children were confined for twelve hours after the tuberculin was injected into their eyes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archives of Internal Medicine,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> published by the American Medical Association, shows that one hundred sixty orphan children of the St. Vincent Orphan Home of Philadelphia also had tuberculin injected into their eyes by Doctors McC. Hamil, Carpenter, and Cope. This resulted in the permanent impairment of sight of some of these children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal of Experimented Medicine pi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Rockefeller Institute, 1916, Dr. U. J. Wille of the University of Michigan, with the consent of Dr. Edmund A. Christian, in charge of the state hospital for the insane, bored holes into the skulls and extracted brain matter from, numerous </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">inm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ates for the purpose of inoculating rabbits with the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, of the Rockefeller Institute, gives his own account of how he inoculated 400 individuals, 46 of whom were normal and 100 others, chiefly diildren suffering from diseases of a non-syphilitio nature, with a preparation of the germs of syphilis. The 400 unsuspecting victims of Noguchi’s experiments were all furnished through “the courtesy and collaboration,” as he expresses it, of twenty of the leading hospitals of New York, the names of which and the doctors in charge are all given. Dr. Noguchi also tells us that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Welch, ex-President of the American Medical Association, suggested to him that he use human beings instead of animals for his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The reason why tuberculin and other viruses are injected into the children of the poor is explained as follows by Schiefflein &amp;&nbsp;Company of New York, who proudly claim that “every lot of vaccine virus prepared by the Lederle Antitoxin Laboratories is physiologically tested on children, thus insuring an active and potent product.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But even with all the efforts that are made to keep the vaccines harmless, great difficulty is experienced in actually making them so. Thus, at Dallas, Texas, in the winter of 1919, ten children were killed and forty others maimed and crippled for life as a result of the use of toxin-antitoxin as a preventive of diphtheria. The survivors of this tragedy were described as having “endured drendful agony—with legs and arms drawn and disfigured, horrible ulcers and open discharging sores, rotting flesh falling from parts of their bodies until the bones were exposed and eyes twisted and crossed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This death - dealing preventive toxin - antitoxin (series No. A 377061) was manufactured by the great and reliable H. K. Mulford Company, and its absolute “purity and safety” was triply certified to by the U. S. Government, the . H. K. Mulford Company&quot;, and the health authorities of the City of Dallas—it had thus passed the “threefold bacteriological inspection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The aftermath was marked by the holding of mass meetings of the citizens of Dallas, and the filing of many suits for damages against the H. K. Mulford Company, who expressed their &quot;regrets for the accident,” and finally to avoid further publicity paid a large sum of money to the families of the victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The public health reports for September and November, 1918, obtainable by anybody, from the Department of Public Documents, Washington, D.C., show that America’s robust young soldiers, the flower of physical perfection, after inoculations and vaccinations with the various soups, syrups, vaccines, viruses, and other poisons, had a death rate 4.6 times as high as the civil population of the country, with all kinds of treatment or no treatment and with its large percentage of feeble, old, and diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bureau of Animal Industry, Circular No. 147</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farmers’ Bulletin No. 666,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the United States Government Department of Agriculture, obtainable from the same Department of Public Documents, show that the epidemics of foot-and-mouth diseases which swept the United States in 1902, 1903, 1908, and 1914 were due to vaccine viruses; and that from-1902 to 1908, and probably to 1914, thousands of school children were vaccinated with viruses containing germs of foot-and-mouth disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The report of special inquiry by New York Health Board Department, published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> June 12, 1916, shows that, contrary to general belief, the almost universal use of antitoxin for diphtheria has not reduced the number of cases nor deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports of House of Parliament proceedings show that nearly 70,000 British soldiers vaccinated for typhoid immunity were sent home from Gallipoli Peninsula with tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sir Robert Bell, for forty-three years cancer specialist in London Hospital, states that cancer and tuberculosis are traced by specialists to blood debasement from vaccinations and serums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Board of Health Report of New York City shows that cancer has increased fully 225 percent since 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Rupert Blue, allopathic Surgeon-General, U. S. Health Service, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Senate Report No. 147,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> August 15, 1919, makes the statement that &quot;we are still without any specific treatment for tuberculosis, and without any means of increasing individual resistance by the use of serums or vaccines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman Catholic Church, which has had something to say on almost every subject, and which because of its belief in torture here and hereafter is more often wrong than right in its every position, is not a unit on the subject of vaccination. Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia, who has acquired eminence in the papal system, partly as a result of his enthusiastic and successful efforts at burning Bibles in the Philippines, is a firm believer in vaccination, giving all the standard arguments in favor of it. On the other hand, Cardinal Manning, the Church of England clergyman who turned Roman Cathohc, was on the other side of the question. He not only asked the prayers of his nuns for the cessation of the practice, but declared : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I publicly renew my firm determination </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> long M life is granted me, to assist in putting an end to that which I believe to be a detestable practice without scientific results, and immoral in itself. ... I believe the time has come, and I only </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wish we </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had the power </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">le</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">gally, to prohibit the practice of vivisection. Nothing can justify, no claim of science, no conjectural result, no hope of discovery, such horrors as these. Also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">must be remembered that whereas these torments, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fined and indescribable, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">certain, the result is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">alto</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">gether conjectural — everything about the result is uncertain but the certain infraction of the first laws of mercy and humanity.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Is Vaccination Inhuman? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Walter F. Moser</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ANY strange theories are advanced in this present age, and the concrete facts are often neglected. It is useless to argue, in the face of the appalling increase in the death rate that vaccination is a benefit. The following observation in the Philippines is noteworthy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Three epidemics occurred in these islands, the first being before 1905, in which it resulted that ten percent of the smallpox cases proved fatal. But no systematic vaccination was carried on at that time. In the first real epidemic of recent years, that which occurred in 1905-6, at which time vaccination was well under way, the death rate was sixteen percent In 1908-9, when vaccination was more extensively used, the mortality was more than twenty-five percent; during the recent outbreak of 1918-19 the rate of death was over sixty-five percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These figures will bear investigation and can be seen in the report of the Philippine Health Service for 1919 and can be considered an authorized record. Under U. S. Government supervision, the Filipinos have been vaccinated and revaccinated and surely the system has had an opportunity to become very thoroughly tested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In conclusion, I turn to circular No. 147 of the Bureau of Animal Industry and Farmer’s Bulletin No. 666. These contain proof by the U. S. Government that the epidemics of foot and mouth disease which swept this country in 1902-03, 1908, and 1914 were started from vaccine virus. The same circular No. 147, pages 24-26, states that from 1902 to 1908 and very probably to 1914, thousands of school children were vaccinated under compulsion with virus containing the germs of foot and mouth disease, with a resultant debasement of the blood which may, in after years, result in complications of a very serious nature. It is high time the public awaken to the dangers of vaccine virus, and absolutely refuse to have their bodies violated under so-called health laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Standing at the portal of the opening year, Words of comfort meet us, hushing every fear; Spoken through the silence by our Father’s voice, Tender,-strong and faithful, making us rejoice. For the year before us, oh, what rich supplies! For the poor and needy, living streams shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rise; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">For the sad and mournful, shall His grace abound J For the faint and feeble, perfect strength be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible Is the Textbook </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By a 16-year-old Schoolboy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE is in this country and in Europe a class of highly imaginative people who •re overstepping the extent of ordinary daydreams and are becoming a menace to the growing generation by their diffusion of harmful and ignorant teachings. In Zion City, Illinois, Wilbur Glenn Voliva is filling the minds of innocent school children with the misinformation that “the world is a flat disk, surrounded by ice; the Sun is only twenty-six miles in circumference and moves around the Earth, which stands still.” Now I place the question before the thousands of mothers and fathers who send their children to school: Should Voliva be allowed to continue his wild teachings! Has not the fact that the Earth is a sphere been established for 500 years, ever since the days of Galileo! Do we not see proofs of the Earth’s motion through space every day ! Without this motion should we not be in perpetual ■unlight, and would it not be the same season of the year all the time! These and many other reasons which prove the utter nonsense of Voli-va’s theories should be sufficient to cause him to be regarded as a public menace; for when the children now under his tutelage grow up •nd impart their fairy-tale knowledge to their ehildren, shall we, not have a nation of simpletons in a few generations! Certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The term Christian Science is synonymous with Spiritualism, New Thought, Power of Will, Mental Healing, Mental Telepathy, and nonsense in general Christian Science is neither Christian nor scientific. The word science simply means accuracy, and is not to be used to describe every idea which enters befogged brains. The Christian Scientists look upon tho Bible as another Koran. They suppose it to have been written for Mrs. Eddy only. If • person gets his mind in proper condition, so they say, he can make himself God. God, they say, is but “a force, inherent in our subcon- -scions intellectual processes and which can be brought to our use by contemplative study of the Infinite.” (Quotation from book on mental healing.) When a person sufFering from this mental affliction of Christian Science attacks you, beat it. If you do not want a headache for two weeks from listening to phrases “indivisible all in all subconscious homogeneousness of will power,” if you wish to save your ear drums from being worn out by &quot;relativistic oneness,” if you do not care to be bored to distraction and led to deeds of violence, remember that pressing engagement of yours when friend Scientist begins to spout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And now for one more of modern intellectual parasites, and his case is the easiest to diagnose. Do you know </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">! He’s the blindfolded and hocus-pocused disciple of the illustrious Darwin. Charles Darwin’s remarkable power of writing in a convincing manner is to his credit; but down in his heart Darwin knew that the Creator of this universe, and of the planets and other celestial bodies therein, did not run about on four hairy legs and swing by his tail from tree to tree. Darwin knew also that the Being who said: &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26) did not squeak and chatter when He gave the words to Moses to write down, which form the basis of our twentieth-century laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Darwin was misled by the striking similarity of the ape to the human; but scientists have proven that there is no link between us and them. Picture to yourself the evolution of, for instance, your grandfather forty thousand times removed. The grand old gentleman was possessed of a magnificent tail, which he waved most captivatingly before the mistress of his heart, whom he admired because of her beautiful fur. They wed and lived happily together for several mesozoical eras (See Darwin again), leaving behind them several children, with just as fine fur, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shorter tails!</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> This process of tail reduction, continuing for about 60,000 years longer (See Darwin), produced at last the present human being; and per Charles D., the slight projection of our spines beyond the lowest vertebra is the sole remnant of our once beautiful tails! Long may they have waved! And the fur—well, that’s another story I For those wishing to know whether or not the Bible agrees with Darwin on this point, I cite the following: The first chapter of Genesis, also chapter 2:5, 6, 7, and Revelation 1:10, IL</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Jehovah or Darwin: Which? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Thomas </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">r.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Smith</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DO not tackle this subject with any presumptuous spirit. I realize that I have the scholarship of the world against me. David’s prayer comes up from my heart as naturally as the spring from the mountain’s base: “Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins.” If I can get only a little pebble out of the brook of truth as David did, with God’s help I may be able to slay this scholarly giant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s two great lies have captured the world. He has worked that immortal soul lie into all but one of the religions and philosophies of this earth. He has also put the Darwinian lie into nearly all the scholarship of the world. I suppose Satan can work better through human pride than through poverty. It was the scholarly, priestly pride of the Jewish nation that crucified Christ; and if He were to come back now, the modern scholarly, priestly class would do this again if they could. As proof of this, read Acts 9:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In his book “The Origin of Species,” Darwin tries to make out that the law of evolution </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">created,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> evolved, and brought man up through the different species to the monkey, or ape; and that man is the descendant of the ape. It appears to me that Darwin’s basic claim that any law can create is but the fabric of an absurdity. Law impliessa creator of some sort, and the law of evolution ip no exception to the general rule. All the laws of the universe combined could not create even one germ of life of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is plain to see that the aim of the Darwinian theory is to discredit the Bible account •f creation and to thrust Jehovah out of this earth which He has created. Satan is an adept or past master in counterfeiting. In this case, he has taken the law of evolution and exalted it into a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">creative force,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by a new name with a scientific sound —&quot;Universal Force”— he has accomplished the trick to the satisfaction of at least a majority of modern scholars, the trick of turning the Bible into a book of fables. As a result Jehovah’s personality has become a myth to many modern scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan has counterfeited not only Jehovah, but also Christ and His church. The Church of Rome and the Pope are the counterfeit. Satan has also a counterfeit for every doctrine held by the true church. The Bible doctrine of a millennium of a thousand years of free cleansing is counterfeited by the Romish purgatory, from which no one gets out except by masses said and money paid to priests. The doctrine of justification by faith is counterfeited by works and penance. The doctrine of holiness is counterfeited by sinless perfection. The fact is, Satan is the great original counterfeiter who has always opposed Jehovah’s teachings. It is his usual method of working evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a question that keeps coming up in my mind. Like Banquo’s ghost, &quot;It will not down.” It is this: Why is it that these scholarly so-called scientific men are so steadfastly persistent in claiming the monkey or the big ape as their grandpa! It seems to be their pride and pleasure to do so, and nothing less than that will satisfy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another question naturally comes up at this time: Has this Darwinian theory been bena&gt; ficial or hurtful to the world! God is looking into my heart while I am writing this article, and He knows that I am actuated only by a aineere purpose to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I certainly affirm that wherever accepted, the Darwinian theory of evolution, has, to a large extent, surely made the world more cruel than it was before. In my early youth I lived in a German community settled largely by them, and found them as kindly disposed and peaceful people as could be found. But there is no doubt that during the last fifty years as a nation they have changed and have showed cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You may desire to know the reason why 1 think so. My reason is this: Their clergy of the Lutheran Church, and also their rich men and nobles who could pay for a college education, took a larger dose of the Darwinian theory of evolution than the same classes of other nations. There is no theory or system of teaching that will drive the Christ life of self-denial and sympathy for suffering out of the churches, and thus out of the nation, so completely as will the evolution theory of Darwin. It is painful to believe that there was a nation in the world that sank fifteen hundred men, women, and children, all non-combatants, in the Lusitania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All men have a theology of some sort — some in written creeds, and some in unwritten creeds. There may be more or less truth in all their theologies; perhaps about an ounce of truth to a bushel of error. But any theory, however plausible or scientific it may seem, that would drive out the Bible and the God of love, the Author of that old true and tried Book of our Fathers, I for one can have no part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is evolution in the Bible, but there is no Darwinism in it In the first Psalm you will perceive the evolution of both good and evil: &quot;Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel [advice] of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners [familiar with, as one of them], nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful [fully at home with them] ; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.” It is by the study of God’s law — the Bible — that the evolution into spirituality and goodness begins that evolves finally into heavenly immortality. Then it becomes fixed forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Darwin and his adherents make two fatal mistakes that vitiate and destroy his whole theory: When he asserts or implies that the law of evolution creates'any form of life, he is building on a false foundation. When he asserts that the law of evolution continues, and that the species never become fixed, that is another false assertion. When he assumes that the law of evolution produces in man a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mind </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">with all its varied qualities, he makes another fatal blunder. All laws, no matter of what kind they may be, are a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">product</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of mind. So Darwin again fatally blunders. If I may use a common figure of speech, “He puts the cart before the horse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The real fact is, the Darwinian theory is unscientific and a blunder as well. There never was, and what is more, there never will be an unbroken line of evolution. The very fact that scientists are continually looking for the supposed missing link in their chain of evolution, shows their belief in continuous evolution. When any created thing having life arrives at perfection, the law of evolution ceases. It cannot operate on anything perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first chapter of Genesis you will find Jehovah’s creative acts carried out through the &quot;Logos.” Beginning at the third day’s work of creation: &quot;God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” (Genesis 1:11) Here we have both the creative act and the working of the law of Bible evolution — not Darwin’s false evolution. Here God created the life that developed or evolved into the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perfect fruit tree;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and when it became perfect the species became fixed. This explanation of the work of the three creative days explains the work of the other two days, in the creation of fish or animal life — each species, as it became perfect, became fixed, each after its kind; for evolution had ceased in $ach case. This very fact contradicts Darwin’s theory of continuous evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice that at the end of each creative day God always pronounced His work good; and God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> is ever perfect. This Darwinian theory makes a Christless church, and also a Christless world; and a Christless ehurch and world will both be cruel. The old theology of the Bible, which tells of the future &quot;Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man,” is not improved, but is degraded by the new scholarly ape-ology of the Darwinian evolutionists, with their fatherhood of apes and brotherhood of monkeys. There is no inspiration, neither ia there any uplift in such a beastly theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This belief works another great evil in men: It fills the heart with pride, especially if the title “Professor” or “Reverend” is added to their names. It also swells their heads with vanity; and a heart and a head filled with pride and vanity make Godless men. You will notice that the evolution theory of Darwin is Godless, Christless, and prayerless. It is the only religious system that I know of that is prayerless. God has laid a necessity for prayer in humanity’s needs and wishes. It should be as natural to pray as it is to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Now you ape-ologists may resent my well-intentioned effort to supply you with a prayer to fill up the lack in your prayerless system; but, anyway, here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Our Father Ape, who art up in a tree, tend down more cocoannte, oranges, apples, and other fruits needed by thy evolutionary children to help them on the way to spiritual life, and receive our thanks. Amen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When I was in the ministry, I wrote under the cognomen of “Rev. Tom Plaintruth” articles for religious journals. Since I came to get a better knowledge of the Bible, I cut the sacrilegious title of “Reverend” out, as a Satanic insinuation making for a proud heart and a swelled head. So I now write as Tom Plaintruth to you Darwinian Ape-ologists, with no harmful intent, but to speak the truth without fear or favor. The logical goal of the Darwinian Ape-ology is “the survival of the fittest&quot;; and this theory would eventually weaken and eat the heart out of all efforts of humanity to raise the downtrodden or distressed, to help the sick, or to seek improvement in any way. Cain's interrogation of the Lord, &quot;Am I my brother's keeper!” was really an affirmation that he was not responsible for AbeL Cain’s goal and the ape-ologist’s goal is the same. Both seek to throw off and escape from all responsibility for their brother. The opposite course is taught in the parable of the good Samaritan.—Luke 10: 25-37.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>War and Religion </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By John Dawson</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE is considerable discussion going on at the present time in the forum of the daily press relative to the harmony between war and religion. Opinions are divided. Many of those expressing their views are of the opinion that it is the duty of a citizen to defend his country, even going as far as to sacrifice his life. This has been the view of the large majority for centuries. When I say it has been the view, I do not mean that everyone is by nature a militarist ; but when circumstances arose and demanded that the ordinary law-abider take up arms to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">kill,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of two evils he chose the lesser. The gibes and sneers of the boys and girls are more than the average young man can stand; and when, added to this, the local preacher expresses the view that it is quite the thing for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">other</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> fellow to face the music, what can the young fellows dof Here is a situation that tests the mettle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the^easiest thing in the world when the call to arms comes to shoulder a musket and go with the crowd. To follow the crowd is always easy. Any fool can do it; but it takes a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to face the crowd. For eight heart-breaking years now, the mettle of a good many has been tested; and the faith of many is being shaken. Like the theories and ideas and philosophies which are now being tested out, so the faith of the world is being tested out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An old lady of the writer’s acquaintance, a lady who knows the Bible from cover to cover, said one day, speaking of the trouble, that she wondered if there were a God at all, or if her Bible were true. Herein lies the preacher’s responsibility. How many people who regularly attend church are infidels, having lost faith in the Word of God! And how many are just plain hypocrites f And how many are taking their religion seriously, and endeavoring to shape their course in life to conform to their opinions and to their faithf This is indeed the time when faith is being shaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But, regarding the difference of opinion in respect to war and religion; on the other side are some </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">seriously inclined to believe</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that to be a Christian a person should not have anything to do with war. They are quite right; but the pity of it is that through the lack of knowledge due either to the preacher’s negligence or to the individual's inattention, or to both, they are not sure that a Christian should have nothing to do with war. They are just seriously inclined to this belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of course this is a step in the right direction; but is it not strange that after the Old Testament has been in existence for a few thousand years, and the New Testament for eighteen hundred years, people are beginning at this late period to be seriously inclined to believe that a Christian should have nothing to do with wart A person sometimes wonders just what the preachers have been doing with their time, their influence, and their learning, together with the unlimited opportunities they have had to study their Bibles. One of the great troubles in the world has been the idea that religion is just a system of thought or a philosophy. This is why there are so many sects and parties, each and all taking the Bible as the foundation for their belief; and in days gone by, the difference led to the most horrible excesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the individual’s life the practical application of the teaching of Jesus in His sermon on the mount has been overlooked. Jesus said: “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.” The war profiteers went the limit in heaping treasure together for these last days, and acted as though they thought the more war there is, the better it is for the Christian (!) profiteers! Now their garments are moth-eaten, their gold and silver are cankered, and the rust of them is a witness against them.—James 5:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The time is not far distant when it will be dangerous for a man to be a millionaire; and then “a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold ... to the moles and to the bats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.” (Isaiah 2: 20, 21) Then the profiteer will likely have the crust to call for an investigation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For many years now scholars have been talking about the brain age and evolution and the power of mind over matter. The trouble with these scholars is, however, that their findings are regarded as mere theories. Take the theory of evolution, for instance. A person who believes that he ik descended from the monkeys cannot altogether be blamed if once in a while he cuts up a little monkey-shine. The monkeys like to do what they see others do. The monkey lees the boys with their muskets on their shoulders; and since he is only a monkey, you know, he follows the crowd. &quot;What else could he do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Regarding the power of mind over matter, take the ease of war, either between nations, or between individuals. The human body is the dwelling place of the mind. The will is the controlling force and should be directed by' the mind. Speech and action are the expression of thoughts. During the World War the thoughts of men had free expression — hate, battle, murder, sudden death, profiteering — never mind who paid the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And what about religion! The Catholic Church was split into halves, Alliance versus Entente. Protestant churches ditto, and any person who took religion seriously and allowed the will of the mind to control, became the scape-goat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The power of mind over matter is being tested out, not so much regarding the truth of the idea as regarding the applioation of it. An advocate and representative of the theory of evolution says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Man was first in a stage of existence in which his animal nature predominated, and the almost purely , physical ruled him. Then he slowly grew from one state to another until now, when the average man haa attained to a condition in which it might be said that he is coming under the rule of the brain. Hence this age may be regarded and designated as the Brain age. Brain pushes the great enterprises of the day. Brain takes the reins of government; and the elements of the earth, air, and water are being brought under subjection. Man is putting his hand on all physical forces, and slowly but surely attaining such power over the domain of nature as gives evidence that ultimately he may exclaim in the language of Alexander Selkirk, 1 am monarch of all I survey.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This at first glance might look and sound reasonable, but that theory is being tested out, too. The Brain age has brought Europe to the verge of anarchy. Metaphorically speaking, the brainiest nation in the world became a beggar overnight. I refer to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The past eight years have been demonstrating all these theories one way or the other. For thousands of years now men have been speculating and theorizing; and the world never did have a better opportunity than the present to try out its findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Brain did push the enterprise of the World War; but the animal nature and the purely physical — in short, man, the beast — carried the war through regardless of who won it And the last hope of Europe, the League of Nations, will not save Europe for the very simple reason that the League of Nations is a product of the World War, with its intrigues, its alliances, and its scraps of paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The League of Nations would not have come into existence if the World War had not given it birth. To go back farther, the World War would not have reached such stupendous proportions if it had not been for the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. Unity is strength — perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is the purely human element, the tendency to seek companionship. ‘No man liveth to himself is a great truth, apart from its being Scripture. Misery loves company; and the nations of Europe which singly and individually are headed for the abyss, hope that by having a big get-together they can uphold their national existence. Their hope is doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is, the matter with the world! is the question asked by the man in the street. He knows that something is wrong, and very much wrong; but here again is another trouble. Every man who sees that something is wrong is trying to locate the cause, but he is looking at the other fellow, and unconsciously setting a standard for the other fellow to go by. That is true, and the reader knows it. Of the millions of people who are studying conditions, each one of those millions is unconsciously setting his own standard for the rest of the world to measure up to. Thus with a million standards, how could there help but be trouble!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There is just one standard to go by; and that is contained in the little book on the parlor table — the Bible. In the Bible the Christian will find his instructions, -his example, his standards, his ideals, his hopes, his promises, and knowledge of a kind which exceeds anything of which he ever dreamed before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Bible the true student will find the great laws and principles which govern the universe. He will find how man, the mighty atom, himself a part of one of the specks in the universe, came to be here on earth. In short, while others may speculate, and guess, and theorize, the true student neither guesses nor speculates; for he knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This may sound rather large, because the preacher did not tell you these things; but the . fact is that most of the preachers today are followers of Darwin, Spencer, and Huxley; and if you ask their opinion of the Bible, and hold them to that question, it will be a hard matter to get a really straight-forward answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'Putting the Bible in a nutshell, the Pentateuch, or the five books of Moses, contains the law of God; and the rest of the Bible is an elaboration of that law. Almost every man believes in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Briefly again, the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments is the basis of the Old Testament; and the Sermon on the Mount, which clarified and magnified the law, is the basis of the New Testament These truths are very wonderfully and comprehensively explained in Pastor Russell’s Studies in the Scriptures. An earnest, sincere search into these priceless volumes will more than repay the seeker after truth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Mankind’s Great Deliverer By </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gerald Barry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HE condition of the working classes in the world today is very similar to the condition of the children of Israel in Egypt, in the time to Pharaoh, when God sent Moses to deliver them. When we remember that in the Bible, Egypt is used as a symbol of the present world, (Revelation 11:8) full of vain philosophies, but ignorant of the true light, the similarity is made very diear,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As the children of Israel in Egypt groaned under their taskmasters and longed for deliverance but were wholly unable to free themselves, so today and for thousands of years past mankind has been held in bondage by Satan, the god of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> world, the antitypical Pharaoh and his minions of sin and death. Mankind has been wholly unable to free themselves, and their only hope is in God, and in the great antitypical Moses that was promised to be raised up to become their Deliverer. God said to Moses: “I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee.” (Deuteronomy 18:18) This great prophet is the Messiah, Jesus the Head, and the true church members of His body, together constituting Jehovah’s Anointed company, the Christ, the antitypical Moses. The raising up of this great Deliverer has been the work of the entire gospel age. Jesus the Head was tested first and proved a* to His loyalty and obedience to God, even unto death. (Philippians 2:8) Since then the members of His body have one by one been tested, tried and similarly proved (Bomans 8:29) during the past nineteen centuries. And now the Christ, the great Deliverer, is about complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not so generally recognized as it should be that the return of our Lord took place in October 1874, and that His body members who slept were raised by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> throe and one-half years later, in April 1878, the date when, according to the Bible, He assumed groat power, corresponding to the date in the end of the Jewish age when He rode into Jerusalem as King in A. D. 33, just five days before </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">crucifixion, just three and one-half years after the beginning of His earthly ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The members of His body now living are termed in the Bible the &quot;feet” members (1 Corinthians 12:27), or the “feet of him” (Bomans 10:15), the last members to walk this earth, and they have a special work to do — a special message to deliver, as the prophet Isaiah says, &quot;How beautiful upon the mountains [kingdoms of earth] are the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">feet of him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that bring-eth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reign-eth!” (Isaiah 52:7) These are now busily telling the people that Satan’s empire has ended, that Christ has taken His great power to reign (Bevelation 11:17, 18), and that there are millions of people now living who will never die. — Matthew 24:22; Zechariah 13:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Moses presented </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">elf to the children of Israel to be their deliverer, he was welcomed by them; as we read: &quot;When they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped.” (Exodus 4:31) But when Moses went in to Pharaoh, he was told, &quot;Wherefore do ye, Moses . and Aaron, let the people from their works! get you pnto your burdens.”(Exodus 5:4) And so, recently, Satan, the antitypical Pharaoh, operating through big business and its allies — the politicians and the clergy — has, like Pharaoh of old, increased the burden of the laboring classes in various ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Moses went to God about the matter, and God reminded him that He had made a covenant with Abraham to give his seed the. land of promise, and that He would certainly fulfil His covenant (Exodus 6:2-8) And so today, we can take great comfort out of the covenant God made with Abraham, knowing that He win surely bring the blessing that He has premised to all the families of the earth, through Abraham’s seed, the Christ, Head and body. (Galatians 3:8, 16, 29) As great judgments were needed before Pharaoh would consent to let Israel go, so, great and terrible judgments are now about to be poured out upon antitypical Egypt, which will convince the world of the Savior’s presence and of the greatness of His power (Isaiah 19:20-22) and humble mankind, and .finally cause Satan, the god of this world, to let go his hold on the masses of mankind when the last plague occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of Christ’s Millennial reign it is written prophetically that “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor . . . and his enemies shall lick the dust . . . Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; all nations shall serve him. For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence; and precious shall their blood be in his sight.”(Psalm 72:4, 9,11-14) And again: &quot;I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.” (Isaiah 13:12) “So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun.”—Isaiah 59:19.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Sugar Plum or Sinai Methods:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A FTEB reading the trenchant criticism of Mr. ftoseikrans by another writer in the Golden -Age of August 30th, I feel that such criticisms reflect upon your editorial discrimination, in the eyes of many who share the latter’s views that such articles should not escape the waste basket of the G. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Which? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By John Bidding (Jamaica)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is, therefore, with a sincere desire to hold up your hands that I hasten to inform you that I am of those who thoroughly endorse such imaginative forecasts of the possibilities of the an</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">g “trouble such as never was,” etc., as expressed by Mr. Bosenkrans; and that I recognise in the G. A. the work of the antitypical</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John the Baptist before Herod and his paramour, church and state, who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> soon adopt drastic measures of repression of such remon-•tance as the hard facts and witty caricatures of the G. A. are unmistakably administering to the apostate &quot;woman”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Nothing could be more evident than that many sincere brethren are expecting the Lord to adopt the sugar-plum method of bringing the world to its knees instead of a shaking such as will make the terrors of Sinai appear like a flea beside an elephant I—Hebrews 12: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We can never forget the cost of the &quot;Finished Mystery”; but the G. A. may cost much more. Hence we cannot afford to trifle. (Even when the article “God Is Arrested” would almost make you hear us smiling!) “Only be thou [still] of good courage,” dear brother; and, in the interest of truth and liberty, “let pens flow with all freedom, restrained only by the good old rule: 'Conciseness without obscurity, and fullness without redundancy.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">May the good hand of the Lord still rest upon you and others of the G. A. staff!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Watching for the Day By </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Clifton Orrin Foster</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OR eighteen hundred years God’s faithful people have been watching for the dawning of the glorious Millennial Day. They have realized that, as the Bible teaches, the world is in darkness under the rule of the Prince of Darkness, who now exercises authority through his control of “the children of disobedience”; and these by reason of ignorance, weakness, etc., are more numerous than the children of obedience.—Ephesians 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From an earthly viewpoint it has been a long while since sin entered the world — over six thousand years. And it has been a long time also since Jesus died for the sins of the world — over eighteen hundred years. But the time has not been long from the divine standpoint, the Lord declaring that a thousand years are but as one day with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">During six of these thousand-year days in which God rests or desists from interfering with the world’s affairs, He has permitted a reign of evil; but His arrangements are complete whereby Messiah, the Redeemer, will fully restore all the willing and obedient to all that Adam forfeited.—Acts 3:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Under Messiah’s glorious reign, the last thousand year’s restitution work will bring earth to the condition originally designed by God! It will complete the creation of earth, and mankind as a race of God-like rulers of earth’s affairs.\ Man, having tasted both good and evil and having chosen good, will be granted life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Redeemer mentioned both the present time and the time of trouble which we see looming upon every hand and threatening the very foundations of society — political, social, and religious. He bade His followers rejoice even amidst the trouble, because it marks the day of deliverance from the power of sin and death. He said: “When these tilings begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your deliverance draweth nigh.”—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If violation of law is anarchy, then we already have anarchy amongst the nations. They are all under the dominion of &quot;the prince of this world”—Satan. The Bible declares what is soon to come—“every man’s hand a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">gains</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">t his neighbor.” How thankful we are that while this awful trouble must come because of man’s sin and selfishness, yet the Word of God points out that upon the ruins of the present order shall come the glorious kingdom of Messiah — the long-looked-for Golden Age! Daniel stated that at this time the wise of God’s people should understand the things kept secret from past ages and generations. “The mystery of God shall be finished” is another of the promises of the Bible respecting the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not all are yet awake; but the joy of those who are tends more and more to awaken all the virgin class. To such will be revealed the great “mystery” of this gospel age. The mystery is that Jesus is the Head, Chief, Lord, over the church, which is His body; and that the body members will be glorified with the Head on the spirit plane; and that then Head and body will constitute the great Messiah, whose spiritual reign of a thousand years will result in the blessing and uplifting of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“There the dead shall arise from the tomb, And the living to health be restored;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">And away from all sorrow and gloom, They’ll be led by the life-giving Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In that day earth shall yield its increase, and the obedient shall eat the fat of the land; they shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; sins will be blotted out, and all evil suppressed. This is the hope held out! These are the promises made by Jehovah God who swore by Himself — for there is none greater — that they would be fulfilled! And now we are living in the days of the Son of man, and He is taking unto Himself the kingdoms of this earth and reigns. Our prayer, &quot;Thy kingdom come,” has been answered! Even now, millions now are living who will never die! To these the Lord seems to say: “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock” &quot;And my reward is with me, to give every man according as his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">work</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The great eloek of the ages strikes the hour of golden sunrise, and dawn appears. The great reforms already accomplished, and the great blessings in scientific discovery are but the foregleams of the new day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The searching and healing rays of the rising Bun of Righteousness win shine clearly into and upon all, and chase sin's dark night for ever away.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Blessings Extraordinary</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE before as a page of a magazine which explains just how to go about it to obtain extraordinary blessings. It is gotten out by a Boman Catholic concern near Buffalo, which acknowledges that it is in line for all the blessings that are to be had for the faithful Thus, for example, it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Our holy Father, Pope Leo Xlll, at the request &lt;d our dear BL Bev. Bishop, graciously grants to all the members of the Association of our Blessed Lady of Victory his apostolic benediction. He confers the same Upon the present Bev. Directors of the Buffalo Catholic Protectory, with all the religious in charge of the sama, and all its inmates, also with a plenary indulgence at the hour of death.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It must be a grand thing to have some regular scheme like the multiplication table for forcing blessings out of the Almighty. Particularly would such a method of securing blessings be of interest to those who are familiar with the Scriptures and who know very well that the .^Scriptures recognize no such plan of hocus-pocus. However, for the benefit of any who may wish to know just how they go about it, we give below the litany, the repetition of which nine times is supposed to obtain some special gracb, favor, or blessing from God: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord, have mercy on us.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fTT] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With issue Number 00 we began running Judge Hutherford’s new book, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|TT1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Harp of God&quot;, with aecoapaniJag questions, taking the place of both &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{j^&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. Advanced and Juvenile kinle Btndfea whltb have been hitherto pwbhshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">”*When this heavenly messenger had finished his -wonderful speech to the astonished shepherds, then it was, as if waiting a given signal, the multitudinous heavenly host stood forth and sang the good tidings of great joy which ultimately shall be to all people. Their song was but the reflex of what had been announced. These sweet singers told in words of praise of God’s beneficent purpose ultimately to bless all the families of the earth. It was a song of glory from heaven, and the hills of Judea echoed the message of peace and good will toward men. And throughout the gospel age this sweet anthem has filled with joy the heart of many a sad wanderer; and seemingly again and again these have heard the song from heaven: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The world is now entering its darkest period, and when mankind reaches the point of extremity, then will be God’s opportunity to reveal to all sad hearts that the birth of Jesus was the greatest event in history to that time; and that shortly this same great Jesus, now in glory, will extend the blessings of life, liberty, and happiness to the whole groaning creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“’The place of Jesus’ birth was truly according to and in fulfillment of prophecy, thus showing that God had foreordained and prepared the conditions for His birth. (Micah 5:2; Matthew 2:4-6) Jesus was not born on December </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">25,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> as in generally supposed; but His birth occurred about the first of October. Midwinter would have been a very inopportune time for the shepherds to be watching their sheep in the fields and sleeping in the open. In addition to this circumstantial evidence, all the facts show that the birth of Jesus was in October, and that December 25, nine months previous, was probably the date of the annunciation. “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. ” (Luke 1: 30, 31) For a fill discussion of this subject see “Studies in th* Scriptures,” Volume 2, page 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">““Much has been said and written concerning the three wise men who journeyed from the East to pay their homage to the babe Jesus, born in Bethlehem. Particularly at Christmas time is our attention called to this by pictures on cards, etc., of the wise men journeying to the West, supposedly being guided by the star sent by Jehovah. It has been presumed that Jehovah by the star led these wise men to the place of Jesus’ birth. The BiUe proof shows however, that these three wise men were not sent by the Lord God, but that they were directed by the great adversary, the devil, in his attempt to destroy the babe. Whether they knew it or not, these three wise men were parties to a great conspiracy, originated and carried out by the master mind, Satan, the devil, in his attempt to destroy the seed of promise, the great Savior of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“’When Jehovah drove Adam and Eve from Eden He likewise pronounced a condemnation upon Satan. He said concerning Satan and the woman: “I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15) From that time forward, Satan, the great adversary, has attempted to destroy every one whom God has favored and who he thought might constitute the seed of promise.</span></p>

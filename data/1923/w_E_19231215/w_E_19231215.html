<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now being presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s &quot;Word.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word, of Cod, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge oug readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28 :14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when thfl last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15 : 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be * partaker of the divine nature,’ and share his glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3 :2 ; John 17 : 24 ; Romans 8 :17 ; 2 Peter 1: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12: Matthew 24J 14 ; Revelation 1: 6; 20: 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution, of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed,—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ANNUAL REPORT NINETEEN TWENTY-THREE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;0 give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. . . . Remember </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">marvelous works that he hath done.”—Psalm 105:1,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ANOTHER year in the Lord’s service has passed. Z-X it has been a blessed year. It is our privilege to *■ call upon his name and to give thanks unto him with joy for all he has done for us. His work is marvelous, and none other could have done it except the Lord. To recount to each other what he has done and to make known his deeds among the people is a happy privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in which the Society is engaged is unlike any other work that is being done on earth; for it is the Lord’s work. Our chief purpose is to glorify God and to advertise the King and his kingdom. Great political organizations, at a sacrifice of much time, money and effort, attempt to form a new government with a hope of bettering the conditions of society. Such efforts have usually failed. But the Lord’s people are engaged in a campaign looking to the establishment of a new government which cannot possibly fail. That new government will be upon the shoulder of the Lord Jesus Christ. It will be a government of righteousness and lasting peace. Then the people will call his name Wonderful, The mighty God, The everlasting Father; and of his government and peace and righteousness there shall be no end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s people are not following an illusion, but know that the results are certain, that the kingdom of Messiah is at hand; and they have the privilege, by his grace, of making this known to others. God’s prophet had a vision of this dawning of the new day, and moved to do so by the spirit of the Lord wrote: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bring-eth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth I”—Isaiah 52: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All nations are in distress and perplexity. Men’s hearts are failing them for fear of what they see occurring and what is about to follow. Divers and numerous suggestions are offered as solutions of the world’s difficulties ; but none of these meet the requirements. There </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">nothing in human statesmanship, financial power, or nominal Christianity to comfort the people by giving them any assurance of good for the future. Therefore it is God’s opportunity to send his messengers to declare unto the world the cause of the present distress and trouble and to show the divine remedy that will bring the desire of all nations. Hence the work that is being done by the Lord and his servants in his name is marvelous in our eyes. All glory is to the Lord, and in due time the victory will be his absolutely, and all the people will recognize it, and everything that lives and breathes will praise him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the name of the corporation that is transacting the business c material affairs in carrying on the work of a body of consecrated Christian people who are engaged in advertising the King and his kingdom. There are certain conditions that one must comply with, in addition to being a consecrated Christian, in order to be a member of the corporate body of the Society. There are many consecrated and devoted Christians who are engaged in the work who are not members of the corporation. Hence the Society, whether it be called the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society or the International Bible Students Association, in the broad sense means the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">body of consecrated people harmoniously working together in the service of the Lord in proclaiming the message of his kingdom and striving to build up each other in the most holy faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly consecrated people on earth have been witnesses for the Lord during the Gospel age, and have been used by him as his channel and method of conveying his message to others. That is the sense in which the Society is spoken of as the channel of the Lord to carry on his work. No offense, of course, is meant. Surely no one truly consecrated to the Lord could object to the statement that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord’s people are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">channel to do his work,</span><span class="font6"> regardless of the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font6">body of Christians. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">Scriptures require that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font6">who are approved by the Lord must be true and faithful witnesses to him. There is, as indeed there could be, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font6">division in the body of Christ; and all who are in harmony with the Lord of necessity must be in harmony</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">with each other; and where a body of Christians in harmony with the Lord and in harmony with each other is doing his work, there could be no objection to the statement that these are the agency or channel of the Lord for bearing his message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The corporate body acts as the agent for the entire number of Christians thus engaged in the Lord’s work. The Lord does everything orderly; hence his work necessarily must be done orderly. The corporate body for convenience is designated (and properly so) as the official part of the Society. It is the official or corporate part that holds the annual meeting to which the report is made. Not every person who attends the annual meeting is entitled to cast a vote in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">corporation;</span><span class="font6"> but every consecrated child of God in harmony with the Lord and his cause is entitled to cast a vote in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">church,</span><span class="font6"> and is therefore equally a member of the Society as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The official body of the Society is made up of those consecrated Christians who have made contributions to the funds of the Society to the amount of ten dollars and more to carry on the work and who are in full harmony with that work and with each other. These are entitled to vote at meetings of the corporation. The elected officials or servants of the corporation are the Board of Directors, composed of seven brethren and the officers, namely, the President, Vice-President, and Secretary and Treasurer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While neither the law nor the charter requires an annual report to be presented or published, it has always been the custom of the Society to do this; and therefore it becomes the privilege as well as the pleasure of the President of the Society to make this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Executive Department of the Society is situated at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. The President is the general manager of all the work, both domestic and foreign. It is his duty to keep in close touch with the Society’s work all over the earth and, by the Lord’s grace and acting on authority conferred by the charter, to manage and direct the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Secretary and Treasurer is the custodian of the books and files of the Society and of the funds of the Society; and it is his duty to receive and pay out all moneys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To publish a full and detailed report of the activities of the Society would be impossible unless a large volume were devoted thereto. We give herewith a general outline:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">operative offices</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The operative offices of the Society are situated at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, New York, and are directed by an office manager, who in turn is under the general supervision of the President of the Society. The entire operative force is duly organized upon the theory of efficiency, and the desire and attempt is to do the work as efficiently as it is humanly possible for those engaged in it to do it. There are various departments with different clerks in charge of each department. These departments are: Correspondence, Service, Accounting and Cost Accounting, Dispatch and Control, Purchasing, Stencil, Editorial, and General. At the Concord Street office, in addition to the English work there is work carried on in the following languages, to wit: Arabic, Armenian, Czechoslovakian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Roumanian, Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the general office work there is that done in the factory and printing department which is also managed by the office manager under the supervision of the President of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mail or correspondence with the home office at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, is conducted by this department, consisting in the acknowledgment of letters, donations, orders, etc., and in the writing of such other letters in connection with the work as are necessary. During the past year 185,443 letters have been received and 169,019 have been dispatched from this office. Three brethren handle this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of this department is the organization of colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs, sharp-shooters, and class workers, and assigning territory for this work, keeping accounts, receiving and tabulating reports, directing the shipment of literature, filling orders, dispatching ‘'Bulletins,” and generally to look after the service work in the field. Three brethren are employed in this department. All the colporteur work is directed from this department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCOUNTING AND COST ACCOUNTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This department keeps accounts with all the branch offices and commercial business houses, attends to matters relating to lost shipments, keeping of stock and the cost of operating the office and the factory. By this arrangement the cost of publishing anything can be ascertained before the work is started, and at any time in its progress the amount of cost incurred may be quickly known. Two brethren handle this department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DISPATCH AND CONTROL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This department, directed from the office, manages and directs the manufacturing of books and booklets and the printing of magazines, tracts, or any other printed matter. The entire office and factory is worked on schedule time; and it is the business of this department to see that the orders and things being manufactured are kept up to schedule and that the interruption </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">work in one department does not interfere with work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">another. One brother has charge of this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PURCHASING DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This department attends to the purchasing of paper, ink, cloth, cover stock, machine supplies, office supplies, and, in fact, everything used in connection with the operative offices, and is handled by one brother, known as the purchasing agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">STENCIL DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name and address of each Watch Tower and Golden Age subscriber is kept on a stencil. This department has charge of these stencils, the changing of addresses, writing new addresses, reporting non-delivery, and maintaining the list in proper order for mailing, and enters all new and renewal subscriptions to both The Watch Tower and The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This department is separate and distinct from the Editorial Committee. Manuscript is furnished by the Editorial Committee and the Editor of The Golden Age. This department then arranges the copy for composition, attends to proof-reading, and correcting of typographical and other errors. It also examines current magazines and newspapers for the purpose of keeping uj&gt; w ith the development of the world’s affairs and the evidences of the setting up of the kingdom. Five are employed in this department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This includes the general work of the office and factory not embraced in any particular department. It also includes activities looking to the encouragement of classes to develop speakers and to start Berean studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has heretofore been announced in The Watch Tower that the Society maintains a printing and book binding factory at 18 Concord Street, fully equipped with typesetting machines which set type in twenty-two different languages, printing presses, folders, sewing machines, mashers, stereotype and electrotype molding equipment, and binding machinery, for the purpose of printing magazines and books and binding the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This factory was fully installed and started, and is now finally paid for, and is now the property of the Society; and the Society can manufacture its own books much cheaper than it could otherwise get them, thereby enabling the books to be placed in the hands of the people to the best advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Few realize the work in connection with making </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">book; and for the benefit of those who are interested we name the processes required to make a book from its inception to delivery. See January 1st Watch Tower for this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year 1923 there were manufactured in the Society’s plant at the above address cloth-bound and paper-bound books and booklets to the total number of 1,705,512. This was not sufficient to supply the demand during the year, and it became necessary to have manufactured under contract by other concerns books to the number of 731,375. In addition thereto, our own factory published 1,820,500 copies of The Golden Age; 1,326,975 copies of The Watch Tower; 300,000 “Harp” quiz cards; 13,076,500 tracts for free distribution; 710,455 handbills; 235,500 hymn slips; making a grand total of 19,932,957 pieces of literature printed. The above includes printing in English and other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CIRCULATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the number of colporteurs has been increased from 489 to 921, and at present there are 889 colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs in the active service. In addition to the colporteurs there are reported to the service department class workers and sharpshooters to the total number of 9,847. During the year there has been an average of 1,789 workers in the field each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year books have been sold as follows: Studies in the Scriptures and Scenarios, 711,865; “The Harp of God,” 529,642; booklets, 985,330; Bibles, 7,588; making a grand total of 2,247,595.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The resolution passed by the Cedar Point Convention in 1922 was distributed from the home office to the number of 13,076,500; and the total distribution in the various languages in different countries of the earth was upwards of 45,000,000. The resolution passed by the Los Angeles Convention in August of this year is now in course of manufacture, and it is expected that its circulation will reach even </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">greater number than that of the former resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year sixteen conventions have been held, chief amongst which were the conventions at Tacoma, Washington; Los Angeles, California; and New York city, an account of which has heretofore been given in The Watch Tower. These conventions have been </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">great uplift to the brethren, stimulated them to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">activ</span><span class="font6">ity, increased their faith, strengthened their hearts and united them more closely together in the bonds </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of love </span><span class="font6">and sweet fellowship, and enabled them to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">press on with </span><span class="font6">increased zeal in the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD-WIDE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year at regular intervals the world-wide witness has been carried on. That is to say, on a fixed day in every country where the truth is known, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in every language where the truth </span><span class="font6">is spoken, meetings have been held at which the brethren used the same subject in presenting the divine plan to the public. This subject has always been “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” or, when something else was used, that has been a subhead. The value of keeping before the minds </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the people one message is that it clearly identifies the Society with the Lord’s work. It is our privilege and duty to be faithful witnesses to the Lord, testifying to the people that God has a people on earth who are not ashamed to declare the gospel of Jesus Christ, and who are anxious to testify that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. From all parts of the world reports come that the attendance at these public meetings has steadily increased. The inter</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">est </span><span class="font6">of the public is likewise increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These meetings have been a great stimulus to the brethren; for they afford wide opportunity for service in various languages. Constantly holding before the people the message of the kingdom is bound to have its effect as does the constant dropping of water upon a stone. The brethren appreciate the fact that they are working shoulder to shoulder for a common cause, and the Lord has certainly added his blessing everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the Pilgrim service in the United States has given a good account of itself. In the United States alone there have been engaged in the Pilgrim service English and foreign speaking brethren to the number of 137. These have traveled in the aggregate 720,328 miles. They have addressed parlor or class meetings as well as public meetings. The attendance at class meetings during the year has been 300,107. A total of 8,213 public meetings were held, with a total attendance of 985,913. In addition to this, great numbers heard the truth by means of radio broadcasting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The shepherds and the principal of the flock in nominal Christendom are often much concerned about the finances of our work. They circulate the report that the work is supported by Jews, and again by the Soviet government or some other similar organization. Of course there is absolutely no foundation for these conclusions, but they originate in the fertile imagination of those who are opposed to the truth. We have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font6">hesitancy in making known whence our funds have come. Not one penny has at any time been received from Jews, representatives of the Soviet, or any other person or organization outside of those who are interested in proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ, which was preached by him and his inspired apostles of old. When a man or a woman is thoroughly devoted to the Lord and appreciates the fact that there is only one means of solving the perplexing problems of mankind, and that is Messiah’s kingdom, love and zeal for the Lord prompt such a one to help his fellow man to understand the Lord’s arrangement so that he may have hope. The divine commission given to the church (Isaiah 61:1,2) is to bind up the broken-hearted, to comfort those that mourn, by proclaiming the glad tidings of great joy concerning God’s plan of redemption and deliverance. The true Christian appreciates the fact that we are living in a time in which the old order is passing away and the new kingdom is coming in. His love for God and for his fellow man impels him to use his faculties, time, energies and money </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">thus aid and comfort his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nominal Christian organizations spend a great </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">deal </span><span class="font6">of money on high-salaried men, boards, committees, etc. In our Society no one desires or attempts to make private gain. On the contrary, he desires to use what substance he has and to work with his hands as opportunity affords to gain a livelihood and to spend all spare time in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. Hence the cost of carrying on this work is reduced to a minimum; and the money provided for it comes from voluntary donations, which we call the “Good Hopes” fund, and which is donated in small amounts by the various consecrated brethren throughout the world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">append hereto a summary of the financial statement filed by the Treasurer of the Society, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Receipts :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To balance from 1922....................................$ 19,253.43</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Balance, October 1, 1923......... &nbsp;— &nbsp;&nbsp;1.624.47</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">$214,656.42</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If we had more money we could do more; but the work is laid out and attempted to be carried on in proportion as the Lord provides the funds. We realize that it is his work and not man’s, and we delight to accomplish the most that we can with the provision made. Where sendee is prompted by love much more can be accomplished than when prompted by any other motive. Ere long the world will come to a realization that love is the only power that will move things in the right direction, and then profiteers and profiteering will cease. When the people learn righteousness, then every one will be striving to do good to every other one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FOREIGN FIELD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old world is bleeding to death. Many are starving for want of hearing the Word of God. They are looking for something to comfort mind and heart. While the philanthropic people of the world are trying to relieve the material sufferings of the people, it is the privilege and duty of Christians to “bind up the broken-hearted and comfort those that mourn” who desire to be comforted. This can be done only through the Word of God, pointing them to his great plan of redemption and deliverance. With the thought of fulfilling this commission, the Society during the year has endeavored to do what it could to comfort the soul-sick ones of foreign countries who are looking for a happier and better day. We only wish that we might have done much more, and we pray that the Lord may provide the way to do much more during the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the end that the work might be more systematically and efficiently handled in that part of Europe which is suffering most a central European office of the Society is maintained at Zurich, Switzerland, in charge of Brother C. C. Binkele as manager. Switzerland is about the only country of Europe that has maintained anywhere near her state of equilibrium since 1914. It has therefore been the most favorable place from which to operate a central European office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of the foreign work through each of the offices is done from Brooklyn under the supervision of the President of the Society; but it has been found more advantageous to direct the work of Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Belgium, and Holland, as well as Switzerland, from the Central European Office. Concerning the conditions in these countries we quote from a report received from the Central European Office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Conditions in Germany are growing from bad to worse so rapidly that one cannot tell what moment there will be an outbreak that will be fearful indeed, embroiling all Europe and bringing quickly the great Armageddon conflict. We therefore ask you to please continue your efforts to assist us in every possible way in the spreading of the Lord’s message on this continent, as far and wide and fast as possible. The greatest help in view, of course, is our own printing plant. But you will understand, dear </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother, </span><span class="font5">better than any one else could, that the impoverished nations of Europe are a poor soil to work upon with what we have to work. And if it is the Lord’s will that they shall hear the message of the kingdom and our privilege to bear it to them, we must sacrifice financially almost more than any other way; and as there is only little Switzerland that is able to take care of herself, it is always her big brother American that must be called upon for help again and again. . . . The best plan and the only hope of ever getting cheaper literature and plenty of it for Europe is to Increase our printing plant at Bern. Books cost </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">too </span><span class="font5">much for the price at which we shall be compelled to sell them; but if we can produce the books cheaply we shall be able to do more for the poor districts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The money situation in Europe being so deplorable, and the trouble increasing the people’s desire for the truth, seemed to make it imperative that the Society use more money in that land in spreading the glad tidings. Aside from Great Britain, Switzerland, and Sweden, practically all the European countries as well as other parts of the foreign field have required financial help during the year to carry on the work. It will be observed by reference to the financial summary that the major portion of the money contributed by the friends to the Society through the “Good Hopes” fund has been spent to spread the message of the kingdom amongst foreign peoples. It is a great privilege and blessing, of course, that the American brethren have been permitted by the Lord to feed the soul-hungry ones of Europe upon his precious Word. If the Lord sees fit to supply us with much larger sums of money during the ensuing year, then we shall take delight in using more to carry the message of salvation to those countries that have so little ability to help themselves. Practically all the free literature distributed in continental Europe during the past year has been paid for by the Brooklyn office; and great quantities of books have been produced and sold at less than cost. But the Lord has blessed the efforts, whereof we are glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of the World War the Society’s work in Switzerland had been so disturbed by false brethren that there were only a few consecrated left in that land who were doing anything to put forth the message of the kingdom. During the past two years the Lord has brought many to a knowledge of the truth; and now there are in Switzerland more than three thousand fully consecrated ones, who are doing their best to spread the glad tidings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably the truth has reached more of the Germanspeaking people during the past two years than those of any other country in the world. As an illustration, prior to the World War there was a city in which there was a class of less than one hundred consecrated, and now that class is composed of more than two thousand. Likewise </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has the class attendance throughout Germany </span><span class="font6">increased. The order-loving people of Germany, hard pressed by the trouble, are turning to the Lord for consolation, just as the Scriptures foretold. The Lord has been adding his blessing to the efforts of the brethren to spread the gospel there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For about fifteen years the Society’s office in Germany was maintained at Barmen, which city is within the limits of the Ruhr district occupied by the French. When the French army took possession of the Ruhr they did not occupy Barmen at first; while almost every other city in the district was occupied by them. Our brethren were advised to find a place and move the office as quickly as possible, we believing that the army operations would greatly hamper our work. Diligent effort was put forth to find a place and move the office. A very suitable place was found at Magdeburg on the Elbe River, which affords water shipment all the way to New York. One morning the information reached the Brooklyn headquarters that the German office had been safely removed to Magdeburg. The very next morning the public press announced that the French had taken possession of Barmen. We thanked the dear Lord for his protection and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Germany is spreading and is in splendid condition, in view of the great trouble there. Most of the money u^ed in Germany during the past year has been furnished by the Society from Brooklyn. We quote from the report of the German manager, Brother Balzereit, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Because of the Increase of distress and perplexity in cur country the people begin to ask more and more for God, visiting in goodly numbers meetings held by the German branch and the classes. But by reason of the steadily decreasing value of money, and because of unemployment, many people are not able to buy any literature, although our literature is very cheap. They are not in position to buy even the most important necessities of life. Therefore we exert ourselves to be independent of worldly printing institutions, which demand enormous gold-mark prices. The Watch Tower, The Golden Age, and all office forms such as Invoices, catalogs, letterheads, post cards, letters of instruction, bulletins, handbills, and tracts are being printed in the German Bible House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By means of the help and assistance given us from time to time by the President of the Society, we have been enabled to equip the Bible House with the following machinery :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2 large steam presses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2 folding machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 Tiegel press</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 Tiegel automatic printing press</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 large press for binding plant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All this and much other small equipment has greatly helped the German work; but our greatest care until this hour has been to be independent to the extent that we should be able to publish the Studies, ‘The Harp,’ etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Enabled by the president of the Society, our beloved Brother Rutherford, we have acquired a property at Magdeburg (Elbe), having an area of 1,334.229 square yards; working and lodging rooms with an area of 12,257.677 square yards; and cellar and stock rooms having an area of 402.457 square yards. The enlarged Bible House makes it possible to place additional machinery. We have now bought one of the latest ‘Heidelberger’ presses, double sheet form, equipped for sewing and wire-stitching. With this press it would be possible to print the Studies ; but in order to be entirely independent in the manufacture of books, some other machinery is required, such as an automatic folding machine, bookbinding machine, casemakin r machine, and other smaller things, which cannot be boughi by the German work for the reason above mentioned. But we are thankful to the Lord that we can hope to begin to print Volume I within three or four weeks, and to print ‘The Harp’ thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The message of the kingdom spreads more and more in Germany, and the hearts of those who hear the message are full of desire for the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We wish to take this opportunity in behalf of the German brethren to render thanks to the dear American brethren, and particularly to the President of the Society ami to the Society, for the help given us at all times to perform the task of satisfying the hunger for spiritual food which is so great in our country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The European countries have not observed our change in fiscal year until the present year. Therefore the report this year means practically ten months’ activities instead of twelve; but notwithstanding this it will be seen that the results have been greater during 1923 than in any other year. Quoting further from the German report concerning the sale of literature in German:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Studies in the Scriptures, ‘The Harp,’ and other of the Society’s books sold during the fiscal year, 932,907; public meetings held, 4,608; total attendance, 1,243,72!); class meetings held for the newly interested, 7,697, with an attendance of 451,814; meetings of the brethren, 30,379, with an attendance of 1,195,599; total attendance at meetings, 2,891,142; colporteurs in the field (regular and auxiliary), 3,642; Pilgrims giving all their time, 10; copies of free literature distributed, 8,753,020.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RUSSIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been almost impossible to do anything in Russia, evidently due to the fact that that people were so long kept in darkness by the Czar. A letter recently received from Russia says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This letter is written for the purpose of informing you of what is happening in Russia. Brother Rutherford was right when he said that tribulation will begin from the North. This saying Is being fulfilled now. The Jews are being chased out of Russia to Palestine. Verily 1925 will show in fact the fulfilment of prophecy, in which year blessings will begin from Abraham. At present we have the necessary things, food, clothing, etc., for the human life; but we are in great need of spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The books that were sent to us were confiscated by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">government. So we beg you to send us extracts in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">letter </span><span class="font5">form of all literature which you have in the Russian language ; for we have no food for our spiritual growth, and as you know, we should not stay in one place, but go forward and show that we are worthy of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At present many are hungering for the Word of Truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not </span><span class="font5">long ago five persons showed their consecration by water Immersion, and fifteen Baptists have joined us also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society is making an attempt to get the literature into Russia and will continue to do so, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW BRANCH OFFICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year the Society has opened new branch offices in Czechoslovakia, British West Africa, and South America. Our readers will recall that it was in Bohemia, now a part of Czechoslovakia, that the great reformer John Huss earnestly contended for the faith once delivered to the saints and for this cause suffered martyrdom, being burned at the stake. Surely the Lord has some people in that land where the good seed so long ago was sown. The Lord opened the way, and the Society is happy to have an opportunity of -cniling the truth there. A branch office has been established in Most; and during the past few months eighteen public meetings have been held with a total attendance of 5,175. There are quite a number there \\ ho are consecrated; and the class meetings held during the last six months have numbered 360, with a total attendance of 9,000. These class meetings, of course, a re attended by newly interested ones. While the people are quite poor, books have been sold to the number of (1,191, and free literature distributed to the number of 191,500 pieces. The conditions are not so favorable for spreading the truth because of governmental interference, but the brethren are zealous and are pressing on. From the manager’s report we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have no regular colporteurs In the field. Six brethren made application for permits several months ago, but have not received them. Most of the books are sold by class workers. We could do much more if the brethren were not so scattered. Many of them have not the financial means to travel from place to place to distribute literature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH WEST AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Spring of 1923 information reached the Brooklyn headquarters that there was a brother on the west coast of Africa, in Sierra Leone, deeply interested in the truth; and the population being quite intelligent, it was thought a good field. No witness had been given there. It seemed to be the Lord’s will that some one should be sent. Brother W. R. Brown, of Trinidad, B. W. I., was selected; and, accompanied by Sister Brown, he journeyed to Sierra Leone and established headquarters at Free Town. Arriving the latter part of April, they began on April 28 to hold meetings and sell books. From the very first the halls were packed out; and by the first week of May all the books that Brother Brown had taken with him were disposed of and he cabled for more. A shipment of 5,000 was immediately dispatched, and this was followed by other shipments. The work continues to increase, and the interest increases. The clergy have taken up the cudgel and are attacking the truth through the press. Brother Brown answered them time and again, the papers publishing both sides. A letter written from there October 1 says: “The ministers arc now silent in the papers. Because of these answers to our critics in the papers we are receiving letters from many places for the books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work has increased so rapidly there that Brother Brown called for an assistant; and Brother C. Brown, of Winnipeg, formerly of the West Indies, is now on his way to join in the work at Sierra Leone, and the purpose is after the work is well under way there to establish an office in Liberia and spread the truth amongst the people there. It was our Master who said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brazil, South America, has long been in darkness. Darkness covers the land, and gross darkness the people. It is reported that about eighty percent of the population is illiterate. The prevailing language is Portuguese, while the major portion of the population are Catholics or spiritists. Early in the year 1923 the Society sent Brother George Young to Rio de Janeiro, to look over the ground and see what might be done to spread the gospel there. For about twenty years there had lived in that vicinity one lone sister, consecrated to the Lord, patiently waiting upon him and serving him. Brother Young arrived and called at her residence, sending word that an American Pilgrim brother was there to see her. The sister came to the parlor, and for a time was speechless. Taking hold of the hand of Brother Young, and looking earnestly into his face, finally she remarked: “Are you a really live Pilgrim?” She was overjoyed at seeing one who was trusting in the Lord and attempting to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Young began to hold meetings in Rio de Janeiro and neighboring towns. The interest was good from the very beginning, and is constantly on the increase, and now there is quite a number fully consecrated. For want of an interpreter the work was greatly hampered there for a time. Brother Young reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Interest in the work here has Increased so rapidly that I was feeling my inability to do it. Additionally, no one seemed competent to help in the work or to translate. Today my heart is full of praise to our heavenly Father, and he has raised up one right here in our midst. A talented gentleman and his wife became interested in the first lectures. He is private secretary to the President of a large corporation, speaks English, Portuguese, and German, fluently. His wife is brilliant, speaks Portuguese and French. They are thoroughly consecrated. A few days ago this brother wrote me: ‘I have already handed in my resignation. I am so happy that I can hardly wait until the end of the month; and I will be right over in Rio to do the greatest work in my life for our dear Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">My wife </span><span class="font5">shares my sentiments.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Young further says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The free literature is creating much interest. Babylon is solid against us. Catholic and Protestant; but the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wheat </span><span class="font5">will hear the message.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When we </span><span class="font6">consider that the work there began June 1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">that no literature was on hand at the time, it is remarkable how the Lord has blessed the work. Since then the “Millions” book and “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” have been translated and published in Portuguese. “The Harp of God” also is nearly complete in the Portuguese language, besides a large quantity of free literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From June 1 to September 30 Brother Young has held 21 public meetings, with a total attendance of 3,600; 48 class meetings, with an attendance of 1,100; distributed free literature in Portuguese to the number of 5,000 copies; books sold, 2,138; and now there is one colporteur in the field. On October 1, publication of The Watch Tower in Portuguese began in Rio de Janeiro. The “Hell” booklet was also ready at that time in Portuguese. Brother Young reporting says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The outlook for the work here is becoming brighter. Our loving Father seems to be arranging everything In a wonderful way. Quite a number of the people are consecrating. When ‘The Harp of God' is published, these people will have Instruction which will help them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As soon as the work is on a more solid basis in Brazil, Brother Young expects to move on into Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s work in South Africa is managed from Cape Town. The prevailing language there is Dutch, while a large portion of the population speak English. The distribution of the Cedar Point resolution has had a great effect in South Africa. It is the custom of the Dutch clergymen to visit their parishioners once a week to gather in the shekels by way of a house-to-house collection. Since the distribution of this resolution these shepherds of the flock have been much disturbed. Their parishioners meet them at the door and many of them with a copy of the resolution in hand shake it in their face and say: “You ought to read this and you would not come around again to get money from us,” and refuse to give them money. And thus the -waters are being turned away from Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The manager for the Society there reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In addition to the distribution of the proclamations In English and Dutch by colporteurs In the field, Brother Scott has recently completed a six months’ tour covering Cape Province, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, which was undertaken for the sole purpose of distributing proclamations In the Dutch and English, the total number given out amounting to approximately 300,000. In addition they have been posted to the clergymen of every denomination throughout the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia. There is not the slightest doubt that the public </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">becoming alive to the fact that the clergymen are taking their money and giving them very little In exchange; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">wherever opposition is aroused in the ranks of the clergy the people compare the attitude of their ministers unfavorably with that of the Bible Students. The common people hear with eagerness, realizing that In the strenuous </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">times </span><span class="font5">in which we live, here at last Is the ray of light for which they have looked to their spiritual leaders in vain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Nyasaland many of the natives are interested in the truth. The Society’s representative reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I had a visit recently from Major ----, Chief Commis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sioner of Police. He is a fine man, a modern Gamaliel. He has been investigating our work in Nyasaland. He is disgusted at the amazingly wicked lies circulated about us and told him by the clergy. He stated that he had disguised himself and gone to our meetings amongst the natives. He knows individually all the leaders. He tells me that the truth is spreading like wildfire amongst the natives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books were sold from this branch during the year to the number of 15,820; colporteurs in the field, 6, with hope of an early increase. The manager writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All centers, doubtless stimulated by the stirring articles In recent Issues of The Watch Tower, can be said to be humming with activity. Great Interest is shown in the public meetings in this land, but at these meetings the friends are not permitted to sell books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report of the British branch covers a period of eleven months, but shows up better than any previous report. Books sold during the fiscal year, 225,050; public meetings held, 1,819, with a total attendance of 168,419; class meetings, 4,112, with an attendance cf 139,962; colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs in the field, 220; Pilgrims, 11; free literature distributed, 4,260,802. In addition to the free literature, advertisements for meetings carrying the message in tract form were printed and distributed to the number of 5,332,300. Letters received 32,422; dispatched, 42,535. Quoting from the manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The work during the year has been one of steady progress and continues encouraging. When the fact is remembered that Britain is suffering a very bitter aftermath of the war, that trade is very bad and that all the year past there has been an average of a million people on the unemployed list, it Is wonderful that we can report the past year as the best in the British work. This means that many of the class who have some money to spare have been stirred by the message of the truth, and that many have bought books out of their scarcity of means because they realize that the people who brought them have a message to give; and also that the brethren have been earnest in their endeavors to carry the message to the people and have been blessed by the Lord in their work. The people want instruction. They are crying out for guidance, and In proportion to their need they are ready to listen. There are great numbers of God-fearing people in Britain and Ireland who will yet pay attention to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There have been amongst the Lord’s people continued and special evidences of his purpose to gather his people into unity of the spirit and purpose, such as is seen when all are In one mind and heart to do his will; and his people here also are ready for the Master’s service and to share with their brethren in every land in the work of advertising the King and the kingdom. Never did they see the message so clearly and never was their determination </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to faithfulness more definite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We give below the British financial statement:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">£7,288: 0: 4 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADIAN BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Canadian branch makes its sixth annual report. The Society’s representative says: “While the statistics of the service by no means reflect the fulness of the witness which has taken place, nevertheless to a large degree it reflects the progress of the work here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Public meetings held, 1,177, attended by 145,338; class meetings, 2,027, with an attendance of 83,013; Pilgrims and auxiliary Pilgrims in service, 16; miles traveled, 136,088; letters received, 13,842; dispatched, 17,319; circulars dispatched, 14,653; parcels dispatched, 6,761 ; books sold, 156,134; free literature distributed, 1,371,994; colporteurs in the field, 68. We quote from the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Never was the attendance so large as it has been during the past year, and never was the interest so keen. During the year nine conventions were held and upon each occasion a public witness was arranged, and with one or two exceptions a day given over to special sales. The latter has become a feature at conventions much appreciated by the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our new quarters are well lighted, comfortable, roomy. We have 5,600 feet of floor space—sufficient for our present needs with allowance for further expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The past year has been one in which a very large shaking has taken place in financial circles. Canada has always boasted of her strong financial banking arrangement, but the fallibility of the system has made Itself very manifest this year. The Merchants Bank of Canada, to save liquidation, was absorbed by the Bank of Montreal. The deficits of the Union Bank of Canada were so great that they were required to reduce their reserve fund by four million dollars. The Home Bank of Canada has closed its doors, and it is expected that it will have a shortage of between eight and nine million dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Business conditions generally throughout the Dominion have been gradually growing quieter; building has to a considerable degree slackened down, the result being that there has been a tremendous exodus of skilled labor from Canada to the States. It is estimated that 30 percent of the population of the northern portion of the western provinces have emigrated. Outside of the coal strike in Cape Breton, there have been few labor troubles, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We were all greatly pleased indeed to have had the pleasure of a visit from you during the year. It seemed to have been very timely, and has resulted in much good and great encouragement to the friends as a whole. We think that It has done much to increase their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">enthusiasm </span><span class="font5">for the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Everywhere from coast </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">coast we find </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the friends </span><span class="font5">abounding more and more in the spirit of the Lord, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">joy</span><span class="font5">fully striving to serve him, his cause, and to bear testimony to the incoming kingdom. Manifestly the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord’s </span><span class="font5">blessing is upon their effort.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s work in the French language embraces particularly a part of Switzerland, France, and Belgium, under the management of the Society’s representative at Bern, Switzerland, who in turn is under the supervision of the Central European Office. This office reports the French work during the fiscal year as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books sold, 82,280; public meetings held, 2,130, with an attendance of 173,280; class meetings, 5,044, attended by 51,486; colporteurs in the field, 171; Pilgrims, 8; free literature and tracts distributed, 5,260,910. In his report the representative says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In the whole work we mark a real increase of zeal amongst the friends. We appreciate the great privilege we now have to proclaim the good tidings of the kingdom. Generally the friends go out in groups of five or six for colporteuring, and they sell on Sunday mornings upwards of 250 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The convention at Denain voted unanimously upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">motion expressing loyalty to the Society and its President, and they manifested their firm resolution to work faithfully unto the end and In perfect harmony with the chosen channel of the Lord. They commissioned me quite specially to express to you their message of love and loyalty and to assure you that dally they intercede for you before the throne of grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I visited also the Polish classes In the North of France and studied carefully the conditions in this part of the work; and I am able to tell you, dear Brother Rutherford, that I never in all my life found such favorable conditions for the Lord’s work. They do not know French, their language being Polish; but all of them know German. The language used amongst them is of course Polish ; for the French government does not allow them to use German. To these people the French government had promised mountains of gold. They all came to France, believing that they would have there a very fine position, and they all were very much deceived. In France they have to work much harder and under less favorable conditions than In Silesia, from whence they came. On the other hand, the whole thing is a matter of policy between Poland and France. Poland wants to get rid of the more German elements and France needs them in her own mines, as she is sending the French miners into the Ruhr and driving the German miners away. Already there are about 100,000 Poles in Northern France, and daily more are arriving. I was informed that the French government desires to get 500,000 Poles. All of them are very poor, with large families. Once they are in France, they have not the means necessary to go back to Poland; and they are really slaves. On the other hand, these miners are very much opposed to the orthodox church of Poland. The friends there told me that all the Polish miners had been very well organized in their country, and that the clergy there are the greatest enemies of these organizations of miners, so that most of the miners are against the church. On the contrary, the women </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Still </span><span class="font5">under </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">dominion </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the clergy. The Polish priests have come to Northern France and established themselves. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">was informed that the men do not go to church, but that only women attend. When our friends give a public lecture in Polish, however, the halls are filled with men, and no women are to be seen. I addressed such meetings </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">men in German and had opportunity to see these things personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I organized a service of regular public lectures. There are now some friends there who will carefully prepare public lectures and go regularly to the Polish parts of the country to proclaim the kingdom news. Any of these miners who do not work in the mines are not permitted by the government to stay in the country. They would be unable to find lodging, as all houses belong to the mining companies. So it will be very difficult for a brother to be wholly engaged in the work. But when the miners have night service, they have the entire afternoon and evening free for the Lord’s work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society is sending a Polish brother to Northern France to organize the Polish work there for the spreading of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6">Some two years ago, as was reported through The Watch Tower, some brethren established a printing plant at Bern, Switzerland, operating it on economical terms under contract with the Society. On July 1 last the Society acquired title to the building and this printing plant, increasing the capacity of the plant by adding more modern equipment, the purpose being to get a greater quantity of free literature for Europe. This plant is now operated exclusively for the Society’s literature. In this printery and bookbinding shop and the offices forty people are employed. It publishes The Watch Tower in German and French, and The Golden Age in German and French. Since starting The Golden Age this year there have been printed 242,&lt;532 copies. Mats were sent to Magdeburg, where the same numbers of The Golden Age are printed for Germany. Mats are also sent to Roumania for printing in the German language there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ROUMANIA AND HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work for Roumania and Hungary is managed from the Society’s office at Cluj, Roumania. The brethren there work under great difficulties. Their zeal and earnestness for the Lord and his cause is a real inspiration. The Society’s representative in reporting says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘■The government, which has little respect for liberty and progress, is keeping us continually down by force, imprisonment. beatings, and all other methods of the dark ages. Despite all these, 176 public meetings were held during these ten months—not largely advertised public meetings, which are absolutely impossible in this country. These meetings in the main were held where we had to bargain with police to allow the meetings. Meetings were arranged cautiously; but being in towns of few inhabitants, the simple news that some one had come to their village was enough to gather the people to hear the lecture. Many conventions are held by the brethren, in which they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">much </span><span class="font5">blessed. The colporteur work is continually growing, though this is one of the hardest parts of the work here. Difficulties are with the authorities. They arrest the brethren, take their books, treat them roughly, keep them in dirty jails for two or three days without food, and then send them home on foot, under guard, from post to post, hundreds of miles away. Yet there were during the summer 23 colporteurs constantly in the field, some of whom have now developed into first-class fighters on this front. The number of field workers will grow during the winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The ‘Millions’ book is now entirely forbidden, yet our colporteurs continue to sell them without our knowledge. The Golden Age Is growing. One colporteur alone sells 2,000 of each number and now places an order for 3,500. From time to time we get warnings from the authorities that they will suppress The Golden Age. I told one of these over-zealous officials that if they stop The Golden Age we will start a daily paper. This country is under martial law because of the university students’ movement against the Jews and the Fascist! movement, which has taken hold of all the uncivilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The work in Hungary is going very hard. The present authorities seem to have lost their heads entirely and are going from bad to worse against the brethren. Information received from there a few days ago states that twenty brethren are in jail for distributing the proclamation tract. However, it is our belief that it is the greatest witness for the truth in these countries; and by the Lord’s grace and Help we shall not lie down until it shall be given.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society owns its printing plant in Cluj; otherwise we would be unable to get any literature printed. While the work is done in these countries under great difficulties, the friends are developing into real saints, appreciating the fact that he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOLLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has always been difficult to do much in Holland, but now even that sleepy land is awakening. The work there under the direction of the Central European Office, and more particularly under the management at Amsterdam, is now spreading the truth throughout Holland as it has not been heretofore. The interest is increasing in no uncertain degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swedish work, hindered by adverse conditions during the past year or two, is now making decided progress and we are happy to report that the Swedish work seems in a healthier condition than it has been for quite a while. The brethren have manifested their zeal for the Lord and his cause and their determination to spread the message of the kingdom. Books were sold during the year to the number of 81,421; 1,G84 public meetings were held, with an attendance of 81,878; colporteurs in the field, 20; Pilgrims, 10; free literature distributed during the fiscal year, 533,827.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Sweden is directed from the Society’s office at Orebro. The Society’s representative for Sweden recently visited America, and reported the spreading of the truth on the increase and the condition of the friends good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth in Denmark continues steadily to push forward, yet not so rapidly. The brethren are earnest and zealous and continue faithfully to give the witness for the King and the kingdom. The work is managed from the Society’s branch at Copenhagen. Only two brethren have been actively in the Pilgrim service and nine colporteurs in the field. The classes have likewise engaged in some colporteur work. The Society’s representative reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Amongst the working people very many have been out of work for long periods of time and money has been scarce. This has made it difficult to sell books. Quite a number of new classes have been formed.. There has been much opposition and much written against us, in both the religious and the secular press, and warning given against us in the nominal churches, which I think proves that we have been doing something to let our light shine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books were placed in the hands of the people to the number of 13,007; 265 public meetings were held, with a total attcntance of 30,500; meetings for the friends, 350, attended by 7,500; 198,000 copies of the proclamation were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Norway is directed from the Society’s office at Christiania. The representative in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This year the friends, by the Lord’s grace, have made good progress, especially when we remember that we are small in numbers and the work is more difficult on account of the long distances to be traveled over the many mountains and fjords. The friends are happy and the Lord’s spirit dwells richly amongst us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Norwegian books sold, 12,202; English and other books and booklets, 6,594; free literature distributed, 200,136; letters and post cards received, 1,125; dispatched, 3,847. The work here is making healthy and steady progress and the Lord is blessing the efforts of the brethren to spread the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Detailed report from Einland is delayed. From monthly reports, however, it can be said that the work in Finland during the year has substantially increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s work for Greece is managed from its branch office in Athens. The Greek friends have been working under great difficulties during the past year. The bishops of the state church have great influence, and succeeded in getting an order directing the AttorneyGeneral to prosecute brethren engaged in preaching the truth. This has not deterred the brethren, however, but rather has worked to a further spreading of the truth, arousing the'people to a keener desire to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">know </span><span class="font6">more about it. A brother from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Isle of </span><span class="font6">Crete, associated in the work, concerning activities in Greece writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The editors of the daily paper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Anaffhennessis, of</span><span class="font5"> Thessaly, have been lately converted to the truth and have invited me to visit them. The conversion of many school teachers to the truth, and above- all the editors of this paper, has aroused a serious opposition on the part of the Greek ecclesiastics and the Greek government. The teachers are being denounced as carrying on proselytism. So the Holy Synod of Greece has issued a long circular against us, which circular was read in all the churches of the state and stuck up on the walls. Then the Minister of Justice addressed another circular to the Crown Prosecutors, commanding them to proceed legally against us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have had several meetings and arranged with these editors to turn their paper gradually from a daily political one to a weekly and semi-weekly scientific and religious magazine, according to the desire of these brethren. They are financially independent, their presses, machinery and shops being their own property. They have been supplied with articles for publication and will continue to be supplied. Great efforts must be spent now for the spreading of the truth in Macedonia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society is sending many books and other literature into Greece, and the brethren are manifesting a great amount of zeal in spreading the message throughout that land amidst opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For some time the Society has maintained a branch office at Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies. The local manager reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Words fail me in expressing my gratitude </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to God </span><span class="font5">for all his kind favors bestowed on us through Jesus Christ our Lord. I must also express my gratitude and appreciation for tlie kind interest shown to the Jamaica branch by the Society through the President and his staff of faithful workers. I am glad to report that through the method adopted by the Society our output of books far exceeded that of last year, notwithstanding a financial depression. The service work has been a great impetus to the friends. The world-wide witness lectures have been the means of arousing much interest among the public and a greater demand for literature. The colporteurs, though few, are doing their best. All engaged in the service are rejoicing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books sold during the year, 2,836; magazines, 1,400; free literature distributed, 10,000; public meetings held, 122, with an attendance of 13,309; class meetings, 182, attended by 5,413; letters and cards received, 903; dispatched, 1,503.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year there has been a great impetus given to the truth in the Canal Zone, British and Dutch Guiana, and the brother who recently visited those parts reports about 1,300 consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPANISH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been very difficult to do much amongst the Spanish people, because, we believe, of the influence of the Papacy. The Spanish people do not take readily to things that require serious thought. The Spanish work of the Society for the United States </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and Mexico is </span><span class="font6">managed more particularly from the Los Angeles office under the supervision of the Brooklyn headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books sold, 3,150; public meetings, 20, attended by 1,700; class meetings, 142, with an attendance of 3,051. There are no Spanish colporteurs in the field. The Watch Tower is published in Spanish every other month, which is much appreciated by the Spanish friends. Free literature distributed during the year, 150,000. We rejoice that the Lord is pleased to continue to send the message to the Latin peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALASIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work for Australia and New Zealand is under the management of the Society’s office at Melbourne. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">great impetus has been given the work during the past year, much new interest manifested, and many new ones interested and many brethren developed into more active and zealous workers. Brother M. A. Howlett made an extended trip during the year through Australia and New Zealand. The office reports that this brother alone traveled 24,244 miles; addressed 140 meetings, with a total attendance of 23,466. Continuing the report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The brethren everywhere cooperated loyally and willingly and spent their money freely in securing halls and advertising the meetings, until the ‘Millions’ slogan has become something of a byword and Is finding its way into the wit and humor columns of the Australian and New Zealand papers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time a detailed report of this branch has not yet arrived; hence we cannot give it in full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POLISH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Polish work in the United States has daily increased during the year. This work in the office at Brooklyn is conducted by three brethren, under the supervision of the office manager and under the general supervision of the President of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The headquarters of the Polish work in Europe is at Warsaw. Great difficulties are encountered there for places of meeting, storing of books, etc., and great opposition from the clergy. Nevertheless, the truth has steadily increased. The number of public meetings held during the year has been 209, with a total attendance of 57,698; class meetings, 410, attended by 16,298. Two Pilgrims have been engaged in the service; letters received, 2,015; dispatched, 3,685; books sold, 49,870. In Galicia the friends are no longer able to obtain halls in which to meet and they are meeting in the woods. Nevertheless the truth attracts more and more. The work of the American Polish Branch will be reported in the Polish Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in India during the year has increased. The literature is now translated into a number of the dialects, and a greater quantity of books and free literature is going out amongst the people. The Society’s representative at Kottayam in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As the truth is spreading in all directions the clergy are embittered, misrepresenting us to the people; but the earnest ones who are anxious to know the truth are not deceived. The Y. M. C. A. and the Church of England are lecturing against us; but now there is a split in the Church of England. Requests for literature increase. Owing to the poverty in India, we are not able to encourage much colporteur work. Public meetings held 134, attendance 26,740. The work is in good condition and steadily increasing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PALESTINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s branch office is maintained at Ramallah, near Jerusalem. There are about fifteen consecrated in this class, mostly Arabians; two Jews in Jerusalem also being deeply interested in the truth. These friends are zealous and have distributed much free literature over Palestine during the year. More than 4,000 of the “Millions” books have been placed in the hands of the people. Public meetings held, seven, with a total attendance of 350. Conditions are difficult, yet the friends are zealous, doing what they can by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Korea the Society’s headquarters is at Seoul. As it is difficult to get the truth printed in the Korean language, the Society established a small printing plant at Seoul; and now we are able to print the message in the pure Korean and Mixed Script, besides being equipped to print in Japanese and Chinese. There has been a healthy and steady increase in the truth in Korea, several ministers having shown much interest, while the natives have responded more readily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains a branch at Vienna, Austria. A few years ago there was no one in the truth there; and now there is a class of more than one hundred consecrated and many smaller classes throughout the country. A great amount of literature has been placed in the hands of the people during the last twelve months. Like other parts of the continental Europe they have been hampered for funds, and the home office has been furnishing them through the Central European Office what funds have been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth is now beginning to make some progress in Jugoslavia. In the Belgrade district there is a class </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">thirty or more consecrated who are very zealous in spreading the message. Those who hear the message are greatly rejoicing and some are disposing of their property to enable them to enter the colporteur service. Verily the Lord is sending the gospel of the kingdom </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">every country of “Christendom” before the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the fiery trials of 1917 and 1918 caused quite </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">number who had worked in harmony with the Society to turn aside and follow a different course, yet the Lord quickly filled up the ranks with new recruits and brought in even more. Reports of those that commemorated the Memorial in 1923 were far greater than those of any previous year during the harvest period. From 1904 to 1922 the greatest number of colporteurs in the field at any one time was 650; while the greatest number of bound volumes sold during any one year was 728,478. In 1923 the largest number of colporteurs in the service at any one time was 921; and the total sales of clothbound books by the colporteurs for the past year aggregate 1,241,570. This is by far the greatest record ever made in the United States. The Lord’s hand has surely been in the work and “a marvelous work he hath done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More and more the brethren appreciate the fact that it is their privilege to announce the new government of Christ Jesus the Messiah, that which will bring peace and rest and life to mankind. Their love for the Lord and his cause has spurred them on to greater efforts this year. While the contributions to the “Good Hopes” fund have been in excess of what they were a year ago, the classes throughout the United States in particular, and also many other countries, have expended large sums of money in preparing for a public witness and giving the same. It is impossible to estimate the amount of money spent by the friends in this way; but it has all been spent to a good purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the classes have considered each week the prayer-meeting texts relating to the transformation of the new creature into the likeness of the Lord and Master, by keeping the mind fixed upon the Lord and striving to cooperate with him in this transforming work. The influence has been such that visible effects are manifested by the brethren. It is easy to be seen that the classes generally throughout the country are in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">good spiritual condition, have entered into the joy of the Lord, and are doing whatsoever their hands find to do with gladness, looking to that blessed time when all the faithful ones shall enter the habitation of the saints in glory, there to dwell in the house of the Lord forever, to behold his beauty and to inquire in his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The kingdom of heaven is at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hand. Of that we are </span><span class="font6">quite certain. No greater privilege was ever granted to men or angels than that of now telling to the world that the great Messiah is here, has taken unto himself his power and will establish a government that will bring the desire of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us gird on our armor and with renewed zeal and determination press on during the year that is just before us, rejoicing as we go; and the God of heaven whom we serve will fight our battles for us and will bring us through victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ELECTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately following the report, which was received with unanimous approval, the order of business proceeded to the election of the Board of Directors and Officers of the Society. Brother Sexton gaining recognition, said: “It was my privilege four years ago to place in nomination the officers of this Society. The splendid record made during that time and particularly as shown by the report we have just heard warrants me in concluding that the Lord was pleased with that nomination and has been blessing the servants of the Society. I, therefore, take pleasure in nominating for Directors the follow ing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J. F. Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">C. A. Wise</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W. E. Van Amburgh</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. H. Macmillan Hugo H. Riemer J. A. Baeuerlein C. H. Anderson”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no other nominations these were elected by unanimous vote. The share-holders then proceeded to the nomination of the election of officers and the following were unanimously elected, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For President, J. F. Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For Vice-President, C. A. Wise</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For Secretary-Treasurer, W. E. Van Amburgh</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no further business the annual meeting adjourned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark17"></a>CHRISTMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">“To give some little token of affection’s warmth To those whose lives are rich in what is best; To give the hungry food, the tired rest, Call back the blush of youth to faded cheek; To bring a glint of joy to eyes grown dim, Or sing a hymn of praise for those whose cares And plodding toil have never yet been sung; To clasp the stranger’s hand like that of friend And feel his heart beat full with brother’s love; “To open wide the doors of vision and of thought For those whose souls are starving for the truth, And bid them welcome to a stronger hope;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To give our better selves to those most dear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To stand alone with God and life among The quiet hills, beneath a heaven of stars, Too full of joy for words or song— All this was taught us in thy birth, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font6">Son of God and man I”</span></p>

Millions Are Going—Are You?
Going where? To the annual observance of the death of Jesus Christ. In 1996 a worldwide total of 12,921,933 attended.
Why do people go? Because of what the death of Jesus means for humankind. It means relief from sickness, suffering, and death. Even dead loved ones will be resurrected to life on an earth restored to Paradise.
How can the death of Jesus Christ bring such blessings? You are invited to find out. Jehovah’s Witnesses welcome you to meet with them during this important event.
Attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. This year the date is Sunday, March 23, after sunset. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time.

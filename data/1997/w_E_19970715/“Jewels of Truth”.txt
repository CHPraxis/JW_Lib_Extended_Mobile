“Jewels of Truth”
“Jewels of truth.” That is how a letter to the Nigeria branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses describes two special magazines. The writer, a young man, explains:
“I am writing to express my sincere thanks for your efforts in touching virtually all aspects of day-to-day life through the Watchtower and Awake! magazines.
“I am 17 years old. Last year a local radio station set up an essay competition on the theme ‘There Is More to Love Than Sex—AIDS Is Real.’ Each essay was to be not less than four hundred words. A prize of 1,000 naira [$12.50, U.S.] was to be given for the best essay. Of course, they said, people should write not just to win a prize but, rather, to learn something. . . .
“I found information about AIDS in both magazines. Concerning love, there was an inexhaustible array of articles. I used points from Awake! of August 8, 1978.
“Barely two months after sending in my essay, the results came out. To my surprise, I came in first in the states of Cross River and Akwa Ibom!
“All the information I used came from the magazines. It is really marvelous that Jehovah provides timely information for us in this troubled and sick world. As true Christians, we know that there is much, much more to love than sex. And, of course, living a clean, moral life protects us from diseases like AIDS.
“I can’t help thanking you for these jewels of truth that you tirelessly produce. May Jehovah continue to bless your efforts as you continuously provide these precious magazines.”

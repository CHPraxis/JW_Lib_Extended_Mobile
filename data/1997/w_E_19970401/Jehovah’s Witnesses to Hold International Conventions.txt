Jehovah’s Witnesses to Hold International Conventions
The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses is planning to hold international conventions during 1998. This announcement met with an enthusiastic response at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, held at the Jersey City Assembly Hall on Saturday, October 5, 1996.
Along with the usual district conventions, a number of international conventions will be held in North America during the middle of 1998. It is expected that these gatherings will bring together hundreds of thousands of Witnesses from many parts of the earth. To allow as many lands as possible to be represented, each of the more than 100 branch offices of the Watch Tower Society will have an allotment of delegates for a designated international convention city in North America.
Obviously, not all who would like to travel to North America will be able to do so. However, it may be possible for thousands to attend an international convention closer to their home. Arrangements are being made for international conventions to be held in two or three countries in Europe and others in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the South Pacific, and the Caribbean.
At an appropriate time, the Society’s branch offices will advise congregations in their respective territories about the convention city or cities to which they are invited. Information will be given concerning convention dates and the arrangements for selecting delegates. Those who have in mind filling out applications for delegate selection may wish to start saving some of their funds in anticipation of these special events.
All of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide can look forward to what is in store at these international gatherings for 1998. District conventions in all countries will carry a similar program.

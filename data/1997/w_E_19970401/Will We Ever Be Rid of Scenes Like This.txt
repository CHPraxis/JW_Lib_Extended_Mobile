Will We Ever Be Rid of Scenes Like This?
WHEREVER we turn these days, we see images of tension, conflict, and war. But it is not the purpose of this magazine to add to all the bad news that you already know. Rather, this special issue will introduce to you at least two comforting truths. First, that ancient prophecies in the Bible actually foretold much of the shocking bad news of our era; second, that this same book of prophecy foretells a day when such scenes as the one pictured here will belong to the past. No more wars. No more bombings, snipers, land mines, or terrorism. No more anguished orphans or homeless refugees. A world of genuine, heart-soothing peace. Would you like to see such a time? We urge you to consider what the Bible has to say. You may find more comfort there than you ever thought possible.

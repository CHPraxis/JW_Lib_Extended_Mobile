<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Would you answer yes to this question? Although not all of Jehovah’s dedicated servants can be enrolled in the full-time ministry, is it not reasonable to expect that all of us should view ourselves as his full-time Witnesses? Certainly we should.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>There is no such thing as a part-time Christian. Jesus said of his Father: “I always do the things pleasing to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:29-43:8:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:29</a>) Paul, who felt the same way, urged us to “do all things for God’s glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31</a>) By all means then, all of us should regard ourselves as full-time Witnesses of Jehovah. Our thinking in this way will influence us for good in every activity we pursue.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Consider the Evidence: </strong>Our appearance, speech, and conduct can indicate to other people that we are indeed Jehovah’s Witnesses. We are conscious of the need for a modest appearance, wholesome speech, and proper conduct whenever we are engaging in field service or attending Christian meetings. However, whether we are going to school, working at a secular job, or participating in recreation, everything about us should give evidence that we live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus said: “A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. . . . Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14-16</a>) This should be true in everything we do and at all times. If we ever find that we are reluctant to give a witness because of where we are or what we are doing, we need to ask ourselves, ‘Am I serving Jehovah part-time or full-time?’ May we never have to pass up an opportunity to talk to others about the good news of God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Remember, we honor and please Jehovah when we can answer the question, “Are you a full-time Witness?” with a resounding “Yes!”</p>

Are You a Full-Time Witness?
1 Would you answer yes to this question? Although not all of Jehovah’s dedicated servants can be enrolled in the full-time ministry, is it not reasonable to expect that all of us should view ourselves as his full-time Witnesses? Certainly we should.
2 There is no such thing as a part-time Christian. Jesus said of his Father: “I always do the things pleasing to him.” (John 8:29) Paul, who felt the same way, urged us to “do all things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) By all means then, all of us should regard ourselves as full-time Witnesses of Jehovah. Our thinking in this way will influence us for good in every activity we pursue.
3 Consider the Evidence: Our appearance, speech, and conduct can indicate to other people that we are indeed Jehovah’s Witnesses. We are conscious of the need for a modest appearance, wholesome speech, and proper conduct whenever we are engaging in field service or attending Christian meetings. However, whether we are going to school, working at a secular job, or participating in recreation, everything about us should give evidence that we live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.
4 Jesus said: “A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. . . . Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matt. 5:14-16) This should be true in everything we do and at all times. If we ever find that we are reluctant to give a witness because of where we are or what we are doing, we need to ask ourselves, ‘Am I serving Jehovah part-time or full-time?’ May we never have to pass up an opportunity to talk to others about the good news of God’s Kingdom.
5 Remember, we honor and please Jehovah when we can answer the question, “Are you a full-time Witness?” with a resounding “Yes!”

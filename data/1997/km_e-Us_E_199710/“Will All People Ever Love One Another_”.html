<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A beautiful, stirring, and heartwarming message is to be proclaimed worldwide in 169 languages. What is this message? And how will it be delivered?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The message is about neighbor love. It is to be found in <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 35, entitled “Will All People Ever Love One Another?” This <em>Kingdom News </em>briefly examines the present state of affairs throughout the world, showing that it is the lack of love among people that is the root cause of so much heartache and pain. It explains why, in our day particularly, neighbor love has cooled off and what this means for the future.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>At the same time, <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 35 shows that true neighbor love exists among millions living in today’s world. It identifies those who are sharing in the revival of primitive Christianity​—first-century worship, which was marked by love of neighbor as taught by Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:25-42:10:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><em>Kingdom News </em>No. 35 concludes with an explanation of how the entire world of mankind will soon be practicing neighbor love under the administration of God’s Kingdom by Christ. Those reading this message are encouraged to obtain the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>and learn how to become a part of this earth-wide loving arrangement that is described in detail in God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Who Will Deliver This Message? </strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide will be sharing this message of neighbor love with their acquaintances, neighbors, and relatives during the months of October and November. All who qualify are encouraged to share in the public distribution of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 35.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The ultimate goal of this campaign is to stimulate people’s interest in having a Bible study in either the <em>Require </em>brochure or the <em>Knowledge </em>book. Additionally, a wholehearted effort on the part of each one of Jehovah’s servants will produce a grand witness to the God of love, Jehovah, and to his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

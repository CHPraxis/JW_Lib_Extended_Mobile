“Do Your Utmost”
1 When we dedicated ourselves to Jehovah, we promised to give our very best to him. Appropriately, the apostle Peter encouraged first-century Christians to do their utmost in making sure of their standing before Jehovah. (2 Pet. 1:10) We surely want to do our utmost to please Jehovah in serving him today. What does this entail? As our relationship with Jehovah deepens and we meditate on all that he has done for us, our heart moves us always to do our best in his service. We want to improve the quality and, where possible, increase the quantity of our ministry.​—Ps. 34:8; 2 Tim. 2:15.
2 A young brother who wanted to do more in the ministry found that a regular study of God’s Word deepened his appreciation for Jehovah and instilled in him greater zeal. This motivated him to apply for the pioneer service. A sister who found it hard to talk to strangers practiced some of the presentations in the Reasoning book and soon began to enjoy greater success in her ministry. She was able to conduct a Bible study with a couple who accepted the truth.
3 Rejoice in What You Can Do: Some of us experience difficult circumstances such as poor health, family opposition, poverty, or unresponsiveness in the territory. Many other problems that are common in these last days may hinder our service. (Luke 21:34, ftn.; 2 Tim. 3:1) Does this mean we have failed in our dedication to Jehovah? Not if we are serving him to our utmost.
4 It is not wise to judge ourselves based on what others are able to accomplish. Instead, the Scriptures encourage us to “let each one prove what his own work is.” Giving of ourselves fully to the extent that we are personally able pleases Jehovah and gives us “cause for exultation.”​—Gal. 6:4; Col. 3:23, 24.
5 May we heed Peter’s words to ‘do our utmost to be found finally by God spotless and unblemished and in peace.’ (2 Pet. 3:14) That spirit will make us feel secure and will bring us the peace of mind that only Jehovah can give.​—Ps. 4:8.

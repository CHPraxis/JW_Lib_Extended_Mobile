Do All Religions Lead to God?
Millions of people believe that all religions are different paths leading to the same place. The fact is, the teachings, rituals, and deities of religions are similar. Look, for instance, at this eighth-century C.E. statue of a Hindu mythological character, from Kerala, India.
What is remarkable is that bulls were worshiped in many ancient religions. For example, according to first-century B.C.E. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, the Ammonite god Molech also had the form of a man but the head of a bull.
Why have there been remarkable similarities in many diverse religions throughout the world? Do these religions have a common origin? Are they really only different roads leading to the same place? Does God approve of all of them?
The fascinating account of the origin and development of the world’s major religions in the book Mankind’s Search for God answers such questions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT history, millions of people have endured the burden of slavery. Thousands of years ago, the Israelites, for example, suffered greatly at the hands of Egyptian overseers. As the Bible says, they “put slave-drivers over the Israelites to wear them down under heavy loads,” particularly at making bricks.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:11-2:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 1:11</a>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In many countries today, people may not slave in a literal sense, but many have to work long hours under demanding—sometimes hostile—conditions. They are under the heavy burden of what might be called economic slavery.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is, however, one form of slavery that is not burdensome. The apostle Paul urged fellow believers: “Slave for the Master, Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:24-51:3:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:24</a>) Those who choose to become slaves of Christ find relief from their heavy loads. Jesus himself said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Accepting Christ’s yoke does not free one from the obligation to provide materially for one’s family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) It does, however, offer freedom from many of the entanglements of materialistic pursuits. Rather than making material comfort their main goal in life, Christians find contentment with basic necessities.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Christians also find refreshment in fulfilling their responsibility of preaching the “good news” of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) This brings real joy and satisfaction!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We should be thankful that we can “slave for the Master, Christ”!</p>

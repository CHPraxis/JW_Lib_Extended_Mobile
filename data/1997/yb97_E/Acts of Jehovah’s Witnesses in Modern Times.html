<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Benin</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From Benin, West Africa, many thousands were sold into slavery from the 17th to the 19th century. But those remaining were held in an even more diabolic form of slavery. A 14-year ban was imposed on the activity of those who endeavored to provide help by teaching Bible truth. Read this eyewitness report of what happened when the ban was imposed and what has been taking place since it was lifted.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Brazil</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The majority of Brazilians profess Catholicism, and a high percentage of these also incline toward spiritism. Up to 50 years ago, most of them had never seen a Bible. But now people throughout Brazil are being given opportunity to see for themselves what God’s Word contains. And some of the largest conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses in modern times have been held in Brazil.</p>

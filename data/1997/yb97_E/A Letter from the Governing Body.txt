A Letter from the Governing Body
WHEN the 70 “returned with joy” to report to Jesus on the success of their preaching campaign, he himself “became overjoyed in the holy spirit.” Thanking Jehovah, he said: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones, and have revealed them to babes.”—Luke 10:17, 21.
Like Jesus, are we not overjoyed at the annual report for 1996? We too are like babes nurtured by Jehovah’s spirit, but the wise and intellectual ones of this world cannot begin to approach what Jehovah has accomplished through his people. Throughout the past service year, we exerted ourselves to “become doers of the word.” (Jas. 1:22) As a result, Jehovah ‘opened the floodgates of the heavens’ and added an overflowing blessing.—Mal. 3:10.
A further reason for this blessing is that we have ‘clothed ourselves with love, the perfect bond of union.’ (Col. 3:14) This is reflected in the remarkable unity of activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses the world over. Like the locust horde of Joel’s prophecy, the mighty army of Jehovah’s Witnesses, now 5,413,769 strong, continues to fill the earth with its witnessing.—Joel 1:1-4; 2:7, 9-11.
Yes, 1996 has brought forth an outstanding crop of Kingdom fruitage—well over a billion hours in field service, a new peak of 366,579 new brothers and sisters baptized, and the astounding figure of 543,667,923 magazines distributed. However, these figures are merely a reflection of what is happening in the hearts and lives of millions who are flocking to Jehovah’s worldwide organization. (Isa. 2:2-4; 60:8-11) Never have Jesus’ words had greater application: “Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.”—John 4:35.
In harvesting this Kingdom fruitage today, the Lord Jesus is interested in assembling a clean people who will follow the pattern provided by his anointed brothers in pursuing true holiness on earth. (Isa. 35:8-10; Rom. 6:19, 22, 23) All such not only dedicate their lives to Jehovah but also cultivate “the fruitage of the spirit,” developing “the new personality.” They ‘wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb.’—Gal. 5:22, 23; Eph. 4:23, 24; Rev. 7:9, 14; 14:15, 16.
Thus, in harvesting Kingdom fruitage, Jesus is interested not only in quantity—the number of those gathered—but also in quality. He is looking for loyal servants who will measure up to Jehovah’s standards of righteousness, making Kingdom interests their number-one priority in life. Does a personal examination of your field service and your meeting attendance show that Kingdom interests come first in your life? As David emphasized in prayer to Jehovah: “With someone loyal you will act in loyalty.”—Ps. 18:25; Matt. 6:31-33.
Jesus made it plain that “narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” (Matt. 7:13, 14) We must heed that warning! If we wish to qualify for eternal life, we must be wholehearted in applying God’s Word in our lives. (John 17:3) This will include paying close attention to our yeartext for 1997, which reads: “Teach me to do your will.” (Ps. 143:10) Yes, regularly, on a daily and weekly basis, we must avail ourselves of all the provisions and instruments Jehovah has made available for teaching us. They are for our protection.—Isa. 50:4, 5; 54:13, 14.
Satan’s world is sinking farther and farther into the bog of filth, demon-inspired lawlessness and violence, as well as hatred of authority and of one another. It is trying to drag all mankind down with it. Therein lies great danger for God’s people. The world’s entertainment is filled with lewdness, immorality, raucous “melodies,” and corrupting lyrics. We must avoid this Satanic propaganda, these “unclean . . . expressions inspired by demons,” which will lead not only rulers but also all others who make themselves “part of the world” to ruin at Armageddon.—Rev. 16:13-16; John 15:19; 17:14, 16; 18:36. 
Yes, the distractions of the world—its associations, its peer pressure, its pride, its materialistic desires—are all due for extinction in the near future. (1 Cor. 15:33; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10) The aged apostle John wisely stated: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—1 John 2:15-17.
As we rejoice in having “become doers of the word” during 1996, may our prayers and deeds be in harmony with our yeartext for 1997: “Teach me to do your will.”—Ps. 143:10.
With the warmest Christian love to our international coworkers,
Your brothers,
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

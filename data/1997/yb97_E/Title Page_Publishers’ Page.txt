1997 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 1996
“Teach me to do your will.”
That earnest prayer, recorded at Psalm 143:10, is our yeartext for 1997. It should be the fervent desire of each one of us to be taught by Jehovah so that we really learn how to do, not our own will, but the will of God.

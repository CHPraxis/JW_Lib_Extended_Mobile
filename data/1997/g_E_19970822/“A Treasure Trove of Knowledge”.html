<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man who works with <em>THENEWS </em>magazine of Lagos, Nigeria, wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in that country and described <em>Awake! </em>in the above terms. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Each time I read a copy of <em>Awake!, </em>I have the urge to write you. But often, when I was on the threshold of writing the letter, another equally good, in fact better, copy of the magazine would arrive and entrance me all over again.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The bottom line of all this? <em>Awake! </em>is, to my mind, a treasure trove of knowledge. I have rarely seen a publication so rich, so beautiful, so balanced, and so skillfully packaged. It is an invaluable gift to mankind.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“From the bottom of my heart, I wish to say this: Thank you a million times. Keep up the wonderful work.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We are confident that you too will benefit from reading <em>Awake! </em>If you would like to receive another copy or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

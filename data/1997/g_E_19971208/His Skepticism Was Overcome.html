<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When a young man on the Caribbean island of Jamaica was met by Jehovah’s Witnesses, he was very skeptical regarding the existence of God and denied the inspiration of the Bible. However, he reluctantly accepted a copy of the book <em>The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>Return visits were made on him, but he finally told the Witnesses not to come back until he invited them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Months later,” the Witnesses reported, “he telephoned and asked many questions. But he was still critical of the Bible’s answers.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In time, a copy of the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>was left with the young man, and a regular study of the Bible was started with him. Shortly after that, he commented: “Now I can see why a study like this is necessary.” He was so enthusiastic about what he was learning that he asked to study twice a week. Soon he began attending Christian meetings regularly.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The faith of millions has been strengthened by reading <em>The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>and by studying the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>If you would like to have a copy of these books or would like to have someone conduct a home Bible study with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

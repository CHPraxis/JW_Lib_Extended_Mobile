<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ In order to get the most out of congregation studies in the <em>Greatest Man </em>book, please consider the excellent guidelines appearing on <a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:201992320/1-9$p/E:201992321/1-7">page 1 of the September 1992 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry</em></a><em>. </em>The article explains how to prepare each lesson and the format the Congregation Book Study will follow.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Ever since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established in 1983, the brothers have contributed generously, thus enabling loans to be made for Kingdom Hall construction. Already some 2,700 congregations in this country have benefited from this arrangement. Many congregations could not otherwise build new Kingdom Halls or renovate those in need of repair. There is now an urgent need to use some of these contributed funds to provide loans to congregations in economically depressed countries. Your continued support of this arrangement is greatly appreciated by the Society and by those congregations that benefit from your contributions.</p>

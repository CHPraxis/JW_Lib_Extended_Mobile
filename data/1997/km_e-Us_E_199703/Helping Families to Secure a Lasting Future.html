<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Greed is healthy,” a financier told a college graduating class, adding: “You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” That is typical of how the world promotes self-interest as the way to ensure one’s future. In sharp contrast, Jesus taught that a Christian must “disown himself . . . for what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24-26</a>) To secure a lasting future, a person must center his whole life on doing the will of God​—the most important goal for families today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:10-19:143:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 143:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:8</a>) That message is conveyed in the concluding chapter of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>This new publication helps people see what really matters in life and how they can act beneficially toward their families. As we continue to preach the good news everywhere, what can we say that will encourage those we meet to read the <em>Family Happiness </em>book? Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>Both at the door and on the street, you might try using the tract “Enjoy Family Life” to start conversations. You could ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“With all the anxieties that modern living brings upon us, do you feel that it is possible to have a really happy family life? [Allow for response.] This tract assures us that it is possible. Would you like to read it?” If it is accepted, you could continue by saying: “Since you are interested in this subject, you may also enjoy this book that provides detailed advice on how to find happiness in the family circle.” Show the table of contents in the <em>Family Happiness </em>book. Point out a few eye-catching chapter titles. Turn to page 10, and read from the last sentence of paragraph 17 to the end of paragraph 18. Offer the book, and mention the donation arrangement. Explain that you have more to share, and ask when you could get in touch again.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You could follow up your initial conversation about happy family life by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I would like to point out something in the book you obtained that I think you will appreciate. The last chapter focuses on the real secret of family happiness. [Read paragraph 2 on page 183.] Note that working together to do God’s will is the key. We recommend that families study the Bible together to learn what God’s will is and how to apply it in the household. We offer a free Bible study course that takes only a few months to complete. If you will allow me, I’ll show you how it’s conducted.” Return with the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>or the <em>Knowledge </em>book, whichever would be more appropriate.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When talking to classmates at school or to youths in the territory, you might get a response to this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“How important is it for parents and their children to keep open the lines of communication with one another? [Allow for response.] Notice what this handbook on family life says about the subject of ‘Honest and Open Communication.’ [Read all of paragraph 4 and the first sentence of <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996025/8-8">paragraph 5 on page 65 in the <em>Family Happiness</em></a> book.] The paragraphs that follow provide practical suggestions on how to improve communication within a family. This book is entitled <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>If you would like to read it and promise to do so, you may have this copy to keep.” Explain that you will follow up later to get his comments on what he reads.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You could build on your initial conversation with a youth about parent-child communication by saying this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I appreciated the interest you showed in the importance of having good communication within your family. What would you say is the most important subject that parents and children should discuss?” Allow for response. Then turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="40" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996025/13-15:612">page 68 in the <em>Family Happiness</em></a> book, and read the answer that is found in the first half of paragraph 11. “Having a weekly Bible study is an excellent way to acquire knowledge of God.” Present the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>Explain that its 16 lessons provide a basic outline of the Bible’s message. Read the introduction on page 2, and then discuss together the first lesson.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>If you meet a parent in the house-to-house work, or perhaps at a park or a playground, you might arouse interest by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I’m sure you’ll agree that rearing children today is a real challenge. What do you think can protect your family from unwholesome influences? [Allow for response.] Here is some sound advice that I have appreciated.” Relate the illustration in paragraph 1, and read <a class="xt" data-xtid="41" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996027/4-4">paragraph 2 on page 90 in the <em>Family Happiness</em></a> book. Explain how it gives balanced direction that really works to protect families from destructive influences. Offer to leave a copy, and make yourself available to answer any questions that arise.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>On your second visit with a parent who accepted the “Family Happiness” book, you could continue the conversation in this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“When we first met, I could see that you genuinely care about your children and that you want to do all you can to protect them from wrong influences. You may not have read it yet, but there is a very important observation made in the book I left with you that you should see. [Read paragraph 19 on page 59.] Developing a relationship with God requires our getting to know him through the pages of his written Word, the Bible. Would you like to have me demonstrate how we study the Bible as a family?”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Worldly advisers cannot show families the way to happiness but will surely leave them disappointed. Let us give the <em>Family Happiness </em>book wide distribution so that people everywhere can be helped by God’s Word to secure a lasting future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:19</a>.</p>

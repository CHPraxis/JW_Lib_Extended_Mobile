North America to Host International Conventions in 1998
As was announced on Saturday, OctoberÂ 5, 1996, at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the Governing Body is planning to hold international conventions during 1998. Along with the usual district conventions, a number of international conventions will be held in North America as well as in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean area, and the South Pacific.
Several of these special conventions will be held in North America, and delegates from around the world will be invited. Also, we can anticipate having missionaries at these international conventions. Missionaries and others in foreign special service who qualify will be invited to attend one of these conventions in or near their home country.
Additional information regarding dates, locations, delegate qualifications, arrangements for foreign delegates, and other details will be forthcoming. There will be opportunity for a limited number of delegates from the United States to attend international conventions in other countries. Those publishers having in mind filling out applications for delegate selection may wish to start saving some of their funds in anticipation of these special events.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: The Secret of Family Happiness. April and May: Individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! For midweek service and in territory that is covered frequently, the brochure What Does God Require Of Us? may be used. June: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Concentrate on starting home Bible studies.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The special public talk for the Memorial season this year will be presented in most congregations on Sunday, April 6. The talk is entitled “Keep Clean From Worldly Defilements.” All of us should attend, and we should assist interested ones who came to the Memorial to be present for the talk.
▪ In order to get the most out of congregation studies in the Greatest Man book, please consider the excellent guidelines appearing on page 1 of the September 1992 Our Kingdom Ministry. The article explains how to prepare each lesson and the format the Congregation Book Study will follow.
▪ Ever since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established in 1983, the brothers have contributed generously, thus enabling loans to be made for Kingdom Hall construction. Already some 2,700 congregations in this country have benefited from this arrangement. Many congregations could not otherwise build new Kingdom Halls or renovate those in need of repair. There is now an urgent need to use some of these contributed funds to provide loans to congregations in economically depressed countries. Your continued support of this arrangement is greatly appreciated by the Society and by those congregations that benefit from your contributions.

A Book That Is Loved Best
Books We Love Best, published about five years ago in California, U.S.A., is a compilation of comments by young people about the books that they like best. One youth chose Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work as the book she liked best. The young writer explained why:
‘This wonderful book is about questions and answers youths ask themselves today like, “Why don’t my parents understand me?” “Should I try drugs or alcohol?” “How do I know it’s true love?” “What’s in my future?” “What about sex before marriage?” Those are a few of the chapter titles in this book. I liked this book because it not only has personal questions in it but answers them in easy answers that keep you satisfied. The kids would like it.’
Alcohol and drugs were used as examples of the temptations facing youths today. ‘Magazines and T.V. programs show drinks and alcohol that make you want to take them,’ the youngster explained. ‘Other youths and teens tempt you to take them. So no wonder kids seem confused about what to do. This book answers those kinds of questions. So now you know why I love this book. My mother and I always study it together on Thursdays. We are about halfway through the book now.’

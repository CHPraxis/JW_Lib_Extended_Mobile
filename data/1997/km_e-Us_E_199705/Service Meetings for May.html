<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</p>

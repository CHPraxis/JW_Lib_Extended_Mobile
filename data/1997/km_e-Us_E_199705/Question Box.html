<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>What cautions are needed when we are in association with someone of the opposite sex in connection with our ministry?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We have reason to expect that our brothers and sisters intend to adhere to the highest moral standard in their personal conduct. Nevertheless, we live in an unclean and permissive world that has few moral limitations. While we may have the best of intentions, we must be on guard constantly to avoid causing reproach or getting involved in something improper. This includes being careful while engaged in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In field service we often encounter people of the opposite sex who manifest what appears to be a sincere interest in the truth. If we are alone when we make the call and there is no one else at home, usually it would be best to give a witness at the door rather than go inside. If there is interest, arrangements can be made to return when we will be accompanied by another publisher or when others in the household will be present also. If this is not possible, it would be wise to turn the call over to a publisher of the same sex as the householder. This also applies to conducting Bible studies with someone of the opposite sex.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We need to be careful when choosing someone to work with in the ministry. Although publishers of the opposite sex may work together at times, this is best done when with a group. Ordinarily, even while in the ministry, it is not wise for us to be spending time alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not our marriage mate. Hence, the brother in charge of the service group should use good judgment when assigning publishers, including teenagers, to work together.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By always using good judgment, we will avoid “giving any cause for stumbling” to either ourselves or others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3</a>.</p>

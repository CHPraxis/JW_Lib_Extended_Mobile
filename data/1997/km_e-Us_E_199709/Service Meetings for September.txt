17 min: How to Start a Conversation. Much of our success in the ministry depends on our being able to engage other people in meaningful conversations. When we are able to say something that gets others to listen, we have overcome one of the biggest barriers we face in witnessing. Discuss with audience key points in the School Guidebook, study 16, paragraphs 11-14. Have publishers who are skilled and effective in starting conversations relate the opening words they use when speaking to such people as (1) a pedestrian on the street, (2) a passenger on a bus, (3) a clerk behind a counter, (4) a shopper in a parking lot, (5) a person on a park bench, and (6) someone being contacted in telephone witnessing.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What are some important things that are vital to our spiritual well-being? These would surely include personal study, meeting attendance, persistent prayer, good association, and the Christian ministry. We cannot maintain good spiritual health without keeping important things foremost in our lives.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>However, all of us have a battle against fleshly desires and have a need for discipline. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:17-48:5:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 5:17</a>) Never should we feel that there is more to be gained by pursuing selfish interests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 17:9</a>) Therefore, if we are to safeguard our heart and avoid being misled, regular self-examination is crucial.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 13:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Examine Your Own Heart: </strong>You can do this by asking yourself some candid questions: Do I long to read God’s Word? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2</a>) Do I appreciate the importance of attending all the congregation meetings? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Do I persevere in prayer? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) Do I seek the company of spiritually minded people? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12</a>) Do I feel a personal obligation to declare the good news? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:16-46:9:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:16</a>) Positive answers will show that you are desirous of putting the more important things first.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Examine Your Daily Routine: </strong>You need to follow up the examination of your heart’s desires by establishing priorities for the use of time. This includes scheduling time for regularly reading the Bible and every issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>as well as for preparing for the meetings. Time must also be set aside for the family both to study and to pray together. Set a limit on how much time is spent in front of the TV or the computer. Be determined to attend all congregation meetings, and arrange everything else around them. Plan for the whole family to share in the field service each week.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Without a doubt, setting the more important things first in our life will prove to be a cause for joy.</p>

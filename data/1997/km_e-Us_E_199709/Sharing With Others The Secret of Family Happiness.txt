Sharing With Others The Secret of Family Happiness
1 The family is the basic unit of human society, and from the family come villages, cities, states, and whole nations. Today the family unit is under pressure as never before. Powerful forces are at work threatening the very existence of family life. How thankful we are that Jehovah, the Designer of the family arrangement, has provided us with instructions so that we can achieve family happiness! Those who follow his guidelines find that problems are minimized and a successful family unit results. During September we have the privilege of sharing with others the book The Secret of Family Happiness. Take the initiative to approach people on the subject of family life. Be friendly, positive, and discerning. What might you say?
2 You could begin by raising a question such as:
▪ “Have you noticed that many families are finding it difficult to endure the pressures of life? [Allow for response.] Reports indicate that many people experience difficulties in the home. What do you believe would help families to find greater stability and happiness? [Allow for response.] Since God instituted the family arrangement, would it not be reasonable to examine the guidelines that he has given? [Read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.] Such beneficial instruction is outlined in this book, The Secret of Family Happiness.” Then ask the individual what he feels is a common family problem, show the chapter that discusses that problem, and offer the book.
3 On the return visit, you might pursue the goal of starting a Bible study by saying:
▪ “I have thought about what you said on the subject of family life, and I brought you something that I think you will enjoy. [Show the Require brochure, turn to page 16, and read the six questions at the top.] Obviously, each one in the family must do his part to contribute toward family happiness. If you have just a few minutes, I will demonstrate how you can get the most benefit from this information.” Then begin studying lesson 8.
4 Another way to start a discussion is to mention a problem, perhaps by saying:
▪ “Although everyone wants to feel a sense of contentment and satisfaction, it seems many families have not really succeeded in this. What do you think would help them to find true happiness? [Allow for response.] Long ago, the Bible revealed what sort of problems we would see in families today. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] However, the Bible also tells families what to do to resolve these problems and to obtain lasting happiness. Its principles are set out in this book, The Secret of Family Happiness.” Then show the review box at the end of an appropriate chapter, read it, and offer the book.
5 When you return, use the “Require” brochure to start a study. You could say:
▪ “I was impressed with your willingness to examine the Bible’s principles that apply to family life. Experience has shown that the best results are achieved by following the practical counsel found in the Bible. Here is a simple explanation of why that is so.” Read the first paragraph of lesson 1 in the Require brochure, including either Psalm 1:1-3 or Isaiah 48:17, 18. If the opportunity allows, consider the remainder of the lesson. Offer to return to study the next lesson together.
6 About Our Literature: Knowing that all our literature is valuable and that publishing it costs money, do you ever hesitate to offer magazines, brochures, or books to the people you meet? How can we be sure that we are not giving literature away to unappreciative people? One way is to ask the person if he will promise to read the item that you are presenting.
7 When offering a “Family Happiness” book, for example, you might say this:
▪ “If you promise to read this book, I will leave it with you at no charge. [Allow for response.] You may wonder how we can afford to do this. It is because our work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to make a small donation toward our work, I will gladly accept it.” One brother was getting little response until he made two changes. First, he added a word, saying: “If you would like to make a small donation today toward our work, I will gladly accept it.” Next, he paused long enough to allow the householder to respond. He then felt more confident that the literature was appreciated and that it would be read.
8 Let us put forth every effort we can to share with others the secret that leads to family happiness​—following the instructions set forth in God’s Word.​—Ps. 19:7-10.

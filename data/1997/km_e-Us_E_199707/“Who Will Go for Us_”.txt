“Who Will Go for Us?”
When this question was raised by Jehovah, Isaiah immediately responded: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) Because the harvest is great today, the same call is being sounded now. More full-time workers​—regular pioneers—​are urgently needed! (Matt. 9:37) Are you willing to volunteer? If so, September 1, the beginning of the 1998 service year, would be a fine time to enroll as a pioneer. Why not ask the elders for an application?

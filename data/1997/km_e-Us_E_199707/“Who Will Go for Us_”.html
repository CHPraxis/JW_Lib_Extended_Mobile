<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When this question was raised by Jehovah, Isaiah immediately responded: “Here I am! Send me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8</a>) Because the harvest is great today, the same call is being sounded now. More full-time workers​—regular pioneers—​are urgently needed! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:37-40:9:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 9:37</a>) Are you willing to volunteer? If so, September 1, the beginning of the 1998 service year, would be a fine time to enroll as a pioneer. Why not ask the elders for an application?</p>

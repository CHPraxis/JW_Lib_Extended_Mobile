<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Keeping Jehovah’s Day Close in Mind” is the theme of the two-day circuit assembly program beginning in September. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:12-61:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:12</a>) It is designed to arouse our sense of urgency. Earth’s inhabitants will soon experience Jehovah’s judgments. Who will survive “the great day of God the Almighty”? Only those who remain spiritually awake and who establish a life pattern of “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Baptism is essential for a person to survive Jehovah’s day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:21</a>) Publishers who desire to be baptized at the assembly should tell the presiding overseer, who will make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A four-part symposium, “The Sort of Persons We Ought to Be,” will clearly show what actions are involved in keeping close in mind the presence of Jehovah’s day. The public talk, “Act Wisely as Jehovah’s Day Nears,” will explain what it means to ‘seek Jehovah, righteousness, and meekness,’ so as to be a survivor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The circuit assembly will conclude with two motivating talks by the traveling overseers, entitled: “Does Your Life Center Around the Truth?” and “Planning Ahead With Jehovah’s Day in Mind.” These discourses will move us to examine our life and make any needed adjustments. Bible prophecy and world events clearly indicate that Jehovah’s day is near. This assembly program will encourage us to ‘keep our senses and be watchful.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>) Make definite plans to attend both days.</p>

Help Others Find Comfort
1 Many people are tired of hearing about disasters, wars, crime, and suffering. Comfort, though conspicuously absent from today’s news reports, is something that mankind really needs. To comfort means “to give strength and hope to” and “to ease the grief or trouble of” another. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are equipped to help people in this way. (2 Cor. 1:3, 4) Our Bible-based brochures that we will be offering in July and August contain comforting messages of truth. (Rom. 15:4) Here are some suggestions for presenting them under various circumstances:
2 A tragic news story can create an opportunity to give a witness and bring comfort to others, perhaps by your saying something like this:
▪ “When such things happen, some wonder whether God really exists and, if he does, whether he cares about us. What do you think? [Allow for response.] One way to determine whether there is a God is to apply a well-established principle.” Read Hebrews 3:4. Point out other things around us that obviously required a maker. Then continue: “I have a brochure that I know you will find comforting. It is entitled Does God Really Care About Us? [Read the questions on the cover.] It contains convincing proof not only that God does exist but that he will soon bring an end to all the unjust conditions we face today. Would you like to read it?” Arrange to return.
3 On the return visit, you might say:
▪ “We were talking about the proof of God’s existence when I left the brochure Does God Really Care About Us? Perhaps you noticed this point on page 7. [Show the picture and summarize paragraph 15.] This is just one example showing that a caring God must really exist. [Read paragraph 27 on page 9.] A personal study of the Bible has helped me to cope with life’s everyday problems because it gives God’s view of matters.” Offer to demonstrate a study.
4 Telephone witnessing can be done using the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It?” You could introduce yourself and say:
▪ “I am calling you with an important message because I cannot come to see you personally.” Read the first paragraph on page 4 of the brochure, doing so naturally, as if you were conversing with the individual in person. Ask him what he thinks, and allow for a response. “I have my Bible open to Isaiah 45:18. This verse shows that the earth was created with us in mind. May I read it to you?” Afterward, explain the purpose of the brochure, and ask how you might deliver a copy.
5 On the follow-up call, you might try this approach to start a study:
▪ “I would like to build on our last conversation by illustrating who it is that can tell us the purpose of life. [Paraphrase paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 6 in the Purpose of Life brochure.] Revelation 4:11 explains that Jehovah God is our Creator. [Read.] He surely must have had a reason for creating us. People who have wanted to find out what it is have studied God’s written Word, the Bible. I would like to offer you that opportunity.” Explain how our free home Bible study course is conducted, and make arrangements to start the study.
6 This positive approach might comfort those who have experienced the death of a loved one:
▪ “I am doing a public service in behalf of all who have lost a loved one in death. Since this may be one of the hardest things any of us will ever have to cope with, this brochure, When Someone You Love Dies, has been prepared. It has helped millions of people. I would like to show you what it says about an exciting promise made by Jesus Christ. [Read the fifth paragraph on page 26, including John 5:21, 28, 29.] Notice this picture on page 29 depicting the Gospel account of Jesus actually raising Lazarus from the dead. If you would like to read this comforting brochure, I will be glad to leave it with you.”
7 When you return, you could again show the picture on page 29 of the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies” and say:
▪ “Recall our discussion about Christ’s resurrection of Lazarus. [Read the caption on page 28, and consider the material under the subheading “Did It Really Happen?”] If your heart yearns to believe that you could see a deceased loved one again, let me help you to make the resurrection hope your own.” Offer a home Bible study.
8 May we do our best in the months ahead to imitate Jesus by ‘comforting all the mourning ones.’​—Isa. 61:2.

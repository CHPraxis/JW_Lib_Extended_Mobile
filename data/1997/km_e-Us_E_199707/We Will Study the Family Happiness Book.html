<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">You will be glad to know that starting the week of October 6, 1997, we will consider the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>at the Congregation Book Study. No one will want to miss out on the group study of this practical Scriptural guide for a happy family life. The study schedule will allow for a thorough examination of every paragraph and Bible text in the book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The entire first chapter will be considered the first week of the study, since it contains few unquoted scriptures. For the same reason, chapter 15 will be considered in one session. However, all other chapters will be divided into two parts, with about half of a chapter being considered each week. Thus, there will be sufficient time to read and discuss all cited scriptures as well as to examine carefully the application of all quoted scriptures in each paragraph.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">An important feature of the study will be a discussion of the material in the teaching box at the conclusion of each chapter. Therefore, ample time should be allotted to consider the questions and the cited scriptures in the box.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Congregation Book Study conductors are urged to give special attention to their preparation for the study and to encourage all assigned to their group, including new ones, to prepare well, attend regularly, and participate.​—<em>om </em>74-6.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Khabarovsk, a city of some 700,000 in Russia’s Far East, has many congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Two women living in a village not far away obtained a copy of the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>The Witnesses in Khabarovsk, however, were unable to visit them in their village.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So the women, in the best way they knew how, began studying the book together, along with the Bible. After they finished, they decided that it was important to tell others about what they had learned, just as the early Christians did.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 10:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 20:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At the first door they called on, the women met a man with whom they began a Bible study. In time, both the man’s wife and his daughter joined in the regular Bible discussions. Later, after coming in contact with other Witnesses, all five of them were baptized. Now, the women who took the initiative to call on others are full-time evangelizers.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By reading the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, </em>you too may be moved to share Bible teachings with others. If you would like to receive a copy or would like to have someone call on you to conduct a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.</p>

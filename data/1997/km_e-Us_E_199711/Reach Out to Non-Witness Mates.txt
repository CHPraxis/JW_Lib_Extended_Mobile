Reach Out to Non-Witness Mates
1 It is a cause for great joy when married couples are united in true worship. However, in many families only one of the marriage mates has accepted the way of the truth. How can we reach out to these non-Witness mates and encourage them to worship Jehovah along with us?​—1 Tim. 2:1-4.
2 Understand Their Thinking: Although some non-Witness mates may be opposed, more often than not the problem is one of indifference or misunderstanding. A person may feel left out or be jealous over his or her mate’s newfound spiritual interest. “Alone in the house, I felt deserted,” one husband recalls. “I felt as if my wife and children were leaving me,” says another. Some men may think that they are losing their family to a religion. (See the August 15, 1990, Watchtower, pages 20-3.) That is why it is best, if possible, for the husband to be included with his wife in the home Bible study arrangement from the start.
3 Work as a Team: One Witness couple effectively worked together in aiding married people into the truth. After the sister had established a study with the wife, the brother would pay the husband a visit. He would often be able to start a study with the husband.
4 Be Friendly and Hospitable: Families in the congregation can help by taking an interest in families not yet united in true worship. A few friendly visits may help the non-Witness mate to see Jehovah’s Witnesses as warm, caring Christians who have everyone’s best interests at heart.
5 From time to time, the elders can review recent efforts that have been made to reach out to non-Witness mates and determine what more can be done in hopes of winning them to Jehovah.​—1 Pet. 3:1, ftn.

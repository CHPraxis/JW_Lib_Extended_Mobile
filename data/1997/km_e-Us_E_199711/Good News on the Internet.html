<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In our technological age, some people obtain information from electronic sources, including the Internet. So the Society has put on the Internet some accurate information about the beliefs and activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Our Internet Web site has the address <em>http://​www.watchtower.org </em>and contains a selection of tracts, brochures, and <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>articles in English, Chinese (Simplified), German, Russian, and Spanish, as well as in other languages. The publications on this Web site are already available through the congregations and are in use in the ministry. The purpose of our Web site is, not to release new publications, but to make information available to the public in electronic format. There is no need for any individual to prepare Internet pages about Jehovah’s Witnesses, our activities, or our beliefs. Our official site presents accurate information for any who want it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Although our site has no provision for electronic messages (E-mail), it lists postal addresses of branches around the globe. Thus people can write to obtain more information or to receive personal assistance from Witnesses locally. Feel free to share the above Internet address with any who might be inclined to begin learning Bible truth from this format.</p>

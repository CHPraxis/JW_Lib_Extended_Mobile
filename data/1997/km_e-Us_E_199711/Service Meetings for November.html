<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Good Manners at the Congregation Book Study. We appreciate the hospitality of families who open their home for a book study. This may involve considerable preparation and inconvenience. When attending, we should display good manners and show respect and consideration, which would include the following: (1) We should wipe our feet carefully before entering, to avoid soiling floors or carpets. (2) Parents should supervise their children, making sure that they are well behaved and stay in the area of the home designated for the book study. (3) While the group may be small and the atmosphere somewhat informal, this is a congregation meeting and we should dress as we do when going to the Kingdom Hall. (4) Association after the meeting should be kept brief so that the household can have private time for itself. (5) While the householder where the study is held might choose occasionally to serve a light refreshment after the study, all should understand that such is neither expected nor required.</p>

How can one meet the challenge of the return visit work? (2) Why do we put so much emphasis on starting Bible studies? How can we become skillful in conducting studies? (3) Why is it important to direct the students to the organization? How can we do this? Panel also relates how the recent <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>inserts of June 1996 and March and April 1997 have assisted them in these areas.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When we meet people in the ministry who respond favorably, we desire to return to give them a further witness. However, we may be unsure of what to say to spark the next conversation. You might try this approach: Raise an interesting question, and then turn to the <em>Reasoning </em>book to show the Scriptural answer. It would help to have a list of questions from which you could select the one that you feel might get the best response at a particular call. The list below, compiled from the <em>Reasoning </em>book, shows the page number where each answer is found:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Why do we grow old and die? (98)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Are there sound reasons for believing in God? (145)</p>

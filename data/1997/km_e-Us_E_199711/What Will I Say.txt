What Will I Say?
When we meet people in the ministry who respond favorably, we desire to return to give them a further witness. However, we may be unsure of what to say to spark the next conversation. You might try this approach: Raise an interesting question, and then turn to the Reasoning book to show the Scriptural answer. It would help to have a list of questions from which you could select the one that you feel might get the best response at a particular call. The list below, compiled from the Reasoning book, shows the page number where each answer is found:
▪ Why do we grow old and die? (98)
▪ Are there sound reasons for believing in God? (145)
▪ Does God really care what happens to us humans? (147)
▪ Must a person go to heaven to have a truly happy future? (163)
▪ Why is it important to know and use God’s personal name? (196)
▪ What will God’s Kingdom accomplish? (227)
▪ What is the purpose of human life? (243)
▪ Why are there so many religions? (322)
▪ How can a person know which religion is right? (328)
▪ How powerful a figure is Satan in today’s world? (364)
▪ Why does God permit suffering? (393)
▪ Why is there so much wickedness? (427)
You could put such a list of questions in your Bible or Reasoning book for quick reference. Having something definite in mind to say on return visits will encourage you to be faithful in following up all the interest you find.

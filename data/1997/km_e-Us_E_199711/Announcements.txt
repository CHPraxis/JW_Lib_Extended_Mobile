Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: Distribution of Kingdom News No. 35 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each home or dwelling with a copy of Kingdom News No. 35 may offer the Knowledge book. December: New World Translation with the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1985 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. February: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!
▪ After the special campaign is completed on November 16, congregations that still have a supply of Kingdom News No. 35 may encourage publishers to offer these in the same manner that tracts are used, whether from door to door or elsewhere. If advisable, publishers may leave one at each not-at-home, making sure that it cannot be seen by passersby. Efforts should be made to distribute all remaining copies of this important message.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1998 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their November literature request. The Yearbook will be available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Yearbooks are special-request items and will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists until shipments are made.
▪ New Audiocassettes Available:
Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life (five cassettes in an album)​—Spanish
▪ New Videocassettes Available:
Noah​—He Walked With God—​English

“A Great Service to Mankind”
“You have done a great service to mankind in publishing this book. It is a marvel. Excellent compilation. Deserving of appreciation.
“The beauty of the book is that it deals with every aspect of religion, and in doing so care was taken not to criticize. Well done. Really well done.”
To what book was the doctor from Tiruchchirappalli, India, who wrote this letter referring? Mankind’s Search for God, a 384-page compilation of the origins and teachings of the major religions of the world—Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The final chapters explain modern disbelief and a return to the true God. Over 16 million copies of this book have been printed in 37 languages.
The doctor had read a borrowed copy. He wanted one for himself. If you would like to examine this illustrated book for yourself, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the nearest address on page 5 of this magazine.

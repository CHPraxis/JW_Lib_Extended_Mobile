The “Seven Blunders of the World”
IT IS said that Mohandas Gandhi devised a list of what he termed the “Seven Blunders of the World.” They are as follows:
• Wealth without work
• Pleasure without conscience
• Knowledge without character
• Commerce without morality
• Science without humanity
• Worship without sacrifice
• Politics without principle
His grandson Arun Gandhi is said to have added an eighth:
• Rights without responsibilities
Maybe you could suggest a few more, but this list is certainly thought-provoking. The Bible’s answer to these “blunders” is condensed into two commandments: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”—Matthew 22:37-40.

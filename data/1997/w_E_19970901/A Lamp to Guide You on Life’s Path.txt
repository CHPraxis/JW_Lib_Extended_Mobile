A Lamp to Guide You on Life’s Path
“I WELL know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (Jeremiah 10:23) With these words the prophet Jeremiah showed that humans cannot successfully negotiate life’s path without help. Where can such help be found? The psalmist answers in his prayer to Jehovah God: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—Psalm 119:105.
Those who undertake a study of God’s Word, the Holy Bible, and apply what it says will be like someone who starts a journey early in the morning. At first, he cannot see much because it is dark. But as the sun begins to rise, he sees more and more. Finally, the sun shines directly overhead. He sees everything in clear detail. Such an illustration calls to mind a Bible proverb: “The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.”—Proverbs 4:18.
What about those who reject God’s guidance? The Bible says: “The way of the wicked ones is like the gloom; they have not known at what they keep stumbling.” (Proverbs 4:19) Yes, the wicked are like the man who stumbles in the dark. Even their seeming successes are at best temporary, for “there is no wisdom, nor any discernment, nor any counsel in opposition to Jehovah.”—Proverbs 21:30.
Therefore, follow the guidance of God’s Word, the Bible. If you do, you will find the words of Proverbs 3:5, 6 to be true: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”

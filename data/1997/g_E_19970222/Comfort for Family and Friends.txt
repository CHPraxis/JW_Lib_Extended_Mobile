Comfort for Family and Friends
WHEN TWA flight 800 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean last July 17, all 230 persons aboard perished. These included 16 high school French students and five adult chaperones from Montoursville, a small Pennsylvania town of about 5,000. At a town memorial service on August 17, one of the speakers, Rudolph Giuliani, mayor of New York City, noted that if the same percentage of the population of New York City had died, 35,000 lives would have been snuffed out!
The high school principal, Dan Chandler, was asked to speak at the funerals of several students. He quoted the Bible promise at Revelation 21:4, which says that in God’s new system of things “death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.” As to why such tragedies occur, he pointed to Ecclesiastes 9:11, which speaks of “time and unforeseen occurrence” befalling all of us. Many were surprised to hear their high school principal offer such comforting comments.
To offer further help, Chandler set up a table at the high school to make available such publications as the 32-page brochure When Someone You Love Dies and the tract What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? Hundreds of pieces of Bible literature were accepted, and many expressed thanks for the comfort these provided.
You too may find needed comfort from the above-mentioned brochure and tract. If you would like to receive a copy of each or would like to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.

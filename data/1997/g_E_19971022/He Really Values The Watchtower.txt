He Really Values The Watchtower
“Although I am a Roman Catholic,” wrote a sixth-grade student from Toledo, Ohio, U.S.A., “I would like a subscription to your fine magazine. What got me into The Watchtower was Trevor. He sits next to me in class. We have been friends for about a year now, and he has taught me many things about Jesus, Jehovah, and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Trevor is my age, my height, and is very dedicated to his religion. He has a subscription to The Watchtower and let me borrow one of his magazines. I liked the sensible articles that you write. I hope you will overlook the fact that I am not a Jehovah’s Witness and let me get a subscription to your magazine.”
The Watchtower and its companion magazine, Awake!, are read with enjoyment by people of many nationalities and religions around the world. Last year alone more than 900 million copies of these two magazines were printed in over 120 languages!

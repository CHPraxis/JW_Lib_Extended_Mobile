<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Although I am a Roman Catholic,” wrote a sixth-grade student from Toledo, Ohio, U.S.A., “I would like a subscription to your fine magazine. What got me into <em>The Watchtower </em>was Trevor. He sits next to me in class. We have been friends for about a year now, and he has taught me many things about Jesus, Jehovah, and Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Trevor is my age, my height, and is very dedicated to his religion. He has a subscription to <em>The Watchtower </em>and let me borrow one of his magazines. I liked the sensible articles that you write. I hope you will overlook the fact that I am not a Jehovah’s Witness and let me get a subscription to your magazine.”</p>

Bearing the Yoke in Youth
IN THESE “critical times hard to deal with,” young people face heavy pressures. (2 Timothy 3:1) They are daily barraged with propaganda encouraging immorality, smoking, and other forms of destructive behavior. Those who follow Bible standards may be ridiculed for refusing to go along with the crowd, and some Christians may feel that it would be easier to give in.
Toward the end of the seventh century B.C.E., Jeremiah wrote: “Good it is for an able-bodied man that he should carry the yoke during his youth.” (Lamentations 3:27) What did he mean? That learning to cope with trials while young helps prepare one to meet the challenges of adulthood. Adversities, though unpleasant, are inevitable for both Christian youths and adults. (2 Timothy 3:12) But the benefits of faithfulness far outweigh any temporary relief that compromise might bring.
If you are a youth, face up to tests of faith squarely. When tempted to engage in wrong conduct, refuse to compromise. Though at the moment it may be difficult to do this, in the long run, you will have fewer anxieties. Jesus promised: “Take my yoke upon you . . . , and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.”—Matthew 11:29, 30.
Accept the challenge of living by Bible principles. Doing so will give you the best way of life now and a sure hope for the future. As the Bible states, “the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—1 John 2:17.

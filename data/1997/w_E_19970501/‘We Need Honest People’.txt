‘We Need Honest People’
HONESTY is rare in today’s world. Yet, it is a basic requirement for Christians. Paul wrote: “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18) This is what Wilma, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Faenza, Italy, wanted to do.
The newspaper Il Resto del Carlino relates that when she found a wallet containing a large sum of money outside a supermarket in her city, she turned it over to the police “without hesitation” so that it could be returned to its owner.
When the mayor heard of this, he immediately sent a brief note of thanks to Wilma. “In the name of the City,” he wrote, “I heartily thank you for your fine gesture. Our noble city of Faenza needs good and honest people.”
Whether good actions become known or not, we should always strive to be honest. As the Holy Scriptures exhort, “we are trying to do right not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of men.”—2 Corinthians 8:21, The Jerusalem Bible.

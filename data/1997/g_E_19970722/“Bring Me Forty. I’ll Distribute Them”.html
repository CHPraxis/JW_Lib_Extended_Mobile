<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As part of their Bible education work in southern Germany, Wolfgang and his wife, Waltraut, on several occasions offered a man copies of <em>Awake! </em>He would always decline, saying: “I’ve already got so much to read.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, the couple sensed that the man might read the article “Removing Misconceptions About Jehovah’s Witnesses,” in the November 22, 1996, issue of <em>Awake! </em>The article was about a talk given at a Rotary Club in California in the United States.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Wolfgang opened the magazine to that article and showed it to the man, the man started to read it. He then asked if he could keep it. “I’ll read it tonight when I get some peace and quiet,” he said.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Wolfgang and his wife met the man three days later. What was his reaction? “The article was very interesting,” he said.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why was he so impressed? It seems that he had also had some misconceptions about Jehovah’s Witnesses. He now felt sure that his friends at the Rotary Club would enjoy reading the article. “Can you get hold of more copies of the article?” he asked.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“How many do you want?” asked Waltraut.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Bring me forty. I’ll distribute them.”</p>

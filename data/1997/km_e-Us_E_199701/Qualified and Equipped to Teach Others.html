<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When Moses was appointed as Jehovah’s representative, he did not feel qualified to declare God’s word to Pharaoh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:10-2:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:12-2:6:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6:12</a>) Jeremiah revealed his lack of confidence in being able to serve as Jehovah’s prophet, telling God that he did not know how to speak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:6-24:1:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 1:6</a>) Despite their initial lack of confidence, both of those prophets proved to be fearless witnesses for Jehovah. They were adequately qualified by God.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Today, thanks to Jehovah, we have what we need to accomplish our ministry with confidence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:4-47:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:17-55:3:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:17</a>) Like a qualified mechanic with a full set of tools, we are properly equipped to accomplish our assigned ministry skillfully. In January we are offering any 192-page book that was published prior to 1984 and that the congregation may have on hand. Although these spiritual tools are not new, their Scriptural themes are still current and these books will help people to learn the truth. The following suggested presentations may be adapted to whichever book is being offered.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>The subject of education may be used to create interest in God’s Word. You could initiate a conversation by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“There is much emphasis today on the need for quality education. In your opinion, what kind of education should a person pursue to ensure the greatest happiness and success in life? [Allow for response.] Eternal benefits can be gained by those who take in knowledge of God. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:10, 11</a>.] This handbook [give title of the book you are offering] is based on the Bible. It points to the only source of knowledge that can lead to everlasting life.” Show a specific example in the book. If there is genuine interest, leave the book and arrange for a return visit. State that although the publication is left without charge, we will accept a small donation toward our worldwide ministry.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When returning to a householder with whom you discussed the importance of Bible education, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“On my last visit, we discussed the Bible as being the source of education that can ensure our eternal future. Of course, it takes effort to learn what we need to know from the Scriptures. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>.] Many people find it difficult to understand some portions of the Bible. I would like to demonstrate briefly a method we have used extensively to help people learn more about basic Bible teachings.” Using the book that was left, turn to an appropriate place and briefly demonstrate a Bible study. If the householder desires to have a regular study, explain that you will return with our study aid <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Many people are troubled by the suffering of millions of the world’s children. Perhaps you can help the householder to see how God views this plight, by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“No doubt you have seen news reports about children around the globe who are hungry, sick, and neglected. Why have concerned organizations not been able to improve the situation? [Allow for response.] God wants only what is best for humans. Note what he promises for children and adults, as recorded in the Bible. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.] This book [mention the title] provides more details about a world of God’s making where suffering will cease.” If possible, open to an illustration that depicts Paradise, and discuss it. Offer the book, and arrange for another visit. Gladly accept any donation the individual is willing to make toward our work.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>If you spoke initially about the suffering of children, on the next visit you might continue the discussion by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“When I was here recently, you expressed concern about the plight of children who suffer because of broken homes, famine, sickness, and violence. It is comforting to read in the Bible about a world where neither children nor adults will suffer sickness, pain, or death. A prophecy in the book of Isaiah describes a better life to come on earth.” Read and discuss <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:20-23:65:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:20-25</a>. Lead up to an eventual Bible study in the <em>Knowledge </em>book.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>Since the practice of prayer is common for religious people, you could start a conversation on this topic by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“At some point in our life, most of us have experienced problems that have moved us to pray to God for help. And yet, many feel that their prayers are not answered. It even appears that religious leaders who pray publicly for peace are not being heard. We say that because war and violence continue to distress mankind. Does God really listen to prayers? If he does, why do so many prayers seem to go unanswered? [Allow for response.] <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:18-19:145:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 145:18</a> explains what is required if our prayers are to be answered. [Read scripture.] For one thing, prayers to God must be sincere and in accord with the truth found in his Word, the Bible.” Show the book you are offering, and point out what it says about the value of prayer.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong><em>When following up a previous discussion about prayer, you might try this approach:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I enjoyed our conversation on the subject of prayer. You will no doubt find Jesus’ thoughts about what to pray for to be a helpful guide.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>, pointing out the chief concerns featured by Jesus in his model prayer. Show chapter 16, “How You Can Draw Close to God,” in the <em>Knowledge </em>book, and ask if you can demonstrate how to study the material.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>When it comes to imparting the knowledge of God to others, we may ask, “Who is adequately qualified for these things?” The Scriptures answer: “We are.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:16-47:2:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:16, 17</a>.</p>

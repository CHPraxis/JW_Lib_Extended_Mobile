<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Local announcements. Selected Announcements from <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Comment on October field service report for the country and for the local congregation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Time to Renew the Advance Medical Directive/​Release Card. Qualified elder discusses importance of filling out card completely and carrying it at all times. This document speaks for you if you are unable to speak for yourself in an emergency. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.) A new card needs to be filled out every year to give a current declaration on refusal of blood, since some doctors and others have claimed that documents older than one year may not reflect a person’s current conviction. After the meeting, all baptized publishers will be given the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card, and those with unbaptized minor children will receive an Identity Card for each child. Explain that these cards are not to be filled out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home but NOT signed. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done following the next Congregation Book Study, under the supervision of the book study conductor. He will check to see that all assigned to his group received a card and have needed assistance. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. Anyone missing at that time will be assisted by conductors/​elders at the next Service Meeting until all baptized publishers have their cards properly filled out and signed. (Review letter of October 15, 1991.) By adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive to use for themselves and their children. Refer to Question Box of the December 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Explain that the health-care power of attorney (proxy) form provided by the Society is a legal document recognized by medical and legal personnel and that when it is properly filled out, it offers additional legal assurance that one’s wishes will be respected on blood and other health-care and end-of-life decisions. Baptized publishers may obtain a copy of this document from the secretary. (Unlike the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card, which is renewed annually, the health-care power of attorney (proxy) form needs to be replaced only when you elect to make a change in it.) Exercising insight in caring for these vital details will merit good from Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:20-20:16:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 16:20</a>.</p>

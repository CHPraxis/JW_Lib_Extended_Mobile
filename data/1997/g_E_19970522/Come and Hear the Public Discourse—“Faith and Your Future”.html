<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Can your future really be known? Is there something you can do to determine what it will be?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The public discourse, a feature of the “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, will show why there is genuine hope for a bright future. You may listen to the talk at a location near your home, since beginning this month it will be delivered at hundreds of conventions throughout the world.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally or write to the publishers of this magazine for the location of the convention nearest you. The June 8 issue of <em>Awake! </em>will also list the addresses of all convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.</p>

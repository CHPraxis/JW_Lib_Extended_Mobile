Come and Hear the Public Discourse—“Faith and Your Future”
Can your future really be known? Is there something you can do to determine what it will be?
The public discourse, a feature of the “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, will show why there is genuine hope for a bright future. You may listen to the talk at a location near your home, since beginning this month it will be delivered at hundreds of conventions throughout the world.
Contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally or write to the publishers of this magazine for the location of the convention nearest you. The June 8 issue of Awake! will also list the addresses of all convention locations in the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.

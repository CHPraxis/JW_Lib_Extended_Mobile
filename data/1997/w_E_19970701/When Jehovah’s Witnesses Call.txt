When Jehovah’s Witnesses Call
What should Catholics do when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses calls at their home? A recent publication prepared by the National Catechistic Bureau of the Italian Bishops’ Conference states: “Refusing a conversation, kindly but nonetheless firmly, is not in this case a lack of charity.”
Not all Catholics agree, as shown by a letter sent to the daily Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno by a man living in Foggia, Italy:
“I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I am a Catholic. But I am amazed by certain rules the church imposes upon the faithful, telling them to stick notices on their doors sending Jehovah’s Witnesses away. These people, after all, are simply carrying God’s Word, and they help others to have a deeper knowledge of the Bible. I am reminded of the time when Italy was struck by cholera and we were given advice on how to avoid infection.
“In my opinion, this shows that the church dictates her own rules without taking into consideration the wishes of the faithful. But for some years now, I have seen that even Catholics are going from house to house, visiting homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses too; and they let them in, conversing with them, without rejecting anybody.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses do not force people to accept their message. Rather, they endeavor to share with others the hope held out in God’s Word that they themselves have found to be comforting in these troubled times. By going from house to house, as well as by speaking with those whom they meet on the street, Jehovah’s Witnesses share the good news of God’s Kingdom with those who are willing to listen.—Matthew 24:14; Acts 5:42; 17:17.

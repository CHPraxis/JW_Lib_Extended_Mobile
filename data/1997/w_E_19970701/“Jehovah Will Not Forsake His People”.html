<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">1, 2. (a) How is Jehovah blessing his people today? (b) What are many Christians faced with, and what questions arise?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">IN FULFILLMENT of Bible prophecy, Jehovah’s worshipers dwell in a spiritual paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:1-47:12:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses belong to an international fellowship characterized by love and unity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) They enjoy a deep and comprehensive knowledge of Bible truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:13-23:54:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:13</a>) How grateful they are to Jehovah that he is granting them the privilege of being guests in his spiritual tent!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>While all in Jehovah’s organization enjoy spiritual prosperity, some seem to live in relative peace and tranquillity while others experience afflictions of one sort or another. Many Christians find themselves in a pitiable position for long periods of time and with no relief in sight. Discouragement is natural under such circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:12-20:13:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:12</a>) Are calamities evidence of God’s displeasure? Is Jehovah providing special protection to some Christians while forsaking others?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 3. (a) Is Jehovah responsible for the adversities experienced by his people? (b) Why do even faithful worshipers of Jehovah experience human suffering?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The Bible answers: “When under trial, let no one say: ‘I am being tried by God.’ For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>) Jehovah is the Protector and Sustainer of his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:2-19:91:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 91:2-6</a>) “Jehovah will not forsake his people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:14-19:94:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 94:14</a>) This does not mean that faithful worshipers will not experience suffering. The present world system of things is governed by individuals who are inherently imperfect. Many are corrupt, and a few are outright evil. None of them look to Jehovah for wisdom. This results in much human suffering. The Bible makes clear that Jehovah’s people cannot always avoid the sad consequences of human imperfection and wickedness.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:22-44:14:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 14:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Loyal Christians Expect to Suffer</strong></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 4. What can all Christians expect as long as they live in this wicked system of things, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Although not part of the world, Jesus’ followers live in the midst of this system of things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:15-43:17:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 17:15, 16</a>) Satan is exposed in the Bible as the dominating force behind this world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Hence, all Christians can expect sooner or later to have to face serious problems. With that in mind, the apostle Peter says: “Keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>against him, solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of your brothers in the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8, 9</a>) Yes, the entire association of Christians can expect sufferings.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5. How did Jesus make it clear that faithful Christians will experience sad things in life?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Even if we deeply love Jehovah and are loyal to his principles, we will experience sad things in life. Jesus made this clear in his illustration recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, where he drew a contrast between those who obey his words and those who do not. He compared obedient disciples to a discreet man who builds a house upon a solid rock-mass. Those who do not obey his words he likened to a foolish man who builds his house upon the sand. After a severe storm, only the house built on the rock-mass survives. Note that in the case of the discreet man’s house, “the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in.” Jesus did not promise that the discreet man would always enjoy peace and tranquillity. Rather, that man’s discretion would prepare him to weather the storm. A similar thought is conveyed in the illustration of the sower. In it Jesus explains that even obedient worshipers “with a fine and good heart” would “bear fruit with endurance.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:4-42:8:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 8:4-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. In Paul’s illustration of the fire-resistant materials, who undergo the fiery test?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In writing to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul used metaphoric language to illustrate the need for durable qualities that can help us face trials. Such fire-resistant materials as gold, silver, and precious stones correspond to godly qualities. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:13-20:3:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:6, 7</a>.) On the other hand, fleshly traits are likened to combustible materials. Then Paul says: “Each one’s work will become manifest, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire; and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one’s is. If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:10-46:3:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:10-14</a>) Here again, the Bible explains that <em>all of us </em>will inevitably face some form of fiery test.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>, how can the Scriptures help us endure trials?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>There are numerous accounts in the Bible of loyal servants of God who had to endure calamities, sometimes for long periods. Yet, Jehovah did not forsake them. The apostle Paul likely had such examples in mind when he said: “All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) Consider the examples of three men who, while enjoying a close relationship with God, suffered many calamities.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>What We Learn From Bible Accounts</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. What did Jehovah allow in the case of Joseph, and for how long?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jacob’s son Joseph was favored by Jehovah from a young age. Still, through no fault of his own, he suffered a series of calamities. He was kidnapped and treated cruelly by his own brothers. He was sold as a slave in a strange land where he was lyingly accused and placed in a “prison hole.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:15-1:40:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 40:15</a>) There, “with fetters they afflicted his feet, into irons his soul came.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:17-19:105:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 105:17, 18</a>) During his slavery and imprisonment, Joseph no <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>doubt repeatedly begged Jehovah for a release. Yet, for some <em>13 years, </em>although strengthened by Jehovah in various ways, he woke up every morning still a slave or a prisoner.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:37:2-1:37:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 37:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:46-1:41:46" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 41:46</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 9. What did David have to endure for several years?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>A similar case is that of David. When Jehovah was selecting a qualified man to rule Israel, he said: “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man agreeable to my <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:22-44:13:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 13:22</a>) Despite his favored position in Jehovah’s eyes, David suffered much. In mortal danger, he hid for several years in the wilderness, in caves, in crevices, and on foreign ground. Hunted like a wild beast, he suffered discouragement and fear. Nevertheless, he endured in Jehovah’s strength. David could rightly say from his own experience: “Many are the calamities of the righteous one, but out of them all Jehovah delivers him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:19-19:34:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 34:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10. What extreme calamity befell Naboth and his family?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In the prophet Elijah’s day, there were only 7,000 in Israel who had not bowed the knee to the false god Baal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:18-11:19:18" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Kings 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:4-45:11:4" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Romans 11:4</a>) Naboth, who was likely one of them, became the victim of a terrible injustice. He suffered the humiliation of being accused of blasphemy. Found guilty, he was convicted and sentenced by royal decree to die by stoning, and his blood was licked up by dogs. Even his sons were put to death! Yet, he was innocent of the charge. The witnesses against him were liars. The whole affair was a plot hatched by Queen Jezebel so that the king could get his hands on Naboth’s vineyard.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:1-11:21:19" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Kings 21:1-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:26-12:9:26" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 9:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11. What does the apostle Paul tell us about faithful men and women in Bible history?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Joseph, David, and Naboth are but three of the many faithful men and women mentioned in the Bible who suffered calamities. The apostle Paul wrote a historical review of Jehovah’s servants through the ages. In it he spoke of those who “received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by bonds and prisons. They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn asunder, they died by slaughter with the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while they were in want, in tribulation, under ill-treatment; and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves and dens of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:36-58:11:38" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>) But Jehovah did not forsake them.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12. What are some of the afflictions experienced by Jehovah’s Witnesses today?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>What about Jehovah’s people today? As an organization, we can count on divine protection and safe passage through the last days and the great tribulation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:9-17</a>) However, as individuals, we recognize that “time and unforeseen occurrence” befall all humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>) Today there are many faithful Christians who are suffering calamities. Some endure extreme poverty. The Bible speaks of Christian “orphans and widows” who have tribulation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">James 1:27</a>) Others suffer as a result of natural disasters, wars, crime, abuse of power, sickness, and death.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">13. What difficult experiences have recently been reported?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>For example, in their 1996 reports to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Watch Tower branch offices related that some of our brothers and sisters are suffering imprisonment in deplorable conditions because of their adherence to Bible principles. Three congregations in a South American country were dissolved when guerrilla groups forced hundreds of Witnesses to evacuate the area. In a West African country, some Witnesses caught in a civil-war skirmish were killed. In a Central American country, the already critical <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>financial situation of some brothers was worsened by the onslaught of a hurricane. In other places where poverty and food shortages may not be serious problems, negative influences may dampen the joy of some. Others are weighed down by the pressures of modern-day living. Because of the public’s apathy, still others may feel discouraged when they preach the good news of the Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14. (a) What do we learn from Job’s example? (b) Instead of thinking negatively, what should we do when we are experiencing distress?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>These situations are not to be construed as evidence of God’s displeasure. Remember the case of Job and the many adversities he suffered. He was “a man blameless and upright.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) How disheartened Job must have felt when Eliphaz charged him with wrongdoing! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:1-18:4:21" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job, chapters 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:5:1-18:5:27" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:1-18:22:30" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 22</a>) We do not want to be quick to conclude that we experience calamities because we have failed Jehovah in some way or because Jehovah has withdrawn his blessing. Negative thinking in the face of tribulation could weaken our faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:1-52:3:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 3:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:5-52:3:5" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 5</a>) When experiencing distress, it is best to meditate on the fact that Jehovah and Jesus are close to the righteous regardless of what happens.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">15. How do we know that Jehovah is deeply concerned about the calamities suffered by his people?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>The apostle Paul reassures us when he says: “Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword? . . . I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:35-45:8:35" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 8:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 38, 39</a>) Jehovah is deeply concerned about us and is aware of our suffering.

Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:15-19:34:15" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 34:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:6-40:18:6" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> Matthew 18:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:14-40:18:14" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 14</a>) Our heavenly Father cares for us and feels pity for those who suffer.

Therefore, may we resolve not to “give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:9-48:6:9" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Galatians 6:9</a>.</p>

All His Questions Answered
A man contacted in India by Jehovah’s Witnesses found that what they were teaching was quite different from what he had been taught in church. He spoke with Jehovah’s Witnesses about this and even wrote to their branch office in India to ask questions.
Then, one day the man wrote a letter that began: “My dearest brothers at Lonavla”—the location of the branch office of the Witnesses in India. He explained: “All my doubts and questions were automatically answered in the May 8, 1995, Awake! magazine under the topic ‘Have You Ever Wondered?’ I am totally convinced that Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth.”
That article in Awake! had answered such questions as the following: “Would true worship try to hide or replace God’s revealed name?” “What kind of conduct should the true religion produce as a result of its teachings?” “Would the worship approved by God permit participation in wars and racial or tribal killings?”
We are confident that Awake! can also help you in your quest for Bible truth.

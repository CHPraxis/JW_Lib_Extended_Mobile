<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT do your children see? War? Crime? Pollution? Poverty? Sickness? True, these are ever-present realities. But have you taught them to look beyond these things to the wonderful future promised in the Bible? The parents of nine-year-old Joel Pierson have done this. With what result?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Consider what Joel wrote on the subject “Just Open Your Eyes and See.” This topic was given as a writing assignment for youths in a school district in Virginia, U.S.A. Note how Joel’s essay, published in the newspaper <em>The Central Virginian</em>, August 22, 1996, reveals that his hope is based on what he has learned from God’s Word. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Just open your eyes and see, all the beauty that was meant to be.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Wouldn’t it be wonderful to wake up one morning and hear that there was no more pollution? Instead of killing and crime being on the news, peace and happiness are what is in people’s lives.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Neighbors are working together to help a friend build his home. Close by, we see others planting a garden. It’s not just this, but their motives are pure. Everyone is joining together to help one another. There will be no more poor people, and there will be plenty of food to go around. There will be unity and peace around the world. No one will ever go hungry or sick again. There are lovely surroundings for all to look at and look, a child is riding a tiger! It’s not just the tiger but all the animals are at peace with humans.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“I would like to live in a place like this. Would you like to live there with me?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Does God really promise blessings such as young Joel here describes? Indeed, he does! Please open your Bible and read about such promises as those found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:8-19:46:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:67:6-19:67:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 67:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 72:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:3-23:2:4" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Isaiah 2:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 11:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:25" data-bid="1-7" class="b"> 65:17-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-8" class="b"> Matthew 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="1-9" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="1-10" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“GO, EAT your food with rejoicing,” says the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:7-21:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>. Eating, indeed, is not only a necessity but also one of the greatest pleasures in life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Consider 34-year-old Thomas. He enjoys his meat. And he has it every day—often several times a day. His typical breakfast includes milk, several eggs, bread or toast smothered with butter, and sausage or bacon. At fast-food places, he orders cheeseburgers, French fries, and milk shakes. When dining out, he chooses beefsteak as an entrée. His favorite restaurant serves a 24-ounce <strong>[680 g] </strong>steak and a baked potato heaped with sour cream, just the way he likes it. Chocolate cake topped with chocolate ice cream is his favorite dessert.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thomas is five feet ten inches <strong>[178 cm] </strong>tall and weighs 196 pounds <strong>[89 kg]</strong>; he is 20 pounds <strong>[9 kg] </strong>overweight, according to the 1995 U.S. government dietary guidelines. “I am not uncomfortable with my weight,” says Thomas. “My health is excellent. I haven’t missed a day of work in the last 12 years. Most of the time, I feel good and energetic—except, of course, after eating a 24-ounce <strong>[680 g] </strong>steak.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Could Thomas’s diet, though, be affecting him for the worse, slowly making him a candidate for a heart attack? In his book <em>How We Die, </em>Dr. Sherwin Nuland speaks of ‘patterns of living that are suicidal’ and includes in them a diet of ‘red meat, great slabs of bacon, and butter.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How do certain foods lead to heart disease in many? What is in them that causes danger? Before discussing these questions, let us take a closer look at the health risks of being overweight.</p>

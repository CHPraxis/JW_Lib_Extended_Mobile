It Moved Him to Action!
A man from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, visited his aged father, Rufino. The father lived in La Loma, a remote village in the country. The son took Rufino the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.
Later, Jehovah’s Witnesses from Los Humocaros went to preach in La Loma. To their surprise, people kept saying that a Witness was already visiting them. The Witnesses were puzzled because they knew that there were no Witnesses living in the area. Then someone pointed out the house of the alleged Witness—it was Rufino’s house!
Rufino was delighted to meet his visitors. Why had those in his village identified him as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Well, Rufino had begun reading the Live Forever book, and when he came to chapter 13, he saw the illustration of Jesus sending his followers out in the preaching work. Rufino reached the conclusion that Christians today should be doing the same work. So he began sharing with his neighbors the Bible truths that he had been learning.
A regular Bible study was started with Rufino, and he was told about congregation meetings. The following Sunday he was at the Kingdom Hall. Even though Rufino was 80 years old, he had walked three hours to be there! From that day on, he never missed a meeting unless he was very ill. He even enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School and gave a fine talk. Rufino became sick last year, and he died in July 1996, with the firm hope of a resurrection to a paradise earth.

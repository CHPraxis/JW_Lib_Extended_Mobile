Teach Others What God Requires
1 Many people can still be found who have been spiritually deprived of “hearing the words of Jehovah.” (Amos 8:11) While some believe that God exists, they are unaware of his purpose and requirements. Thus, there is a need for us to teach them lifesaving Kingdom truth. By being properly equipped and prepared to witness at every opportunity, we can reach those who want to learn what Jehovah requires.
2 During April and May, we will have very timely issues of The Watchtower and Awake! to distribute. Additionally, for the first time, we will feature the brochure What Does God Require of Us? Its eye-catching illustrations and thought-provoking questions give this brochure wide appeal. The following suggestions are offered to help us use our excellent publications to good advantage.
3 Searching Out People: In areas where many people are not at home when we call from house to house, it is proving beneficial to search out and talk to people wherever they are found. The September 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry insert encouraged us to preach the good news everywhere​—on the street, on public transportation, and in parks, parking lots, and business places. It also made us conscious of the need to create opportunities to preach informally. As an example of this, a pioneer sister went to the zoo and took with her a supply of the August 8, 1996, Awake! with the series “Endangered Species​—Why Be Concerned?” Within an hour, she placed 40 copies with some very appreciative animal lovers! What success have you enjoyed thus far preaching the good news everywhere? The Watchtower and Awake! as well as the Require brochure are especially suited for all kinds of witnessing because they feature information that touches people’s lives and stimulates thinking ability.
4 Starting Conversations: The back page of the October 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry gives details on how to prepare your own presentation for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. The same suggestions will work well when preparing your presentation for the Require brochure. What we say can be as brief as a few sentences or long enough to include a Scriptural thought. It is important to select the opening words carefully, since they may determine whether the person you approach will continue to listen. Some have been successful with this opening comment: “I read an article that was encouraging to me, and I want to share it with you.” Or an interesting question can be raised to draw the other party into a conversation.
5 If appropriate in your area, you might try asking questions like the following in your presentations this month:
▪ “Today we see so much graffiti, litter, and pollution. What will it take to clean up the earth and make it a better place in which to live?” Allow for a response, and then explain that you have information that assures us of how and when the earth will become a global garden. Share a specific comment, a brief scripture, and a colorful illustration from a current magazine, and then offer it to the individual for him to read. Mention that many who enjoy reading our publications offer a donation, which we gladly put toward our worldwide work. Before you end the conversation, try to arrange to continue it at another time.
▪ “Do you think that God meant for us to live surrounded by troubles such as those we are faced with today?” After the person answers, you could say: “Likely you are familiar with the prayer Jesus taught his followers to pray, asking for God’s Kingdom to come. Have you given thought to just what the Kingdom of God really is?” Turn to lesson 6 in the Require brochure, and read the questions that are posed at the beginning of the lesson. Then, as you read paragraph 1, point out the answer to the first question. Explain that the rest of the questions are answered just as concisely. Offer the brochure, mention the arrangement for donations, and offer to meet again to share more information about the Kingdom.
▪ “Many thinking people are beginning to view the religions of the world as the cause of man’s problems rather than being the solution. What do you think about that?” After listening to the person’s viewpoint, show something from one of the current magazines that may capture his interest about false religion’s failure or its approaching downfall. Ask if he would like to read it. Exchange names, and offer to make contact again so that you can explain how it is that true religion has not failed mankind. Wherever appropriate, explain how the interested person may make a small donation.
▪ “With so many problems in family life today, have you ever wondered what is the secret for obtaining family happiness?” Wait for a response, and explain that in the Bible, God reveals the real secret of family happiness. Perhaps you could read Isaiah 48:17. Then turn to lesson 8 in the Require brochure, and point to some of the cited Bible verses that provide reliable guidance for each member of the family. Read the list of questions at the beginning of the lesson. Ask if the person would like to read the answers. If so, give him the brochure and explain that although there is no charge for it, we do accept modest donations to support our worldwide work. Offer to return another time to share more of the practical guidance that the Bible contains for happy family life.
6 The insert in the March 1997 Our Kingdom Ministry encouraged us to muster up boldness to make return visits. It recommended using the Require brochure to start Bible studies, if not on the initial call, then on the return visit. Mankind’s greatest need is to learn what God requires and then to do it. (Col. 1:9, 10) We will greatly benefit others during April and May if we can begin to teach them what we know about Jehovah’s requirements for life.​—1 Cor. 9:23.

(See <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:201995330/1-56$p/E:201995332/">September 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>pages 3-5</a>.) Reports show that congregations often order many more magazines than they actually distribute each month. Up to 50 percent are never reported as placements. (Show what the statistics indicate locally.) What happens to these magazines? Many end up on a shelf or are thrown away. How can this be avoided? Each publisher should carefully estimate his needs and order only what he can place. Make it a practice to offer magazines to all we contact. Do not let older issues go to waste. Share in magazine service regularly. Bear in mind that we need to mention the donation arrangement and to turn in all donations promptly.</p>

Announce the names of those who will auxiliary pioneer in May. Outline the additional arrangements that are being made locally for meetings for service. During May a special effort should be made to follow up brochure placements with the goal of starting studies. Briefly suggest ways we can tactfully request the name and address of people we witness to informally. You could give your name and address first and ask if there is a phone number where they can be reached. Invite audience to offer other suggestions that have worked for them.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201997127/">Why Do They Do It?</a>” An elder discusses article with two or three regular pioneers. (If not available, use ones who enroll often as auxiliary pioneers.) Include highlights from article “Pioneers Bestow and Receive Blessings,” in the January 15, 1994, <em>Watchtower. </em>Have each one explain why he or she has taken up the pioneer service. Ask them to relate experiences showing how they have been blessed for doing so.</p>

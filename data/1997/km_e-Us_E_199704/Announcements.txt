Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: Individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! on Saturdays and the brochure What Does God Require of Us? at other times during the week. June: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Concentrate on starting home Bible studies. July and August: Any of the following 32-page brochures: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It?, and When Someone You Love Dies.
▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.
▪ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made each month before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.
▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 1997 in Chinese, English, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregations, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). It is necessary to request plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation who desire them.
▪ An English translation of the brochure Lasting Peace and Happiness​—How to Find Them has been produced in addition to the Chinese and Simplified Chinese editions. Since this brochure is designed for use only in studying with Chinese people, it will not be widely distributed in the English-language field.
▪ A packet of legal materials is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters where our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in such a case if it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. Helpful information can be found for those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14, and the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.

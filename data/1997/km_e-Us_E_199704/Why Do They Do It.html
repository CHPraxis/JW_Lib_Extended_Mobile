<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It was foretold about the Christ that ‘sheer zeal for God’s house would eat him up.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:9-19:69:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 69:9</a>) Jesus’ zeal for the true worship of Jehovah impelled him to put the ministry first. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 4:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> John 18:37</a>) This same zeal to bear witness to the truth is reflected today in the ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Last service year, an average of 645,509 worldwide shared in some form of pioneer service each month. In view of our dedication to God, each of us should prayerfully consider whether we can arrange our circumstances in order to serve as an auxiliary or a regular pioneer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Eccl. 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Living in a system of things that is selfishly materialistic, many in the world find it hard to understand why anyone would work so hard in the ministry for something that brings no monetary benefits and no glory. Why do pioneers do it? They know that they are engaged in a lifesaving work. Motivated by deep love for Jehovah and for their fellowman, they feel a strong, personal obligation to help save lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:14-45:1:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 1:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:16</a>) A pioneer couple summed it up well by saying: “Why are we pioneering? Could we ever justify it before Jehovah if we did not?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Another sister wrote this about her decision to start pioneering: “My husband and I made plans to live on a single income, which meant giving up all nonessentials. Yet, Jehovah richly blessed us, never abandoning us to poverty or need. . . . I have found a real reason for living​—that of helping needy ones to come to know that Jehovah, the true God, is not far from those who seek him.” Seeing the urgency of the times, pioneers are content with the necessities of life while they earnestly seek to acquire spiritual treasures that will last forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:18-54:6:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>If your personal circumstances permit, why not join the hundreds of thousands of your brothers and sisters worldwide who are pioneering? That way you can experience their same joy.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN HIS Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said to his disciples: “You are the light of the world.” He went on to urge them: “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 5:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Italy the fine works of Jehovah’s Witnesses have not gone unnoticed. For example, their good conduct when attending their annual conventions brings praise to God, as the following reports bear out:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">▪ For years a woman in Terni, Italy, helped her daughter run a café that was located near the stadium in that city. She relates: “I noticed a huge difference between those who came for soccer games and the delegates at the conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses there. The Witnesses were more modest in their dress, and they were honest and respectful. I often used to ask myself how people of various races could get along so well.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“One day a Witness stopped me on the street and asked if I knew God’s name. I did not, and since I knew that Jehovah’s Witnesses are good people, I agreed to have her visit me. I had questions about the condition of the dead, which she answered from the Bible. Without hesitation, I accepted a Bible study, and two weeks later I began attending meetings.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“My daughter at first opposed me, but my conduct and determination changed her attitude. I began to study nine months ago. Today my daughter and her husband make appreciative comments to the Witnesses who patronize their café. As for me, I was baptized at a convention in this stadium.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">▪ After a convention in Roseto degli Abruzzi, a campsite manager observed: “I have noticed that Jehovah’s Witnesses are very honest in all they do. Last week, I had 40 of them at my campsite, and they did not create any problems. On the contrary, they are the only ones who come and tell you if they have an extra person staying in their trailer or tent. As far as I am concerned, they are the best customers you can have.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">▪ After the same convention, a hotel manager stated: “Jehovah’s Witnesses are all peaceful. They are not rowdy, and they go to bed early. They are really kind, honest, and well behaved. It would be wonderful if everybody were like them. Others steal everything—vases, ashtrays, even toilet paper and sugar! Nothing like that has ever happened with you. When your children take ice creams from the refrigerator in the evening, I don’t bother to go and check what they have taken. They figure out what they owe me and come to pay immediately. I have the utmost trust in them. How wonderful it would be if others were like that! I wish all my guests were Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are well-known in Italy, as in many other parts of the earth. They ‘maintain their conduct fine among the nations’ and thus bring praise to the true God, whose name they bear.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:12</a>.</p>

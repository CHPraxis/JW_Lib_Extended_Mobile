Who Is in Control?
“WHO rules the world?” If someone were to ask you that question, how would you reply? Most religious people might say “God” or “Jesus.” An article appearing in The Freeport News, a Bahamian newspaper, gave an answer that few would expect.
“I found a tract on my doorstep,” the writer of the article begins. “Normally I’ll ignore such a communication, but this time I decided to read it. The headline asked the question, ‘Who Really Rules the World?’” By reading the Bible-based tract, this woman learned that the ruler of this world is neither God nor Jesus but Satan the Devil.—John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; 1 John 5:19.
“Consider the cold-blooded excesses in monstrous cruelty,” the tract explains. “Humans have used gas chambers, concentration camps, flamethrowers, napalm bombs, and other heinous methods to torture and slaughter one another mercilessly. . . . What forces drive men to such loathsome deeds or maneuver them into situations where they feel compelled to commit atrocities? Have you ever wondered whether some wicked, invisible power is influencing people to commit such acts of violence?” Is it surprising that the Bible calls Satan “the god of this system of things”?—2 Corinthians 4:4.
Happily, the time is near when Satan and his demons will be no more. “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” (1 John 2:17) Yes, the Bible promises that those who do God’s will have the hope of living forever in a righteous new world. (Psalm 37:9-11; 2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:3, 4) What a relief it will be to have the evil influence of Satan and his demons removed!
After summarizing the contents of this small tract, the writer of The Freeport News article concluded: “I am really glad I read that tract . . .  because I too have been concerned about the state of the world, and who is in control.”

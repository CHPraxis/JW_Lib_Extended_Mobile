A Valuable Magazine
A NURSE from London wrote the following comments to the publishers of Awake!:
“One day I was talking with my new neighbor, Jackie, about my work with the elderly. ‘I have some magazines that they may like to read,’ she told me. I took her magazines to work and left them on coffee tables. On future visits I noticed that the magazines were well-thumbed, so people were reading them.
“Later I changed my job and began working at a hospital. I put some of my neighbor’s magazines in the waiting room. Once again I could see that they were being read. One morning when I was attending to an elderly lady’s hand, her husband said: ‘I hope it’s all right, but I took this magazine from your waiting room. It has a very good article in it that I want to share with my son.’
“The magazines have been a blessing to me too. Since I am still receiving training in nursing, I have used the information in these articles in my research papers, with good response from my teachers.
“My neighbor Jackie is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the magazine I have been referring to is Awake! What I have read in this magazine has helped me understand much about myself and about the future for mankind.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE South American leaf-cutting ant amazes biologists with its sophisticated gardening techniques. To provide food, this tiny insect cuts leaf fragments and gathers debris from the forest floor and brings these back to its underground nest. The ant then grinds these bits into a mash to feed its fungus garden. This leaf cutter instinctively knows how to keep its crop at an ideal temperature and humidity level to obtain the best results. To create new allotments, it will transfer cuttings from established crops to newer leaf beds. The leaf-cutting ant has even mastered the art of pruning to maximize fungal growth. Welsh researchers have observed that this skillful horticulturist adjusts its efforts according to the food needs of the nest, thus conserving time and energy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Gardening involves hard work, and the leaf-cutting ant is astounding in this regard. Little wonder that the Bible says: “Go to the ant, you lazy one; see its ways and become wise. Although it has no commander, officer or ruler, it prepares its food even in the summer; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:6-20:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>) Truly, the leaf-cutting ant’s instinct attests to the wisdom of its Creator, Jehovah God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:24-20:30:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A WOMAN from Miami, Florida, U.S.A., sent the following letter to a local newspaper: “On Dec. 10 my son’s wallet was picked out of his pocket at a flea market. It contained his driver’s license, Social Security card, etc., as well as $260.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“After reporting the loss to the manager, he came home. In the early evening he had a call from a Spanish-speaking lady who, with a [telephone] operator acting as interpreter, told him that she had found his wallet.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“She gave him her address. . . . She gave him the wallet, which was intact, including the $260.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“She had seen the thief lift his wallet and yelled. The thief dropped the wallet and ran. By that time my son had disappeared from her view, so she took the wallet home and called.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“She and her family are Jehovah’s Witnesses. They evidently abide by their religious training.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses do not display honesty in order to receive praise from men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:7-49:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:7</a>) Rather, they earnestly desire to bring praise to their heavenly Father, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>) Their love for God and for neighbor impels them to proclaim the “good news” about God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) By means of the Kingdom, God promises to transform the earth into a beautiful paradise. Then the earth will be a place not only of physical beauty but also of moral excellence where honesty will prevail forever.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>

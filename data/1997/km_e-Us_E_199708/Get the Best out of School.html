<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>This is the time of year when many youths ask: “Do I have to go back to school already?” Although there may be some challenges and anxieties associated with returning to school, there are also many benefits to be gained by young people who apply themselves so as to get the best out of their education.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>A good basic education can contribute to one’s spiritual progress. What a person does during his youth has a great bearing on what he can accomplish as an adult. Even in the matter of schooling, “whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7</a>) Youths who diligently study their school lessons can acquire skills that will make them more useful to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Careful forethought is required if one is to make the right choices of school courses. Parents should help their children select the ones that offer the most practical training in order to reach spiritual goals in life. By developing their skills, youths will have the advantage of being able to support themselves in the pioneer work. Their basic education should help them to praise Jehovah no matter where they serve.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Young people, try to get the best out of your school years. In doing so, focus on living a full life in sacred service, rather than on pursuing a worldly career. Endeavor to use your life doing Jehovah’s will. Thereby, you will make your way successful, to Jehovah’s praise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:3-19:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 1:3</a>.</p>

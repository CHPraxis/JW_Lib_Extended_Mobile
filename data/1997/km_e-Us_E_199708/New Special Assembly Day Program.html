<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Do All Things for the Sake of the Good News” is the theme of the new special assembly day program starting in September. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:23-46:9:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:23</a>) The Kingdom good news is the most important news heard today. The program will help us appreciate the unique privilege we have to be bearers of this wonderful news. It will also embolden us to keep declaring the good news without letup.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The program will show us how to utilize our theocratic training fully so that we can accomplish the most in the ministry. We will hear from some who have made adjustments to expand their service, including young people who are giving their all to further the good news.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:22-50:2:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 2:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The principal talk, to be delivered by a guest speaker, will emphasize the need for us to remain “fit to be entrusted with the good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:4-52:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:4</a>) We will be helped to see that if we are to retain the privilege of sharing the good news with others, we must continually measure up to God’s requirements and standards in our thinking and conduct. The blessings that we receive from doing this will also be highlighted.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Do not miss this vital program. Newly dedicated ones who wish to get baptized at the special assembly day should inform the presiding overseer immediately. Invite all with whom you study to attend. Let us allow Jehovah to fortify us to do all things for the sake of the good news and thus complete the greatest work this side of Armageddon.</p>

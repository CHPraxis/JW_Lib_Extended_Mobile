<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>There is an ongoing need for Kingdom Hall construction worldwide. During just the last service year, 3,288 new congregations were formed. Many of these congregations are in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Previous issues of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>have reported on the progress of Kingdom Hall construction in a number of lands. Still, reports show that one country with 568 congregations has just one Kingdom Hall. Another country has one Kingdom Hall for every 129 congregations. Another has a ratio of one for 41 congregations. Several other countries, with a total of over 1,000 congregations, have not yet been able to construct even one Kingdom Hall. This is because of economic problems. While much work has been done, there continues to be a need. We feel sure that the congregations in the United States would like to assist many of these congregations in other countries to have suitable Kingdom Halls.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>This is in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:14-47:8:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>, which says: “By means of an equalizing your surplus just now might offset their deficiency.” Many countries have their own Kingdom Hall Fund, but their economic situation does not permit the local brothers to carry the load of building Kingdom Halls as needed. However, with help from brothers in other lands, the Society has been able to help build 413 new Kingdom Halls and remodel 727 others in just a four-month period in 75 different countries. In view of the continuing demand, there is a need to draw on the Kingdom Hall Fund in this country to assist with construction in other countries. While the funds in the United States will continue to provide loans for needed Kingdom Hall construction in this country, to the degree that these needs are being met and as funds are available, they will also be used to assist congregations outside the United States. We rejoice to see more Kingdom Halls built worldwide to Jehovah’s praise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:102:16-19:102:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 102:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:7-37:1:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:7, 8</a>.</p>

Starting in the latter part of the month, Kingdom News No. 35 will be distributed. November: Distribution of Kingdom News No. 35 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each home or dwelling with a copy of Kingdom News No. 35 may offer the Knowledge book.
▪ In every community at various times during the year, there are worldly holidays that excuse children from school and give time off from secular work. These make excellent opportunities for the congregation to have an increased share in the field ministry. The elders should anticipate when these occasions will arise and notify the congregation well in advance of the arrangements that are being made for group witnessing during holiday periods.
▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1998 service year is being sent to each congregation. Please use these forms with good discretion. They should be used only for their intended purpose.
▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1998 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Albanian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.
▪ From August 28, 1997, to August 30, 1997, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.

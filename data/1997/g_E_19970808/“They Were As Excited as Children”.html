<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how 32-year-old Sergei, the father of three children, described the reaction of his friends when he showed them the book <em>Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>Sergei, who lives in Tatarstan, Russia, describes what happened:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“To begin with we looked at the pictures and read the captions. Absorbing discussions followed. All my friends are young fathers and mothers . . . We all attend church at Easter and for baptisms, but that is the limit of our interest.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“On the other hand, what an interest we have in your literature! The colorful, beautifully designed cover of the book quickly attracts attention. When you start reading, it is difficult to stop. You want to share with neighbors what you have learned. Moreover, you feel satisfied and content after reading and discussing the information. At last, we have found something enjoyable, intelligent, and beneficial to talk about.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Indeed, we are living in a spiritual vacuum. Everyone talks about money, problems, worries, and intrigue. These things only devastate the heart. After thinking about them, you can’t fall asleep right away, and in the morning you don’t want to wake up and be plunged into the garbage dump of human troubles.”</p>

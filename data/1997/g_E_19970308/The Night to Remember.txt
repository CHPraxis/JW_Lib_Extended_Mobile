The Night to Remember
SUNDAY, MARCH 23, 1997
ON THE NIGHT before he died, Jesus Christ instituted with his apostles the Memorial of his death. At a simple meal in which he used wine and unleavened bread as symbols, Jesus commanded: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19.
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to share with them in remembering this annual Memorial. This year it will be held after sundown on Sunday, March 23, the date that corresponds to Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact meeting place and time.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An 84-year-old woman living in the United States said regarding <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>a 448-page illustrated book about the life of Jesus Christ: “I have read the Bible completely at various times, and the <em>Greatest Man </em>has helped me to understand my Bible reading better.” The book makes the Bible’s accounts of Jesus’ life come alive for her.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I never get tired of reading the book,” she wrote. “I have read it seven times and have started to read it again. My heart is moved by the marvelous qualities of Jesus. When I read the chapters about Jesus’ last week on earth, I am pained by the mistreatment he received, especially during his final hours, and by his death on the torture stake. Yet, he glorified our heavenly Father, Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>an effort has been made to present every event in Jesus’ earthly life that is set forth in the four Gospels. It can help you learn more about Jesus.

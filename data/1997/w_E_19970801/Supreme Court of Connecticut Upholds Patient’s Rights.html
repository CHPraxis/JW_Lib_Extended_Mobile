<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On April 16, 1996, the Supreme Court of Connecticut, U.S.A., upheld the right of Jehovah’s Witnesses to refuse blood transfusions. This decision reversed an earlier trial court ruling.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In August 1994, Nelly Vega, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, began bleeding severely after giving birth to her first child. Efforts to stop her hemorrhaging proved ineffective. As Mrs. Vega’s condition worsened, the hospital sought to obtain a court order authorizing a blood transfusion. Mrs. Vega had already signed a medical release instructing that no blood or blood derivatives be administered to her during her hospital stay, thereby absolving the hospital of any responsibility for the consequences of her decision. Nevertheless, the hospital argued that forcing a blood transfusion would be acting in the best interests of the newborn, who, the hospital urged, needed its mother. The trial court was also concerned that, aside from her blood loss, Mrs. Vega was a young, healthy woman. Thus, despite the protests of both Mrs. Vega’s husband and her attorney, the court granted the order and transfusions were administered.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In time, the case was brought to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. There, it was unanimously decided that the action of the hospital violated Mrs. Vega’s rights. The ruling stated: “The hearing before the trial court took place in the middle of the night, under extreme emergency conditions that were not conducive to the ability of either party to develop fully its arguments.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This ruling of the Supreme Court of Connecticut is significant for people other than Jehovah’s Witnesses. “It’s important for all patients who might not agree with their doctors’ decisions,” says Donald T. Ridley, Mrs. Vega’s attorney. “The ruling will prevent hospitals from steamrolling over patients’ values, whether religious or secular.”</p>

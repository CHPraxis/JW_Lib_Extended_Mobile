It Revives Hope
That was the sentiment of a man who received a copy of a four-page leaflet called Kingdom News. It was entitled “Why Is Life So Full of Problems?” The man’s letter regarding it was published in the newspaper El Tiempo, of Bogotá, Colombia. He wrote:
“In these times when everything seems to take place with acts of violence and corruption, when we feel that our hope is running out, it behooves us to seek a breath of spirituality to help keep our faith alive. Here is the gist of the text that was handed to me:
“‘The Bible reveals that God will intervene in human affairs by means of his heavenly government in the hands of Jesus Christ. This Kingdom will crush all corrupt governments from the planet. Will some survive the end of this world? Where will these survivors live eternally? The righteous will possess the earth. In God’s new world, death will be no more. There will be no crime, poverty, hunger, sickness, outcry, nor death. The dead will come to life again, and the earth will be transformed into a literal paradise.’”

What Bible Tracts Can Accomplish
In the city of Golitsino, near Moscow, Russia, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses gave the tract Enjoy Family Life to a woman pushing a baby carriage. The Witness walked on, but soon he heard the woman’s voice calling to get his attention. She was running to catch up with him, all the while pushing her baby carriage.
The woman said that she was interested in learning more, so the Witness gave her two more tracts on Bible topics. He also gave her his phone number so that she could contact him later. That same evening she called and arrangements were made for her to have a weekly home Bible study. Within only seven months, both she and her sister made a dedication to serve God and were baptized.
If you would like to read the Bible tracts Enjoy Family Life, Comfort for the Depressed, Who Really Rules the World?, and Life in a Peaceful New World, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the address nearest you that is listed on page 5.

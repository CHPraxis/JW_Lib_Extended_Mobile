Presenting the Good News With a Sense of Urgency
1 We show our deep appreciation for God’s Kingdom promises by sharing wholeheartedly in the Christian ministry. We need to participate in this work with a sense of urgency. Why? Because the workers are few, the end of this wicked system of things is drawing near, and the lives of those in our territory are at stake. (Ezek. 3:19; Matt. 9:37, 38) Such a weighty responsibility calls for our best effort in the ministry. How can we show a sense of urgency regarding our field service activity? By preparing good presentations in advance, by being diligent in searching out people wherever they may be found, by keeping an accurate record of all who show interest, by promptly returning to follow up that interest, and by remembering that since lives are involved, we should take our ministry seriously. The following suggestions may be helpful as we prepare to present the good news with a sense of urgency during February. The offer will be the book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!
2 You might be able to start a conversation by briefly mentioning some problems being faced in the community, and then you could say:
▪ “Many people believe that there is a God, but they wonder: ‘What kind of future does he want for us?’ How would you answer that? [Allow for response.] Did you know that the Bible clearly explains God’s will for mankind and the steps he is taking to accomplish it?” Turn to page 301 in the Revelation Climax book. Read Revelation 21:1 in paragraph 1, and then read the explanation given for it in the last half of paragraph 2. Turn to the picture on page 302 to illustrate what this means for our future. Read Revelation 21:4 in paragraph 6. If there is good response, offer the book. Be sure to explain how our worldwide work is supported by donations. Arrange a convenient time to return to continue the conversation.
3 You could follow up the previous discussion of Revelation 21:1, 4 with this brief presentation:
▪ “On my last visit, we talked about God’s promise to prepare a new earthly society for mankind. [Draw attention again to the picture on page 302 in the Revelation Climax book.] Would you like to see your family enjoy such conditions? [Allow for response.] The question is, How reliable are God’s promises? Please note what he himself says.” Read Revelation 21:5, 6a in paragraph 8 on page 303. Ask the printed question for paragraph 9 on page 304, and read the answer, including the last sentence of the paragraph. Mention the offer of a free Bible study. Arrange to demonstrate it later.
4 Since many are concerned about the growing problems facing mankind, you might say something like this on the initial call:
▪ “Nearly everyone is concerned about the problems we face in our community. [Mention a few.] For decades politicians have promised to bring about permanent solutions, and some have tried to do so. What do you think causes conditions to continue to worsen? [Allow for response.] The Bible offers an explanation that most people have never considered. The book of Revelation describes a war that took place in heaven. Notice the outcome, as stated at Revelation 12:9.” Read the verse, then turn to page 182 in the Revelation Climax book. Use the picture to explain Satan’s involvement in earth’s affairs. If genuine interest is shown, offer the book and mention the donation arrangement. Make plans to return and discuss how God will solve mankind’s problems.
5 If you promised to return to explain God’s solution for today’s problems, you might try this approach:
▪ “I made a special effort to come back so that we could continue our discussion on the real solution for the problems facing mankind. On my last visit, we saw that the Bible identifies Satan the Devil as the one misleading the entire inhabited earth. Since he is a superhuman spirit creature, do you think there is a way for his influence to be removed? [Allow for response.] Please note what the Bible says.” Read and explain Revelation 20:1-3. By using the picture on pages 4-5 of the Knowledge book, show what conditions will be like without Satan’s influence. Offer a Bible study and endeavor to start it on the spot.
6 With so many people interested in the environment, you could say something like this to open a conversation:
▪ “We have found that almost everyone is concerned about the pollution of our air, water, and food. In some countries the condition of the environment is already life-threatening. Since God is the Creator of the earth, what do you think he will do about this? [Allow for response.] The Bible says that God is going to call for an accounting of the way we use the planet. [Read Revelation 11:18b.] Imagine living on an earth that is free of all pollution!” Point out God’s promise of a paradise, as indicated at Revelation 21:3, 4. Show the picture on page 302 in the Revelation Climax book. If the degree of interest warrants, offer the book and arrange to call back. Give the person an opportunity to make a donation.
7 When returning to someone who showed interest in the Paradise earth, you might say:
▪ “On my last visit, we agreed that to solve the problem of a polluted earth, God will have to intervene in man’s affairs. But the question is, What must we do to survive into the righteous new world of God’s making?” Read John 17:3. Invite the householder to take advantage of our free Bible study course to gain this special knowledge.
8 What a privilege it is to be used as modern-day harvest workers and to do a lifesaving preaching work! May all of us keep busy presenting the good news with a sense of urgency, ‘knowing that our labor is not in vain.’​—1 Cor. 15:58.

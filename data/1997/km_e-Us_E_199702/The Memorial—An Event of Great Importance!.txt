The Memorial​—An Event of Great Importance!
1 On Sunday, March 23, after sundown, we will celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. (Luke 22:19) This is truly an event of great importance! By keeping his integrity to Jehovah until death, Jesus proved that it is possible for a human to maintain perfect godly devotion even under severe stress, thus upholding the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty. (Heb. 5:8) Additionally, Christ’s death provided the perfect human sacrifice needed to ransom mankind, making it possible for those who exercise faith to live everlastingly. (John 3:16) By being present at the Memorial, we can demonstrate our heartfelt appreciation both for Jehovah’s love and for Jesus’ sacrifice for us.
2 All are encouraged to follow the Bible-reading program that is scheduled for March 18-23, as noted on the 1997 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Also, a family discussion of chapters 112-16 of the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived will help to focus our attention on the most important week in human history.
3 Can you increase the time you spend in the field ministry during the Memorial season? Many publishers will take full advantage of the five weekends in March to serve as auxiliary pioneers. Why not be among them? All of us can have a full share in emphasizing the importance of attending the Memorial. Since it falls on a Sunday, it will be easier for many to attend. Be sure to invite all Bible students and other interested ones to join with us. Share with them what is stated on page 127, paragraph 18, in the Knowledge book regarding the one day of the year that is to be specially observed.
4 Approach this greatest event of 1997 with deep appreciation for all that Jesus’ death means for us. Be present on the evening of March 23, when true Christians everywhere faithfully observe the Memorial.

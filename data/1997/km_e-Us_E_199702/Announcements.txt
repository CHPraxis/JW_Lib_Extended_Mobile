Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! March: The Secret of Family Happiness. April and May: Individual copies of The Watchtower and Awake! For midweek service and in territory that is covered frequently, the new brochure, What Does God Require of Us?, may be used.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1, 1993, and October 1, 1992. Also see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March, April, and May should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation.
▪ On Saturday, May 10, 1997, the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.

“It Was the First Book He Ever Read”
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine often speak with those waiting for trains. One woman who showed interest in the Bible was provided with a copy of My Book of Bible Stories, a publication that makes generous use of pictures in its chronological history of the Bible.
Later, at the same station, the woman saw the Witness again and thanked her for the book, explaining: “My son did not want to study his schoolbooks. He hardly read them at all. But when I gave him the Bible Stories book, he saw the pictures and had a strong desire to read it. He read the entire book within about two weeks. It was the first book he ever read. But most of all, he rejoiced to get to know God. And I myself am rejoicing to see these changes in him. Please give me something more to read.”
Another woman was standing by and heard this story. She asked if she could get a copy of My Book of Bible Stories. You too can obtain a copy of this 256-page book or have someone call at your home to discuss with you the value of Bible education, by writing to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the address nearest you listed on page 5.

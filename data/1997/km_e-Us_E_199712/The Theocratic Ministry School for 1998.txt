The Theocratic Ministry School for 1998
To be schooled means to be “taught or drilled in a specific knowledge or skill.” Through the Theocratic Ministry School, we are constantly being trained in the knowledge of God. Also, our participation in this school allows us to develop our speaking and teaching skills. The school program for 1998 will afford us many opportunities to make further spiritual progress.
As you examine next year’s school schedule, you will note that occasionally Assignment No. 3 will be based on a Bible character as found in the Insight volumes. What is more, the Family Happiness book has been added to the curriculum for 1998, and Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 will cover it progressively. Whenever the Family Happiness book is the basis for Assignment No. 4, a brother should handle it as a talk to the congregation. And, as a reminder, no one on the school program should go overtime.
A New Feature: For our personal benefit, a “Supplemental Bible-Reading Schedule” is set forth in brackets right after the song number for each week. Although no parts on the weekly school program are based on it, make it your goal to follow it. This will enable you to get into the habit of reading the Bible daily if you are not already doing so.
For more information about assignments, counsel, and written reviews, please read carefully the instructions found in the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1998,” as well as page 3 of the October 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry.
If you are not yet enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School, we invite you to enroll now. This unique school continues to play an important role in training humble and devoted servants of Jehovah to become better qualified as his ministers.​—1 Tim. 4:13-16.

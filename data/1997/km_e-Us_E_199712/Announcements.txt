Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: New World Translation with the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1985 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. February: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Concentrate on starting home Bible studies.
▪ Since the Gilead graduation will be held on Saturday, March 14, 1998, no tours will be conducted that day at the Society’s facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York. Any who have planned to visit on that Saturday should reschedule their visit to another convenient time.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1997 with their December literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The Memorial for 1999 will be on Thursday, April 1, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother each year.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>An estimated four billion Bibles have been printed in more than 2,100 languages and dialects, making God’s Word available to over 90 percent of earth’s population. Yet, there exists a famine in the world “for hearing the words of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:11-30:8:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 8:11</a>) Many people who have a copy of the Bible either do not read it or do not understand its contents. How can we motivate them to use the Bible as a practical guide in their life?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In December we will offer the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>Where interest is found, we may also offer the Bible translation that has benefited us for the past 47 years​—the <em>New World Translation. </em>This can be done by illustrating its clear, modern speech. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="78" href="jwpub://p/E:1101990135/10-10"><em>“All Scripture” </em>book, page 328, paragraph 6</a>.) We will demonstrate our keen appreciation for this gift from Jehovah by enthusiastically helping others to accept the Bible as God’s guide for all people.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You could introduce a presentation by using the tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible.” You might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “Even though the Bible is available to over 90 percent of the world’s population, few people regularly read it. What do you think is the reason?” Read the first two paragraphs of the tract, along with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>. Offer the <em>God’s Word </em>book. If the book is accepted, mention the donation arrangement. If refused, ask the householder to read the rest of the tract. Highlight the final subheading, “Foretelling the Future.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When returning to people with whom you left the tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible,” you might try this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ After reintroducing yourself, read the last two paragraphs of the tract. Ask the householder if he ever considered the possibility of living forever on earth. After he responds, say: “Jehovah’s Witnesses are certain that all the prophecies found in the Bible will be fulfilled, including the ones that predict a wonderful future for all people who meet God’s requirements.” Show the illustration on <a class="xt" data-xtid="79" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996046/11:302-14">page 13 in the <em>Require</em></a> brochure, turn back to lesson 5, and offer to discuss the answers to the listed questions, thus starting a study.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>In territory where people are religious, you might try this initial approach:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “We are encouraging greater respect for the Bible. Many families have a Bible, but they seldom consult it when they are having serious problems. Have you noticed this? [Allow for response.] Perhaps they believe that the Bible is outdated. This book, <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>gives convincing proof that the Bible is scientifically accurate and that it provides practical solutions for today’s pressing problems.” Highlight a few points from <a class="xt" data-xtid="80" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989038/">chapter 8</a> or <a class="xt" data-xtid="81" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989042/">chapter 12</a> of the book, and then offer it.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>When following up a placement of the “God’s Word” book, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “When I visited you last, we discussed how the Bible helps solve today’s complex problems. Those who have accepted it as God’s Word have also been helped to live happier, more contented lives. I <em>would </em>like to show you one of the practical Bible principles that is explained in the book I left you.” Discuss one of the Scriptural principles found in chapter 12, paragraphs 3-6, and conclude by reading paragraph 7. If interest is shown, offer a study either in the <em>Knowledge </em>book or in the <em>Require </em>brochure.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>The following presentation may interest older people:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">▪ “There was a time when the Bible was read in most homes and when families lived by its principles. Was it so in your family? [Allow for response.] Today it seems that many are too distracted to devote time to Bible reading or they feel that its moral principles are old-fashioned. <a class="xt" data-xtid="82" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989043/">Chapter 13 of this book, <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?</em></a><em>, </em>presents three true-life experiences of individuals whose lives changed for the better after studying the Bible. If you would like to read how the power of God’s Word helped them, I will be happy to leave this book with you.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong><em>On the return visit, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">▪ “When we last spoke, we agreed that the Bible’s moral principles are being ignored in today’s society. Should that disregard concern us? [Allow for response.] Jesus Christ placed a high value on taking in Bible knowledge.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>. Then share <a class="xt" data-xtid="83" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995012/7-7">paragraph 5 of chapter 1 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book. Explain our free Bible study program, and offer to demonstrate it.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Pray that Jehovah will bless all your efforts to turn attention to the Bible​—God’s guide for all people.</p>

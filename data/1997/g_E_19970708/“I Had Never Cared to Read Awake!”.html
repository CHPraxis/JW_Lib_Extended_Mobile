<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Those are the words of a student at San Jose State University, California, who is enrolled in an Environmental Studies course. She continues: “I had the impression that the magazine was going to preach to me—‘Go to church’ or, ‘Become a Jehovah’s Witness.’ Yet, when I read this issue (January 8, 1996, ‘Our Threatened Planet—Can It Be Saved?’), to my surprise it was very factual! The articles include a resourceful diagram of ‘Some of the World’s Major Environmental Problems,’ which maps places suffering from deforestation, toxic wastes, atmospheric pollution, water scarcity, species endangered, and land degradation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I still do not have children, yet I worry if they will have safe air to breath, parks to play in, or water to survive. . . . I commend you for these articles.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>now has a circulation of 18.3 million each issue in 80 languages, 56 of which are published simultaneously. If you would like to read this magazine on a regular basis, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, by phone or at the local Kingdom Hall, or write to the nearest address listed on page 5.</p>

“I Had Never Cared to Read Awake!”
Those are the words of a student at San Jose State University, California, who is enrolled in an Environmental Studies course. She continues: “I had the impression that the magazine was going to preach to me—‘Go to church’ or, ‘Become a Jehovah’s Witness.’ Yet, when I read this issue (January 8, 1996, ‘Our Threatened Planet—Can It Be Saved?’), to my surprise it was very factual! The articles include a resourceful diagram of ‘Some of the World’s Major Environmental Problems,’ which maps places suffering from deforestation, toxic wastes, atmospheric pollution, water scarcity, species endangered, and land degradation.
“I still do not have children, yet I worry if they will have safe air to breath, parks to play in, or water to survive. . . . I commend you for these articles.”
Awake! now has a circulation of 18.3 million each issue in 80 languages, 56 of which are published simultaneously. If you would like to read this magazine on a regular basis, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, by phone or at the local Kingdom Hall, or write to the nearest address listed on page 5.

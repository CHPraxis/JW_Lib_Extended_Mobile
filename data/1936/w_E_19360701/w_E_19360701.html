<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.’’—Isa. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH of hosts is the leader and commander* of the warriors who fight for righteousness. His forces are led by his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus, his mighty Son, and the armies of the Lord know no defeat. When Goliath, the big bully of the Philistines and servant of the Devil, defied the armies of the Lord, David the beloved, who was a type of Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, boldly said to the Philistine: “Thou eomest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.” (1 Sam. 17:45) The Israelite., foreshadowed the spiritual Israelites of this day, the seed of Jacob, that is to say, the remnant of God’s people. The arrogant, bold, rude and defiant clergy, led by the Itoman Catholic Hieiarcby, are united in war upon the true followers of Christ Jesus, who delivm the testimony of the King and the kingdom. Long ago Jehovah of hosts caused his judgments to be written and recorded, and now he gives his people to understand the meaning thereof that they may have full assurance that he who knows no defeat shall fight their battles for them. The antitypical Daxid includes all the faith ail members of the body of Christ, including the remnant now on earth, and these are face to face with the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergymen engaged in a battle that asks and gives no quarter. By his prophets God identifies Ilie clcrgj* or religious element under the names of “Esau”, “Edom,” “Idumea,” “Philistines,” and by other devilish names, but all mean the same thing. That Jehovah is going to execute them in due time he fully discloses to those who love and serve him. Therefore like David they go forth to the war confident that Ihe Lord will gain the victory. Concerning this war Jehovah says: “For my sword shall be bathed in heaven : behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. The sword of the Lord is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.”—Isa. 34: 5, 6, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> These positive words of Jehovah’s judgment show the end of the Hierarchy. Why will Jehovah execute this judgment against them? “For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of reeomprnecs for the controversy of Zion.” (Isa. 34:8) These prophecies are fully corroborated by the prophecy of Obadiah (verse 10), and to the consideration of that prophecy we now return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The revelation of the prophecy of Obadiah is a great encouragement to the people of God at the present time, lie who now truly fears God and is diligent to walk humbly with him, hence in accord with his commandments and law of his organization, will fear neither man nor devil, but with full confidence in the Lord he will courageously go forward to the performance of his duty. Jehovah commands his people now to ‘rise up against the clergy in battle’, and then the Lord addresses the religionists, the clergy who haxe xvickedly defamed his name: “Behold, 1 have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.”—Ohad. 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Since the days of Nimrod religion has been great, amongst the nations, and the chief means employed by the Devil to deceive the people. Since the organization of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that w ieked religious institution has posed as the representatixe of God on earth, and it is the greatest hypocritical crowd that ever afflicted the peoples of the xvorld. But the day is here xvhen Jehovah xvill make those religionists “small among the nations” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Il.V.)</span><span class="font3"> and greatly despised. That wicked institution, the Hierarchy, has for many years been a terror to the people of the nations; she has ruled by fraud, deceit, lies, coercion and oppression; that xvicked institution is guilty of all manner of blasphemy, and the men xvho make up that organization are haughty, terrible and cruel, and concerning them Jehovah pronounced his judgment in these xvords: “I xvill cause the arroganey of the proud to cease, and xvill lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.” (Isa. 13:11) Let Jehox’ah’s witnesses</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">now be strong in faith and bold in the warfare, knowing for a certainty that the day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in fighting the battle of Armageddon, and never will be, but they are now at war </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">as</span><span class="font3">ith Satan’s representatives on earth, and the faithful must and will remain firm and steadfast and quit themselves like men who are true soldiers of the Lord. The remnant is now doing real battle work by condantly declaring the judgments of Jehovah, making known his name, and holding high his standard that the people may learn that he is the only true God and Deliverer. (Isa. 62:10) By the proclamation of the truth Jehovah’s witnesses are laying bare the frauds of organized religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and this God is causing to be done by his servants under the command and leadership of Christ Jesus that in due time the commercial traffickers and politicians may see through the fraudulent claim of the clergy; and likenLe that the common people may see and understand how they have been deceived and defrauded by tin* clergy and rapaciously robbed of the fruits of their honest labor. By causing his truth now to be declared, and by exposing the blasphemy of the religionists, the clergy, the Lord makes these men “greatly despised”. Honest people of all denominations, and regardless of all nations or creeds, are now hearing the truth, which they believe and accept, and they despise the hypocrites that have slandered Ihe name of the fjord in order to satisfy their own cruel and selfish desires. Now Jehovah and Christ Jesus make that religious organization small by frustrating 1he tokens of the liars, and causing them to appear in the eyes of the people of the world as worse than nothing. “Thus saith the Lord, . . . I am the Lord . . . that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and inaketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish.”—Isa. 44: 2-1, 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“The day is here when Jehovah’s chosen nation shall stand forth and boldly battle for the truth. To them Jehovah now says: “Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength: for he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he laycth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; be bringeth it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor [the poor in spirit, the true followers of Christ Jesus], and the steps of the needy [who need and receive God’s help and protection].” (Isa. 26:4-G; Matt. 23:12) Like Esau, the clergy once had the opportunity of partaking of the birthright and they despised the same. They refused to make known the name of God and his kingdom, and now they fight with all their power to prevent others from seeing and embracing the kingdom. They exalt themselves and defy the Lord and spurn his Word, and to them the Lord Jesus says: “And whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself, ‘-hall be exalted. But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.”—Matt. 23:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ Esau went away from the land of promise and to gratify his selfish ambition built up an inheritance at Mount Scir. The Horites were dwelling in Mount Seir when Esau went there. They were cliff dweller-.. (Deut. 2:12) Esau dispossessed those earlier dwellers. Then the Edomites, or those descendants of Esau, perched themselves high up on the cliffs of the ro'-ks and they became cliff dwellers. Likewise the Roman Catholic Hierarchy clergy, because of selfish ambition to rule and control the peoples of earth, have pu J.id others aside, wrongfully taken possession of that whr'li did not belong to them, and built up an inheritam-e for their own selfish use. They dwell high up. claiming that it is their pope, or head of their organization, who is the foundation rock against which the gales of bell shall not prevail. They have not built upon the true Rock, Christ Jesus, the express image of Jehovah the Great Rock'. (Deut. 32:4) Thus the Edomites foreshadow the self-exalted clergy, particularly of (lie Hierarchy, who have ruled the people with ancmim-v and have scorned the truth and defamed Ihe name of God. With great pride the Roman Catholic dor' y crowd have exalted themselves on hitrh, the claim being made for the head of that organization that he is equal to God himself. Out of the mouth of the cloi&quot;\ they convict themselves and exhibit the giea 1i st amount of pride. The following is a quotation fiom one of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, high in aulhoi-ity in that institution. This quotation is taki n from Ferraris’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical Diclioiiarif,</span><span class="font3"> which appear, in that book under the subtitle or article “Papa”. Such blasphemous statements as the following are made for Rie sole purpose of overawing the gullible ptople to compel them to render obedience to the devilrh J I n r-archy: “The pope is of such dignity and highness that he is not simply a man but, as it were, God, and the vicar [representative] of God. . . . Hence the pope is crowned with a triple crown, as king of heaven, of earth and of bell. Nay, the pope’s excellence and power are not only about heavenly, terrestrial and infernal things, but he is also above angels, and is their superior; so that if it were possible that aneels could err from the faith, or entertain sentiments contrary thereto, they could be judged and excommunicated by the pope. . . . He is of such great dignity and power that he occupies one and the same tribunal with Christ; so that whatsoever the pope docs seems to proceed from the mouth of God. . .’. The pope is, as it were, God on earth, the only prince of tiie faithful of Christ, the greatest king of all kings, possessing the plenitude of power; to whom the government of the earthly and heavenly kingdom is entrusted. T'. :■ pope is of so great authority and power that he can modify, declare or interpret the divine law. The pope ean sometimes counteract the divine law by limiting, explaining, etc?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah foreknew the selfish exaltation of the hypocritical clergy crowd, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and therefore he caused his prophet to write: “The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?”—Obad. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The proud man becomes so impressed with his own greatness and importance that lie is blind to everything else, and therefore deceives himself. Continuing to follow in that course he is certain to fall. “Pride gocth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” (Prov. 16:18) Pride quickly leads one to the commission of presumptuous sins, which are a fhnme before Cod and all who love righteousness. “lie that is void of wisdom dcspiseth his neighbour; but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.” (Prov. 11:12) The Edomites perched high up in the rocks, regarded themselves as of supreme importance, and looked with contempt upon others. Likewise the clergy of the Hierarchy and their allo. have perched them-felves high up amongst nun, have deported themselves in an arrogant and proud manner, and regarded them-sclxes as far superior to the common herd. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy then calls gullible and trustful ]K’oplc who support and keep up their wicked organization “the Catholic population”, and compels thise poor people to confess to 1he wicked priests all their weaknesses so that the priests can extract money from the people and thus take advantage of them. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is cruel and scornful, proud and sex ere. They receive their support and maintenance fiom the common people, whom they have deceived and made believe that the clergy are the representatives of the Lord and that the Hierarchy is a divine organization. In order to further deceive the people those of the Hierarchy call themselves “father”, and all the Catholics other than 1he Hierarchy are called the “children of the church”. All the children these roosters have are illegitimate, because they make the rule themselves that they must not marry, manifestly not wishing to be confined to one particular family. The clergy crowd are far removed from the Great Rock, Jehovah God, and his Chief Stone, the Head and Foundation Stone, and Captain of his organization, who is Christ Jesus. If they were in fact following in the footsteps of the Lord, and truly representing him, they would not show partiality among men, but would remember that the Lord God and Christ Jesus are no respecters of persons, and would do likewise. Such men have no fear of God. They ignore his plain word which is addressed to all who claim to serve him: “Wherefore now, Jet the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it; for there is no iniquitv with the Lord our God, nor. respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.” (2 Chron. 19:7) Thc-.e hypocritical clergy push the poor on the side, make them confess to wicked priests by speaking to them through a hole in some cage or box, inside of which the priest is concealed. If a man of riches or influence comes to confess he is given much more consideration and in proportion to the amount he contributes through the hole in the box. Such is a practice particularly in the church at Vatican City called “St. Peter’s”. It is a common thing to see poor, wretched people kneeling on the flagstones in that building, dropping their coins thiough the hole and whispering in the cars of a priest inside 1he box. That such practice is despicable in the sight of God is shown by this declaration in his Word: “For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ; and ye have respect to him that wcarcth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not then partial in jourselxcs, and are become judges of evil thoughts? Rut if ve have respect to per-ons. vc eominilsau, and are. convinced of the law as transgressors.”—Jas. 2:24.9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The Protestant clergy of modern times follow in the lead of the Hierarchy. These scriptures apply to all who have agreed to do the will of God or who are in an implied covenant to do his will by reason of their claims, and certainly that includes the clergy xxho have assumed and claim to be the representatives of God. An exactly contrary course is taken by the men who love God, as it is written: “The Lori] is my rock, and my foitress, and mj deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, ami tho horn of my salvation, and my high tower.” (Ps. 18:2) “From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead inc to the rock that is higher than I.” (Ps. 61:2) The faithful followers of Christ Jesus trust in Jehovah, the Great Rock, and in his beloved Son, the Foundation Stone of his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> But the clergy, the antitypical Edomites, boast of their superiority and the strength of their organization. They make the worldly governments their “rock”. They clamber up into the high political places and participate in the councils of tho-e who rule under the poxver of the invisible god of this woild, Satan the Devil. Those clergymen have become skillful riders of the beast because the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the other clergy allied xxith her, falsely claim to represent God and Christ and at the same time openly and deliberately align themselves with the commercial traffickers and professional politicians and use their power to oppress and defi and the people xvho support them. God designates that hypocritical organization as “the xvhore”. (Rex<sup>r</sup>. 17; 3-15) Relying upon their own strength and acting with the commercial traffickers and politicians who support them, the clergy say, as the prophet of God foretold: “Who shall bring me down to the ground?’’ They well know that they find no support for themselves in the Word of God. They hear Jehovah’s witnesses declare the Word of God, telling the people of God’s expressed purpose to bring down the haughty and arrogant, and concerning which the clergy say: “Who are those pestiferous ones who seek to destroy us by constantly calling attention of the people to us in the light of the Scriptures? What can they do to bring us down? We are thoroughly fortified in our position, and the scourge shall not come nigh us. Hell shall not prevail against us.’’ But docs their pride and boasting hold them in security? Because they arc high and lifted up among cruel and selfish men, docs that make them safe? Jehovah answers those questions by his prophet and says to the modern Edomites; “Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thv<sup>T</sup> nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.’’ (Ohad. 4) The modern-day Edomites, the clergy, cannot perch themselves so high that God cannot reach them when he chooses to do so. Lucifer tried that very thing, and Jehovah gave him the full length of the rope and let him go, God biding his own good time to bring him down to the dust. Lucifer boastfully said: “1 will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.’’ To that proud and boastful claim of the wicked one Jehovah says: “Thou shall be brought down to hell [oblivion], to the sides of the pit.’’ (Isa. 14:12-15) “Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic: therefore will I bung forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour th&lt; e; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at tb.ee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.’’ —Ezek. 28:18, 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah thus states his rule concerning the selfexalted, the high, and mighty, who boast of their strength and do despite to the Word of God. The Lord Jesus said of these clergy that ‘they arc sons or the Devil their father’ (John 8:44) and their fate shall be the same as that of their father the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Now we are in the da.v of Jehovah. He is sending forth his servants to declare the day of the vengeance of our God, and thus they arc waging war against the modern Edomites, and when this part of their work is ended the Lord will smite the boastful oppressors to the dust. “The loftv looks of man shall be humblgd, andjjie haughtiness, of men shall be bowed down; and the Lord alone shall be exalted ip that day.” (Isa. 2:11) In this day of Jehovah all who love and serve him will sing, as the psalmist did: “Be thou exalted. 0 God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.”—Pss. 108:5; 113:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The ancient Edomites had kings long before the Israelites had a king. The record concerning Esau’s settlement indicates that Esau became great amongst his people and that his offspring, the Edomites, were ruled by kings, as it is written: “And these are <sup>f</sup>hc kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.” (Gen. 36:31) From the time the Israelites marched over the desert to the land of promise onward the Edomites manifested their enmity against the Israelites, God’s chosen people; and this shows that they were the seed of the Serpent. (Gen. 3:15) Likewise the modern-day Edomites long ago accepted the kings or visible rulers of Satan’s organization as the “higher powers” and they themselves became a part of those “higher powers”, and their influence has been to turn the people away from God to the earthly rulers, whom they call “the higher powers”. They attempt in this day to compel all people, including those wholly devoted to God, to bow to the dictates of Satan’s representatives. In all the years past the modern Edomites, the clergy, have been the open and avowed enemies of those who truly worship Almighty God and Christ Jesus, and who do so by proclaiming God’s Word of truth. That enmity of the clergy against the true followers of Christ. Jesus is conclusive proof that 1hc clergy are the “seed” of the Serpent their father, Satan the Devil, even as Jesus stated to the clergy of his day and as God declared concerning all who aie opposed to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> In 1914 Jehovah enthroned Christ Jesus as King, but the modern Edomites, the clergy, rejected Christ the King. The witnesses of the Lord went forth as ho commanded and declared to all who would hear that Christ is King, and that the Lord is in his holy temple, and commands all to give heed to his words, and yet the clergy rejected .Jehovah’s King and opinly declared themselves on the side of Satan's organization and themselves a part of it. Now they seek to feather their nest high up in the rocks by taking the lead in political matters and by compelling teachers of schools and school children to indulge in enforced flag saluting and to hail men, and this in utter disregard of God's plain commandments. (Ex. 20: 3-5) That hypocritical move on the part of the Hierarchy and their dupes is another effort on their part to destroy all who truly love and worship Jehovah God by bringing them into complete subjection to the dictatorial rule of the Hierarchy, their Jesuits, and political dupes. They w'ell know’ that they cannot find an occasion against Jehovah’s witnesses except they find it concerning the law of God. (Dan. 6:5) Therefore they set about to frame mischief by law, as God foretold. (Fs. 94:20) They well know that Jehovah’s witnesses are careful to obey every law of the land that is in harmony with God’s law, but now they frame laws that are directly contrary to God’s law, with the hope of catdiii'g Jehovah’s witnesses and destroying them. They well know that every true follower of Christ Jesus will obey God’s law first and all the time. (Aets 5: 29) The clergy take this course in order to carry on a ‘‘bushwhack” warfare against Jehovah’s witnesses. Those of the Hierarchy hide behind their political tools and direct them to fire their darts </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font3">the true followers of Christ Jesus. As a court magistrate, who is a tool of the Hierarchy and who presides in Irvington, N. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">J., </span><span class="font3">recently said to Jehovah’s witnesses: ”1 will fight you and stab you in the back. 1 will fight you to the bitter end.” Thus a judicial officer, who is sworn to impartially administer the law, openly shows he is under the direction and control and management of the Hierarchy, the Devil’s visible representative. The clergy nTu-e to fight in the open and in the light of God's Word because they well know that Ihe Word of God i.; against them. As Jehovah's prophet says: ‘They fight like women’ (Jer. 51:30), that is, they seek undue advantage, attack fiom the rear, pull hair, shoot from the dark, and do injury when they catch their adversary off guard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>IC</sup> Those who tiuly love God and bis King, who worship him in spirit and in truth, well know' that this is a time of war between the modern Edomites and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. It is not a war with carnal weapons, because Jehovah’s witnesses never me such weapons of wari'rre. The true and faithful (Oles use the “sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God”, and that weapon is mighty to the pulling down of the strongholds that are hid behind the mountain of lies. (2 (.'or. 10:4) Today the Edomites, that is, the clergy, are high and lifted up in their stronghold and they seek to hold their position by holding firmly 1o their alliance with the kings or rulers of this world. What they fear is to have their lies and hypocrisies cxjHised to view. They reason, and that correitly, that they might </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font3">some honest men amongst Ihe politicians and commercial traffickers who would not be pleased with their lies. It is the truth of God’s Word concerning his name, his King and his kingdom, that he uses to uncover that hiding place or refuge of lies. Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to lift high the standard of 1ho </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord, </span><span class="font3">which is the truth, and lead the way for the people of good will; and this means war. (Isa. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">62:</span><span class="font3">10) For </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font3">than a decade this war has been in progress, and it grows in severity with each year. The clergy alone are unable to withstand the onslaughts of truth, and therefore they enlist Ihe aid of the ruling powers to enact laws by which they may catch </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">faithful prodaimers of the Word of God, charge them with some offense, and east them into prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> It is this warfare of truth against, entrenched wickedness and hypocrisy that the Lord is using to awaken the Jonadabs, or “great multitude”. Christ Jesus, at the temple, is judging the nations; before him are assembled all the nations, and particularly now' is he dealing with so-called “Christendom”. He sends forth his faithful enlightened ones, who make up the “faithful and w'isc servant” class, and commands them to proclaim from the housetops what they have learned in the secret place of the Most High. To his faithful servants the Lord says: “Fear them not therefore, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.” Then he says to his faithful ones: ‘The waters of truth shall sweep away the refuge of lies.’ “Fear not them which [shall] kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10: 26-33 ; Isa. 28:17) If these words of the Lord are not applicable to war, and if this does not mean war, what is it? It is war to the bitter end, and in this war doubtless some of Jehovah’s witnesses will die, but the cause of Jehovah is certain to come through completely victorious. The faithful will not fear what the enemy can do, but trusts in the Lord and goes straight forward. Jehovah has given his word that “the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies”, and God always makes good his word. It is this warfare, that affords the opportunity for the “goats” to brand themselves as such and for the “other shoe])” of the Lord to identify themselves on the side of God’s organization. Let. not the sophbtry of men deceive you who are in the covenant for the kingdom. He not deceived by the worldly-wise or by the wily efiorts of Satan to have you believe that God’s people are now “getting nowhere”, but that “after Armageddon they will gather Ihe great multitude”. It is now that the banner of the Lord must be lifted up and carried boldly and fearlessly on, that the people of good will, that is, the great multitude, may see and heed the way to go. If we fail to do our duty, by slacking the hand, we shall lose everything. (Enk. 3: 17-20) Outs is to obey the commandments of the Lord, and he will see Io it that the results are according to his will. The Lord is “getting somewhere” right now, and doing it exactly according to his will, and for anyone to say that the servants of the Lord are “getting nowhere” means that such person is guilly of presumptuous sin. The Lord accomplishes his purpose as he wills. His word shall not return unto linn void. Let some men stand before jou and foolishly say, if they will: “Where are the Jonadabs? Where is the great multitude?” Anyone so saying does not have a vision and spiritual understanding of God's Word. Remember, you have covenanted to do God's will and you are in the covenant for the kingdom; that now you must blow the trumpet, sound the alarm, tell the truth, and cease not to do so, and that this must be done now, so that the great multitude maj hear the truth and find the way to Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> Jehovah liides his own due time when he will crush the enemy to the dust. To the proud, haughty, bushwhacking warriors, who underhandedly assault Jehovah’s witnesses and who declare that they are immune because they are high and lifted up, Jehovah says: “Though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down.” Be assured that God will accomplish that very thing; therefore be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and tight on. To the self-exalted modem Edomites Jehovah now says: “Thy terribleness [awe-inspiring position on the rocks of the world] hath deceived thee [into selfsecurity, complacency and independence of God], and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that boldest the height of the hill: though thou shouldcst make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord. Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.”—Jcr. 49:16,17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Haman was a descendant of Edom. (Gen. 36:1,12) He was exalted to the lofty rank of grand vizier of the emperor, became very scornful, haughty, arrogant and oppressive, and the Lord brought him down low. (Esther 3:1; 7:10) Edom is one part of Satan’s organization, which is Babylon, and the spirit of Babylon is that of Edom, and concerning that wicked crowd Jehovah says: “Come down, and sit in the dust, 0 virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shah no more be called tender ami delicate. And thou raidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember Ihe latter end of it. Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly; that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.”—-Isa. 47:1, 7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Hence in the* later Scriptures written at the instance of the Lord Jesus Edom is symbolized by the “great whore”. (Bev. 17:1-6) Because the descendants of Edom likewise stood for what is against God's people, the organization of Edom (the modern Edomites) is marked for utter destruction. Jehovah speaks </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Idumea, which is Edom, and states what shall come </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">pa.ss in the day of Jehovah upon the modern Edom</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ites: </span><span class="font3">“For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of rceompcnccs for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.” —Isa. 34:8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Let us always bear in mind that the complete destruction of the modern Edomites is Jehovah’s work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">be performed through Christ Jesus, and the part of the remnant in this war is to declare the day of the vengeance of our God, and to sing forth his name and praises to the end that those of the great multitude may hear and have an opportunity to take their stand </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font3">the side of Jehovah and his organization before the destruction of the enemy takes place; also that they must sound the warning, that others may have an opportunity to be warned. It is the Edomites of the present time that make war at the instance of the Bevil against Jehovah’s witnesses, who are of Zion, and concerning the destructive judgments of the Lord executed against them it is written: “For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.” (Isa. 34:5) The testimony by Jehovah’s witnesses must precede the destructive work and must be finished before the destructive work. (Matt. 24:14-22) Esau lived by the sword, and so the Lord Jesus says concerning the descendants of Esau, the Edomites, that they shall perish by the sword. (Alatt. 26: 52) First, however, the Lord shows that the refuse of lies binding together the modern Edomite.;, and behind which they hide their nefarious work, must be swept away, exposing the wicked ones to complete view of the world. That is the warfare in which God uses his ■ witnesses, and which warfare is now in progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The clergy have exalted themselves to the high places and have made commercial traffickers and political rulers believe that the clergy are absolutely essential to and constitute the chief part of the impregnable strength of earth’s governments. The Loid will see to it that the clergy, the modern-day Edomites, are put in their proper place, exposed to view, disgraced, and brought low; and concerning this it is written in his Word: “And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beaut, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall cat her flesh, and burn her v.ith fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will.” (Rev. 17: 16,17) Like Esau, the clergy of so-called “organized Christianity” long ago became, hunters, going about hunting with other elements of Satan's world, and despising the promises of God. They have lived by their own machinations and .schemes directed by the power and influence of Satan; which is equivalent to saying that they have lived by the sword. They have winked at or approved every war of conquest that has been carried on, and they have often hypocritically said that they arc for peace, while at. the same time attempting to bless the men who go forth to destroy each other. They have deliberately turned away from the Bible, and they hold it up to ridicule before the world, putting their own wisdom ahead of and in the place of God's Holy Word. They sold their birthright for a mess of pottage that they might satisfy their own appetites. They have made their choice and must abide in it. In this day when the promise to Abraham is made clearly to appear to those who love God, an 1 when these faithful witnesses, pictured by Jacob, eo about diligently and faithfully proclaiming the meaning of that birthright, the modern-day Edomites setk the death of these faithful servants of Jehovah In due time God will avenge his servants and magniiy his own name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DESOLATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah uses a striking illustration to show how completely the clergy shall be desolated. He compares the action of thieves and robbers with what shall come to the religionists, the hypocritical clergy: “Jr thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some, grapes?’’—Ohad. 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> To what extent would a thief or robber go? Thieves hastily grab what they see and go away. Gatherers of grapes leave some for gleaners. (Deut. 24:21) When Jehovah has caused the refuge of lies to be uncovered and the duplicity and hypocrisy of the clergy to appear, then he will leave nothing of that crowd, but will clean them out completely. Likewise in the war that is now in progress Jehovah’s witnesses in following and obeying the commandments of the Lord will spare no one, as Saul spared Agag. They must not be respecters of persons, but must be wholly obedient to the Lord. For many years the religious priests robbed and oppressed the Russian people, and when the day of retribution fell upon them there was an effort made by Ihe religionists to have some ecclesiastical grapes left in Russia. Call to mind that on February 2, 1930, “Pope’’ Ambrose Ratti publicly protested against “religious persecution” in Russia. That protest was immediately followed by a like protest from the archbishops of Canterbury and York, and by the chief rabbi of London, and by Archbishop Manning of New York, thus showing that the clergy all work together. Of the Hierarchy and the other clergy Jehovah will leave nothing, such as robbers and grape gathciers might leave. By his prophet he says to these hypocrites: “How art thou cut off!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The name Esau means “rough, perceptible to the touch”, expert to deceive. (Cen. 25; 25) The modern Esau (or Edomites) likes to “wear a rough garment [that is, a hairy garment (nmrpin)] to deceive” others and to make them think that the wearer is a prophet. (Zech. 13:4) Esau chose for his habitation a high country. (Gen. 3G: 8) The modern Esau or Edomites likewise have chosen the rough, cruel, beastly and inaccessible governments of Satan’s organization for their abiding place. Such high and fortified places will not save them from the wrath of the Lord: “How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!”—Obad. 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The ancient Edomites became very rich and filled their homes with loot stolen from the caravans that traveled between the Euphrates and Egypt. They collected heavy tribute from those who passed by their country and who engaged in commercial traffic. Likewise the modern Edomites, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, haie become exceedingly rich and have their storehouses full of great riches. Such riches they have obtained by fraud and deceit practiced upon the gullible people. On every payday of the factories and commercial institutions the Hierarchy sends the poor, deluded, black-hooded women about to collect tribute from the laborers on the pretext that it is for a good purpose, while those of the Hierarchy live wantonly upon what they collect. Those collectors enter the offices and business houses and leave with their pockets full. That organization employs coercion to extract treasure or wealth from the professional and businessmen, and threatens them with loss materially and spiritually unless they contribute liberally. That would be bad enough; but when we call to mind that the Hierarchy institution demands of the bereaved ones sums of money to give their dead what they term a decent burial, this is a cruel and wicked way to extract money from the people, to siy nothing about the fraud and deceit. The so-called “Protestant” clergy, among the wealthy population, with boasting words say, as one recently said at Pittsburgh: “This is a three-mill ion-dollar church, and who would dare place an advertising sign near it advertising these Jehovah’s witnesses?” But of all the hypocritical, arrogant and scornful religionists Jehovah says: “How are the things of Edom searched out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(fioth.,</span><span class="font3"> margin) stript bare] !” In the war that is now on, the remnant, acting under the commandments of the Lord, search out these things of fraudulent eeclesiasticism and expose them to public view by telling the truth, both of historical facts and of the Word of God. Thus the Lord is searching out ami stripping bare Ihe old “whore”, and when the work of his witnesses is done God will completely strip bare those who have laid up great treasure to satisiy their own greed and selfish desires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Vatican City holds great treasures that support the Roman Catholic Hierarchy' and sumptuously supply all the needs of that deceitful and powerful organization. Throughout all “Christendom” that wicked institution holds the choicest property and sites and there locates its buildings. In all nations that hypocritical organization maintains its official representatives in great luxury, their support coming from loot that has been extracted from the people by coercion, fraud and deceit. For years they have kept their great wealth hidden from the commercial powers, but now the time has come when the truth shall be known, and of that organization Jehovah says: “How are his hidden treasures sought out!” (AJi.V.) This is not man’s judgment nor the declaration of man, but the announcement of God’s judgment declining the day’ of his vengeance. The time has come for those who love God to make known those judgments, and they’ must do so because God has commanded it. Both the Scriptures and the facts show that the time has come to expose those who, for a long period, have defamed the name of Jehovah, and hence the Scriptures declare: “Therefore judge nothing before the time [and that time is here], until the Lord eome, who . . . will bring to light the hidden things of darknes'i. ” (1 Cor. 4:5) The Lord has come and is at the temple separating and judging the nations, and he sends forth his singers to proclaim the truth and to expose the hidden things before he strikes the devastating blow against the enemy. Clearly that those things might be emphasized in the mind of those who love and serve God, he also says by the mouth of another prophet, to wit: “If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin) </span><span class="font3">their sufficiency]. But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.” (Jer. 49:9,10) Thus Jehovah declares him'elf concerning the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy, the dc-famers of his name. The hidden treasures of modern Edom, in addition to wealth, such as houses and money, refer also to the political power of those religious organizations which they have and exercise among the commercial traffickers and politicians that rule. Among the hidden things that mu I be exposed, and which are now being exposed, are the religious mysteries and doctrines, and rites, so-called “last rites”, by which the clergy have deceived and defrauded the common people and taken away Ihe fruits of their labor, and still continue to deceive tin m, and thus cause the common people great want and suffering both mentally and materially.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The public press reports that the Nazis, by reason of persecution, arc compelling the Jews to sell their property at a great sacrifice, in Germany and that the Catholics are buying up that property. A criminal always leaves some loophole by which he exposes himself. This is another evidence that the Hierarchy is back of the Nazi organization, which is robbing a thrifty cla s of people in Germany, persecuting all others that do not bow to the. dictates of the, Hierarchy and the Nazis, and extending- favors only to those who support the arbitrary and dictatorial rule of that land. In due time the Hierarchy’s hand will be completely exposed in Germany and her nefarious work and her ill-got gains will be searched out and come to an untimely end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> When the Lord enthroned David as king of Israel Ihe ancient Edomites were the mortal enemies of David, and of the people over which he ruled, God's chosen people. The Edomites then kept a part of the territory which Jehovah had assigned to Abraham’s seed, and David was moved to act according to the will of God when he fought the Edomites. Now the great antitypical David, Christ Jesus, is on his throne and is commanded by Jehovah to rule amidst bis enemies. (Ps. 110:2) The modern Edomites, the religionists, are the mortal enemies of the antitypical David, including, to be sure, the remnant. Wrong fully the modem Edomitc.-&gt;, the clergy, assume the place assigned to the true seed of Abraham, and the antitypical David sends forth the members of his body, the faithful remnant, to expose the position of the enemy before he destroys them. The remnant arc therefore now acting under the command of the Lord when they publish to the world the truth of and concerning those hypocritical religionists who blaspheme the name of God and hrs kingdom and who oppose all who are in favor of his kingdom. This war is in progress according to the will of God. What appears in the Sr-rip-tures is not the word of man, and the citation of the facts with that of the Scriptures concerning the modem Edomites is not an accusation of man, but is ^ct forth according to the v. ill of the Lord that the refuge of lies may be stripped bare in this day. The remnant are not gathering the great multitude, beearre that is the Lord’s work. The remnant are proclaiming ihe truth that it might be known that Jehovah is the onlv true God, and that those who hear that message and who arc of good will toward God and put them-elves on his side and obey his commandments may join the great multitude. It is unreasonable and unscriptuial, and therefore foolish, for anyone to now say: “The work eve are now doing u small potatoes compaied vv it h what we will do after Armageddon, in gathering the great multitude.” The fact that Jehovah is revealing to his people now the meaning of his prophecies, such as Jehu, cities of refuge, Samson, concerning Ihe Philistines, and other prophecies, is conclusive proof that it is his will that the remnant should now know these tilings, which were written aforetime for their comfort and hope, and that they might </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iim:</span><span class="font3"> ll.e e truths according to the will of God in declaiing them to others. What will strengthen the hope of the n-,n-nant more than to know that they arc now' encaged in a work according to the will of God, and in which he commands them to serve notice upon others, tint tlu&gt;,e who are of good will toward him may learn the way to Zion, take their place with God’s organization, and form the great multitude that will forever praise Jehovah's name? Any attempt to make the remnant think that their chief work concerning the great multitude is some twenty vears future only tends to came Jehovah’s witnesses to become lax in their efforts, indifferent and negligent of their duties and prix ileges. The remnant, who are really devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, and who for the past few years have carefully studied the Lord’s prophecies as the Lord has unfolded them, will not now be induced to slack the hand. They see the war is on and that they mind, fight, and fi'fht continuously, and that their part of the fight is to proclaim the praise of Jehovah and to continuously offer before the Lord an offering in righteousness. The remnant are now hated by the ruling powers of all nations, even as Jesus was hated when he was on earth. The faithful remnant now (b-li'dit to bear the reproaches that reproached our Loid and Head. The inspired Word now applies to the remuaui, which says: “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.”—Heb. 13:13,15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">COURAGE AND VICTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">O THOSE who have fully agreed to do God’s will this speech is addressed. Jehovah has taken out of the nations a people for his name and lias put his name upon them. He has enthroned in Zion his mighty Executive Officer and sent him forth to crush the enemy and to vindicate God’s name. That means war in which is expressed the complete and full vengeance of Jehovah against the wicked one. It also means the supremo endeavor of the wicked one to destroy those upon whom Jehovah has put his name. In that conflict no quarter is asked and none given. To those anointed and commissioned by Jehovah he now says (Isa. G2:1): ‘I will not rest until the righteousness of Zion shall go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burnetii.’ The Lord has risen and he will compel all to know that he is God, whose name alone is Jehovah. The Lord is in his holy temple and commands all to be silent and hear his message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greatest favor ever bestowed upon man is to be on the side of Jehovah and to enjoy the privilege of serving in his organization. That favor is now possessed by a few persons on the earth. If you are one of such, happy is your lot and great is your responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To Jehovah’s anointed witnesses much has been given and much more entrusted, and concerning such Jesus says (Luke 12:48, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font3"> : “To whomsoever much has been given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been entrusted, of him [the more] will be demanded.” Jehovah has given to his people the truth and made known that he has permitted Satan to carry on his wicked work for a limited time, at the end of which time he causes a world-wide testimony to be given to those who will hear, and then he </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">m</span><span class="font3">ill exhibit his supreme power in the battle of his great day. lie requires his witnesses to deliver his testimony. To his anointed the Lord has entilisted his kingdom interests on the earth, and he demands that they shall render a full and satisfactory account of that stewardship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries honest persons have looked forward to and prayed for the coming of the Lord Jesus and his kingdom. That great event has now come. The primary purpose of the kingdom is to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and to this end he proves Satan a liar, that Jehovah is the only true Almighty God, the source of life, and that he can put men on earth who will remain true to him, and that he can and will establish righteousness in the earth. The secondary purpose of the kingdom is to give life everlasting to all who hear and render themselves in full obedience to God; that those who believe in God and Christ Jesus and prove faithful shall live; and that those who refuse to believe and obey shall remain with the Devil under condemnation and suffer destruction. Therefore God has entrusted to his witnesses the work of publishing these truths to the people, and those thus commissioned by the Lord who fail or refuse to give the testimony as commanded shall be destroyed. (Ezek. 3:17) The issue now' is plain and clear-cut, and there is no excuse to side-step it. Who will remain true and steadfast on the Lord's side and faithfully perform his obligation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the anointed ones Jehovah now' says (1’rov. G: 20) : ‘‘My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother.” The commandment of Jehovah is his w'ill expressed concerning those in a covenant with him. The mother of God’s sons is Jehovah’s organization, and the law thereof is the instruction that comes to the anointed through Christ Jesus, the head of that organization. It is written of this day: “Out of Zion shall go forth the law.’’ All the sons born of God’s organization are taught by Jehovah through Christ Jesus; therefore God and Christ are the only Teachers. (Isa. 5-1:13; 30:20) Jehovah through Christ has made clear to his people the meaning of his will, or commandment. Through Christ he gives instruction to those of his organization. The Lord demands, therefore, that his anointed shall be diligent in rendering obedience to his will and careful to obey and follow the instructions of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the expressed will of God given through Christ Jesus that ‘this gospel of the kingdom '-hall be proclaimed world-wide as a testimony’, and that Jehovah’s witnc.'.-&gt;cs must do this work to the final end. It is the law of God’s capital organization that the testimony work shall be done orderly under the supervision and command of Chri t Jesus. Ue is the antitypical Hoses, the great Prophet, and it is written that whosoever will not obey that Prophet shall be destroyed. (Acts 3: 23) The Lord has shown his people that he transmits his organization instructions through the channel of that organization now on earth. When you receive such instructions it is your duty and privilege to quickly and faithfully obey the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Obedience to Jehovah’s law and instructions must not be induced by the reward that is expected. To those who continue faithful unto the end the Lord will give reward, but that reward is incidental to faithful obedience. The motive or inducing cause to serve the Lord faithfully must be love. That means an unselfish devotion to Jehovah because he is altogether right and righteous. There can be no dividing of affection between God and any creature or thing. For this reason his commandment of first importance is: ‘Thou shalt have no other god besides Jehovah, and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul and mind.’ His rules do not change, and they apply to all creatures who have agreed to do his will. Such persons cannot salute flags or hail men, thereby attributing protection and salvation to human creation or power. All those who love God and his Christ must and do attribute protection and salvation to God alone through Christ Jesus his King. (Ilev. 7:9-11) The sons of God who are true followers of Christ Jesus will do no injury to anyone. They will obey all the laws of the land that are in harmony with God, but they will obey no law that requires them to be unfaithful to Jehovah and his kingdom. They w ill obey God rather than men; and this they will do, by his grace, at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In obedience to the Lord’s commandment his faithful witnesses now carry the message of truth to the people and thereby they worship Jehovah as he has commanded. This brings down upon them the wrath of the Devil and of all his earthly agents because the Devil and his agents are in a conspiracy to d.^troy all who serve God. (llcv. 12:17; Ps. 83:1-5) Some who have started to do the will of God have become fearful and fallen back, but those who love God delight to do his will and trust him implicitly and in the face of groat opposition they continue the forward movement and the Lord comforts and strengthens them. Upon the. plains of Moab Moses assembled the people of the Lord and spoke to them at Jehovah’s commandment. Moses was a type of Christ, and his words are recorded for the comfort of the remnant now on earth. (Korn. 15: 4) The Greater Moses now says to Jehovah’s witnesses (Deut. 20:1; 31:6) : ‘When thou goes! out to battle against thine enemies, be not afraid of them; be strong and of good courage; fear not; for the Lo-d thy God, he it is that doth go with thee. He v. ill not fail thee, nor forsake thee.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Courage means to have implicit confidence and ti u .t in the supreme power that backs you up. JehovJi and Christ Jesus are the higher powers to all who ai&lt; in the covenant with God. All power belongs to Jehovah, and he has committed it into the hands of Chri-t J; -u; Io execute the same, both in heaven and in eai th. 1 he courageous ones are those who study e.ircitiily the truth whi&quot;h the Lord unfolds and gives to them through his earthly channel, and who then jov I ully follow organization instructions, trusting v.ho’lv in the Lord. The relf-iinportant ones will rot be coui.i-peous, because they trust not in the Loid, but tuist in their own wisdom and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very hour of Armageddon is not revealed, 'flic fact, however, that the Lord Jesus is at the temple, that he has revealed to the anointed the meaning of the prophecies of Habakkuk, and particularlv vvhv God's people are now persecuted, and the me.min&quot; of the song of deliverance, and that he has revealed the true meaning of the great multitude, and of the Philistines, and like prophecies, these facts are strong proof that Armageddon is very near. To know jti-t how near is not so important, but it is of far greater importance that the witnesses of Jehovah now be en-r-gctic and diligent to obey the commandment-, of. the Lord and observe the laws of his organization. To do so they must carry the message of the kingdom to the people, and faithfully do it, regardless of all oppoH-tion that the enemy puts forth. No true vvitne-s of Jehovah will now say to his brethren, “ We are getl ing nowhere.’’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Tic Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> contains only the opinion of man.” Such remarks show unfaithfulre-s. Jt is the day of Jehovah, he is leading his propio ami to those of his organization he now says (Zeph. 3: 16): ‘Fear thou not, and let not thy hand be &lt;lai k.’ Tho e who are fearful of man are selfish, and such will be hunting some excuse to slack the hand in serving, hoping that a more favorable time will come. The faithful will not be deceived by such sophistry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has not approved and never will approve an unfaithful person. In this day when the Lord has given much to his people and has entrusted to them all his kingdom interests on earth, absolute faithfulness in the sendee he demands. Faithfulness means fidelity and constancy in looking well to and safeguarding the interests of the kingdom. It is not enough to say, ‘I am on the side of Jehovah,’ but now all who receive his approval must show an unqualified devotion to God and to his organization. The words of Jehovah’s prophet now apply to all who are in the covenant with him, to whom he says (Ps. 31: 23): </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“0 </span><span class="font3">love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserv-eth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer”; and (Ps. 101:6): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes shall be upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An issue vital to God’s people now is, Shall those of God’s organization fail, or shall they maintain their integrity and have part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name? Jehovah declares that his name shall be vindicated; and having enthroned his King in Zion he will not lest until the righteousness thereof shall appear and salvation from Zion shall shine as a burning lamp upon a high mountain, that the nations may know that he is God. The faithful and true witnesses will courageously and joyfully obey the Lord and will du ell with him for ever. The fearful, selfish and mur-murers shall be excluded, berau'c the Lord declares his angels shall gather them out and cast them into darkness. Jehovah has put his name upon the faithful ones and has declared that he will use them to make known to the nat ions that he is supreme. For this purpose he now holds forth the faithful as a royal diadem in his hand. To you who are faithful Jehovah now commands: ‘Prepare the way before the people; lift up a standard for the people, that they may see the right way.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan will see to it that some who count themselves wise, but who do not love God, will mingle with the anointed and attempt to tell them that this is not the time to awaken the great multitude, but that later more will be done. The subtle purpose thereof is to induce inactivity on your part. Be not deceived by such speech! God’s Word says that the great multitude must hear the truth now that they may have opportunity to learn meekness and righteousness before his wrath at Armageddon, and the remnant must deliver that testimony. The admonition to the remnant now is: Be watchful, be diligent, and very courageous, and march forward regardless of the cunning speech of men and of all other opposition. The faithful will be on the alert and very active at all times in God’s service, obeying joyfully his commandment and the law of his organization: “For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.”—Prov. 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the things written in the Bible aforetime, for the comfort of God’s people now on earth, is that prophetic drama concerning the ancient Philistines end the chosen people of God. The modern or antitypical Philistines are the ones that dominate the religion and politics of the world and are known as the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. The secret service agents of that wicked organization are the Jesuits, who have fraudulently assumed the name of Christ. The ancient Philistines came out of Egypt, which is a type of Satan’s world. They took their position in the land of promise and there opposed God’s chosen people. The modern Philistines claim to have come out from the world of Satan and they wrongfully assume the position as representatives of God and Christ. The ancient Philistines were hypocrites. The modern Philidincs are the greatest hypoeiitcs of all time. Long after the destruction of the power of the ancient Philistims God foretold by his prophet that the modern Philistines, the Hierarchy of Borne, would say and now do say (Isa. 28:15) : ‘We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehoods we have hid ourselves; therefore the great tribulation shall not come nigh us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the lies deeply planted by that wicked organization in the mind of millions of people are these; They claim that their organization, called the “Boman Catholic church”, is the church of God; that it is founded and built upon the apostle Peter, and that the popes are the divinely constituted successors of Peter, and that the pope speaks with absolute authority and he alone can interpret the Scriptures; they claim to have a covenant with death and bell, having issued an authoritative statement that there is no death, and that hell is a place of eternal torment for 1 hose vv ho oppose the Boman Catholic H icrarchy; they have invented and promulgated the false doctrine of “purgatory”, claiming that men do not in fact die, but pass on into “purgatory”, ‘where they suffer much punishment, ’ and that for a money consideration a priest of the modern Philistines can shorten the duration of punishment of men in “purgatory”. This racket or false teaching has been the means of deceiving and fleecing millions of honest people. The modern Philistines claim that it is their God-given privilege and duty to control the politics of the world and to rule the nations of the world. They have about succeeded in bringing all nations under their control, for the reason that the Hierarchy is the Devil’s chief visible agent. The once so-called “Protestantism” is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The modern Philistines instituted and carried on for years the wicked and cruel Inquisition, applying the most fiendish torture to men in order to force them to submit to the false faith and dictatorial rule of the Hierarchy. Today the modern Philistines have reestablished the Boman iron rule in some of the nations and are using that power to torture and persecute those who refuse to yield to their wicked demands. As the ancient Philistines were bent on the desti-uction of God’s chosen people, even so today the modern Philistines are bent on destroying Jehovah’s witnesses and all those who boldly take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom. In Germany alone more than two thousand faithful witnesses of Jehovah languish in filthy prisons because they worship Almighty God in spirit and in truth. Many of these faithful witnesses have been cruelly tortured. Men and women are forcibly sterilized and others brutally murdered because they insist on serving God and not man. In other portions of the earth the modem Philistines are forging a well-organized campaign of cruelty against all who tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why does this terrible and wicked condition continue? It is because we are in the last days of Satan’s rule. Christ, the rightful King of the world, is upon his throne and has assembled and brought into God’s organization those who are with him. The enemy has gathered his forces to Armageddon for battle, and those wicked forces now surround God’s faithful people, and the hour of final conflict between the Lord and the Devil draws near. The modern Philistines by the use of fraudulent and hypocritical ceremonies, such as enforced saluting of flags and hailing of men, arc thereby attempting to browbeat the people, and put fear into their minds, so that the Philistines may rule all the nations. This is the Devil’s scheme to turn all men away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has permitted these conditions to come because it is the time for the separation of the nations when all people of good will toward God will take their stand on the side of the Lord and find the only place of salvation. The Lord therefore commands his witnesses to go forth and sound the alarm and to give the warning, that those who desire to hear may hear. The Lord has clearly revealed to his people that those who will compose the great multitude must hear the testimony of and concerning his kingdom before the expression of God’s wrath. His witnesses must give that testimony regardless of opposition and persecution. The crisis is here, and now the Lord says to his own: ‘Fear not the enemy; what I have revealed to you in secret, boldly declare from the housetops.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The forward movement throughout the land is progressing. The Lord has caused to be published a book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches;</span><span class="font3"> setting forth the plain truths of and concerning his kingdom and fully exposing the enemy, and particularly the modern Philistines. That book is now ready in many languages and all over the land the faithful go forth as one man joyfully putting that message in the hands of the people, that they may sec and know that Jehovah is the only true God and that his kingdom is the only hope of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In many nations there are honest persons who sigh because of the abominations they see committed among men, and which defame God’s name. It is Jehovah’s time that such persons of good will shall have the opportunity to hear the truth, that they may be warned and helped to flee to the only place of safety, pictured by the cities of refuge. God commands his remnant Io go through the land and mark the foreheads of those persons of good will by exhibiting to them his message of truth, and he commands that this work must be done before the expression of his wrath. After the expression of his wrath would be too late, because only those who are taught and learn righteousness shall escape. Who will have a part in that witness work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s remnant, being of the bride class, will engage in this work. The Jonadabs, or great multitude, will hear and also join in the witness work, saying to the people, “Come.” And those who hear and who desire righteousness and hate iniquity will say, “Come and find the way to everlasting life.” Everyone who loves God will have a part in this witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidence points clearly to the fact that the time for God’s “strange act” is very near, and that will be the time of full reckoning with the enemy. Jehovah speaks to the modern Philistines and commands his witnesses to repeat his words in the hearing of the people, to wit (Isa. 28:18): ‘Your covenant with death and agreement with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down; for Jehovah will rise up as he did at Mount Pcrazim and at Gibeon, and will destroy the enemy.’ At the two points mentioned David led the forces of the Lord and gained a great victory. Christ Jesus, the Greater David, now leads the militant forces of Jehovah, and will gain the greatest victory of all time; and they that stand firm and joyfully with him shall have part in that victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today the modern Philistines are battling to gain control of the world. They may soon succeed in compelling everyone to submit to them, except the true people of God. These latter appear so small in number, and, they refusing to employ physical force to resist, the modern Philistines will soon say: 'We are in control of the world; we arc now in peace and in safety, and the ranting of this handful can do us no harm.’ Says the Lord concerning the modern Philistines (1 Tlicss. 5:3): ‘When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction shall come upon them, and they shall find no way of escape.’ As David crushed the ancient Philistines, so the Lord will crush the modern Philistines’ organization; and when tiiat is done, then many who looked with awe upon the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as God’s representative on earth will exclaim: “How strange!” It will appear strange to them because it is God’s “strange act”.—■ Isa. 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not for us to know just in what manner God will perform his strange act, which he pictured at Gibeon. Our work is to do what God has commanded us to do. For the encouragement and comfort of his people Jehovah gave prophetic illustrations in times past. When the men of Ephraim joined Gideon’s little band of warriors thus Jehovah foretold that the invisible host of heaven, under Christ, will join the remnant and push the battle to a victorious end. When David was inarching to attack the Philistines at Gibeon the Lord said to David: ‘When thou hearest the sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then shall the Lord go out before thee and smite the Philistines.’ Clearly it appears that the ‘sound in the mulberry trees’ pictured the invisible host of heaven engaging in the fight under the Greater David. We know that it is our duty to attack the enemy Iroldly by loudly singing the praLcs of Jehovah, and that it will be the invisible host of heaven under Christ Jesus that will enter the battle and completely destroy the enemy. It is now clear that our part is to joyfully carry this Kingdom message to the people of good will. Within ourselves we are unable to cope with the enemy; but our extremity will be the Lord's opportunity to smite the enemy to the dust, and give victory to his faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let all those who engage in giving the testimony as commanded by the Lord rejoice because the day of victory and deliverance is at hand. In this work Jehovah’s anointed will be in complete unity and dwell in peace. The remnant will aid and comfort the Jonadab company. The Jonadabs, or great multitude, will be at peace and walk harmoniously with the remnant. All will stand shoulder to shoulder and battle for this gospel of the kingdom. The true and faithful will not fear what the enemy may do to them, but will trust in the Lord and continue to sing his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You anointed ones are the sons of God, and his command you must obey. Far better it is to die at the hand of the enemy because of your faithfulness to Jehovah than to prove unfaithful to him and suffer everlasting destruction. To his sons Jehovah now says (Prov. 29: 25): “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe”; and (Prov. 1-1:26): “In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall have a place of refuge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Jehovah said to his people of old, so now he says to those who fully trust him: ‘Be very courageous, and be not afraid; for Ihe battle is not yours, but God's.’ Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Kight Arm in this battle, and he is certain to gain complete victory over the enemy. From henceforth every person who love; God and Ilis King will in obedience to his command boldly and courageously lift high the banner of his kingdom by diligently and enthusiastically engaging in the witness work, and with increasing joy will continue to sing, “For Jehovah and for 11 is Vindicator” When the fight is ended all surviving creat.on will be singing the praises of the Most High and saying; ‘llis Holy Arm has gotten him the victory.’</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>OBADIAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“For </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.” —Obad. 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH GOD is the Most High, and before him there is no other. Any creature who exalts himself to a high place commits a presumptuous sin and so is an abomination in the sight of God. It was Lucifer who said: ‘‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” (Isa. 14:14) The Devil formed a conspiracy against God and drew into that conspiracy a host of spirit creatures and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">multitude of earthly creatures. Those conspirators have defied God and reproached his holy name. The end of such conspirators is destruction, and Jehovah has so written the judgment. (Ezek. 28:18,19) God’s rule is established, and he changes not. Destruction is the fate of all the wicked conspirators. The name of Jehovah is directly related to his faithful people. Those who hate them hate Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Those who conspire against the people of God conspire against the Lord himself. Jehovah has exalted Christ Jesus to the highest place in his organization. A hill is the highest part of the mountain, that is to say, it is the very pinnacle of the mountain ; and concerning the position in which God places Jesus he says: &quot;Yet have I set my </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">king </span><span class="font5">upon my holy hill of Zion.”—Ps. 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The Devil, Gog, the wicked angels, the clergj’ and others conspire together against God and against his anointed. (Ps. 2:2,3) Christ Jesus, the King and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge, </span><span class="font5">now at the temple sends forth his anointed ami approved ones to proclaim the message of the king</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dom, </span><span class="font5">and those who prove </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">true </span><span class="font5">and faithful to him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">declaring that message form </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">part of the holy nation of Jehovah. The haters of God and of Christ and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">faithful remnant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">conspire </span><span class="font5">together to destroy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the remnant or </span><span class="font5">“holy nation”, as it is written: &quot;They </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">no more in remem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">brance. </span><span class="font5">For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*In the conspiracy here mentioned the Edomites are specifically named. (Vs. 6) In the present-day conspiracy to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses the chief ones on earth are the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or clergy. Into that conspiracy or confederacy have been drawn the commercial traffickers and professional political rulers. Now, says Jehovah by his prophet Obadiah: “All the men of thy confederacy [All thy covenantmen (A’ot/i.)] have brought thee even to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that cat thy bread have laid a wound under thee; there is none understanding in him.”—Obad. 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘The clergy have taught their other confederates to hate those who are on the side of Jehovah and his King, and for that reason the faithful witnesses of Jehovah now are “hated of all [nations] for my name’s sake”, says the Lord. (Matt. 10: 22) The conspirators are al) against God and Christ and his kingdom and all who are favorable to that kingdom. Those in the conspiracy or confederacy aside from the clergy are doubtless the ones described as &quot;the principal of the flock” of the religionists. These are the &quot;kings of the earth” who have &quot;committed fornication” with Edom, the old &quot;whore”, the religious systems. (Rev. 17:1,2) They constitute the &quot;threescore and six” elements in the number of the beast. (Rev. 13:18) Concerning these confederate men, the principal of the flock, the Lord by his prophet says: For they &quot;brought thee [ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Jl.V.</span><span class="font5">) brought thee on the way] even to the border”, that is, to the boundary line or to the limit, to the exit or jumping-off place. Those co\e-nant men, that is, the commercial and political elements, come to discern the hypocrisy of the modernday Edomites and they show those Edomites the exit and tell them to get out. In this connection it is interesting to note that at the battle in the valley of Bcrachah Jehovah of hosts, the God of battle, confused the allied forces so completely that Moab and Ammon fought against Edom first and destroyed the Edomites, and thereafter &quot;every one helped to destroy another”. (2 Chron. 20: 23) This picture seems to imply that the &quot;principal of the flock” will drive the clergy into the hands of a mob from which they will receive no sympathy. That docs not at all mean that the principal of the flock or the mob will then</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">show any favor to the remnant of Jehovah. Those who serve God look to Him and his King and to none other for aid and protection.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Continuing to address his words to the Edomites, Jehovah by his prophet says: “The men that were at peace with thee </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font5"> the men of thy peace] have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee.” According to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font5"> this scripture reads: “The men thou wast wont to salute,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or, </span><span class="font5">“The men wont to salute thee.” More literally, and according to the marginal reading of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font5"> “The men of thy salaam.” The present-day facts exactly fit this part of the prophecy. Today the clergy and ‘the principal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">their flock’, the commercial traffickers and politicians, have formed a mutual admiration society. The clergy pay high compliments and great respect to the big politicians, whom they call “great statesmen”, and to the money-changers, whom they eall “great financiers”. In their sermons or speeches from their pulpits they extol the goodness and the virtue of these principal ones of their Hocks, at the same time holding their hands behind them, and wholly ignore the name of Jehovah and his King. The “principal of the flock”, the politicians and commercial traffickers, pay great respect to the clergy, calling them “father”, “reverend,” “doctor,” and similar titles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> A </span><span class="font5">leading politician of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">present day made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">»sj&gt;eeeh on the 23d day of February, f 936, calling upon all the clergy, regardless of denomination, to form a “brotherhood”, as he called </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it, </span><span class="font5">and join hands and stand firm together against those who are exposing or attacking their “faith”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">clergy and the principal of the flock praise each other and pat each other </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">the back. When there is a great function, political </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">otherwise, the clergy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tove </span><span class="font5">the uppermost rooms </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font5">these feasts, and the chief scats in the synagogues, and love to be greeted in the market place and be called by other men, Rabbi (doctor, reverend, or father, or papa] ’. (Matt. 23: 6, 7) Their confederacy goes to the limit, and they come to the end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Today the clergy rely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">upon God and Christ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">depend upon the ‘principal of their flock’ to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">feed </span><span class="font5">them and keep them in the limelight. Concerning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font5">unholy alliance Jehovah says: “The men of thy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">peace </span><span class="font5">(reliance] have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee.” Those ‘seed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Serpent’ may expect that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The Scriptures show that the money-changers become weary listening to and submitting to their so-called “spiritual advisers”, the religionists, and they throw them off, as Napoleon did the clergy of his day, and as the Bolsheviks of Russia did a few years ago. The political and financial men who form the “principal of the flock” well know that the clergy arc hypocrites who claim to be followers of Christ, and yet who organize and carry on persecution against harmless men and women who do the will of God by telling of his name and his kingdom. God by his prophet says, ‘They reach the limit’; and that limit is about at hand.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> For some time political and financial men have furnished the wherewithal to “spread the butter on the bread” for the clergy, in this, that they have held them high up and induct'd the common people to think that they are worth while; and the common people have supported them with their contributions, and the rich have contributed on the theory that the clergy could render them some good. Those same men have sat at the table of the clergy and have fed upon the so-called provender that the clergy provided and handed out to them. To be sure, the Lord foreknew this, and foretold it in those words: “They that eat thy bread ((margin) The men of thy bread] have laid a wound [(A’.F.) a snare] under thee.” Stated in other phrase, for some time the clergy have b<sup>n</sup>en considered an advisable adjunct to big polities and big business, and in turn the big clergy have attempted to supply some kind of so-called “spiritual food” upon which to feed the principal of their flock. But according to the prophecy the time arrives when these “principal of the flock” see the progress of the war between the modern Edomites and the remnant of the Lord, and, clearly discerning the hypocrisy of the Edomites, they say to their erstwhile allies, the clergy: “It is enough. What is the use of having those barnacles hang on to our boat? Let us break them loose and set them adrift.” Corroborating this the prophet of the Lord says: “And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother (providers and nourishers] that begat him «-hall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord (that is to say, you loud, lying fakes, you do not represent God and Christ Jesus] ; and his father and his mother (who have acknowledged and supported the clergy who claim to bo prophets of God] that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesicth. And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.”—Zech. 13:3,6; sec </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, </span><span class="font5">page 252.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> This seems to point to Hie fact that the clergy during the period of war, which is now in progress, will be exposed, disgraced and east aside, and then will follow’ their destruction at Armageddon. In the Devil’s organization affection changes or pretended, feigned affection ceases and the apparently best of friends fall out and fight against each other. As God’s prophet Ezekiel puts it: The “untempered morter” fails to permanently bind them together. (Ez.ek. 13:10-15; 22:28) “Therefore, 0 Aholibah [Jerusalem; professed and hypocritical clergy], thus saith the laird God, Behold, I w’ill raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom ihy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side: They shall nbo strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewel &gt;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.” —Ezek. 23: 22,26, 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The clergy have no understanding of the Word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">God. To them it is ancient history written by old fogies. The clergy have cast the Bible on the side. Although the overwhelming physical facts plainly appearing before the eyes of everyone, together with the Scriptures written for this very time, show clearly that Jehovah’s King is here, the clergy refuse to hear anything about the kingdom of God, and those who tell of God's kingdom are hated and greatly persecuted by the Hierarchy and their allies. Therefore Jehovah by his prophet Obadiah says of the modem Edomites: ‘‘There is none understanding in him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[of it </span><span class="font5">(margin)],” This prophecy is fully corroborated </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">these scriptures following: “They know not, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nei</span><span class="font5">ther will they understand; they walk on in darkness; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the foundations of the earth are out of course.” (Ps. 82:5) “A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.” (1’rov. 18:2) ‘♦‘None of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.”—Dan. 12:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the Itoman Catholic Hierarchy and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">other clergy allied therewith it is written: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“For </span><span class="font5">they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. ” (Deut. 32: 28) Those clergymen are blind guides of the blind, and the ditch of destruction is their end. (Luke 6:39; Matt. 23:24) Only those who now love and serve God will understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLDLY WISE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular, and almost all clergymen in general, are ‘wise in their own conceits’. They do not have the wisdom that is from above, and this is proved by the fact that they do not understand or even study the Word of God. They quote the words of men, citing such as authority for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">expressions of wisdom by which they expect others </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">be guided. They extol one another while they “strut their own stuff”, speaking with high-sounding and meaningless phrase. The Hierarchy in particular speak </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Latin, a language foreign to most people, and especially to Americans. In this way they hope to overawe </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">common people who will look upon them and say: “What a wonderfully wise man that is!” They arc fertile liars and supremo frauds. So wise are they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in their </span><span class="font5">own minds that they arbitrarily tell the people ■what they should and should not hear or read. They substitute their own doctrines for the Word of God. The day must come when God will expose them and then destroy them completely. Therefore says Jehovah by his prophet: “Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?”—Obad. 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its tools are so “self-wise”, and regard themselves as so very important, that they call upon the public rulers, judges of courts, and ofricei'S of the lower rank, and tell such officers what they may or may not do; and up to the present time almost all such officers are fools enough to listen to them. If a radio station is broadcasting some matter<sup>-</sup> of importance to the people, but which is not according to the pleasure of the wise modern Edomites, and which truth so broadcast “shocks their religious susceptibilities”, they immediately wait on the radio manager and demand that programs of such cease, and arrogantly and boldly threaten to destroy the value of the radio station if the expressed wishes of the clergy are not acceded to. The Hierarchy sends its “wise men” and its “silly women” to the merchants and threatens them with boycott, if they dare have about their store anything that is not according to the pleasure of the Hierarchy. At Washington, D.C., the Hierarchy has established itself “high up on a hill”, and issues orders to the daily newspapers, telling them what they shall and what they shall not publish, and such papers as the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> and the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> obey the commands of the Hierarchy. As to political affairs the Hierarchy brintrs into Washington its willing “yes men” from every part of the hind and puts them in political jobs of importance, and key places, like that of “Postmaster General”, and issues orders as to what shall be done in the political affairs of the nation. The foolish “Protestant” clergy, so called, fall right, in with the Hierarchy, and the Jewish rabbis do likewise, and al!of them look upon the Hierarchy as holding in its ranks the wise men of the world who must be obeyed. Now the Lord has caused a work to begin and to progress, which is uncovering the crookedness of the modern-day Edomites. The preaching of the Scriptures to the people reveals to them that the Hierarchy and allies possess no wisdom from the Lord, but that they have the wisdom of this world, which is devilish and injurious to those who desire righteousness. The war against that wicked crowd now progresses and proves to honest people, in the light of prophecies, .hat within a short time the modern Edomites will be completely exposed and their bluff and bluster will come to an end. Even now many of the commercial men and politicians clearly discern the hypocrisy of the so-eallcd “wise men” of the clergy who attempt to give spiritual advice to others. The common people are seeing as never before, and are discerning, that the clergy are cither willingly or unwillingly ignorant of the Word of God and hence are unsafe advisers. The entrenched lies and hypocrisy of the clergy will be completely uncovered and exposed to public gaze to their own confusion. We know this is true, because Jehovah God so states. (Isa. 28:17) Concerning the clergy, the modern-day Edomites, Jehovah savs- “For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. And the vision of ali is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed.”—Isa. 29:10,11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Because the clergy have only the wisdom of this world they have no understanding of the Word of God, and concerning them it is written: ‘‘For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, lie taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.” (1 Cor. 3:19, 20) ‘‘For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?” (1 Cor. 1:19,20) Furthermore says Jehovah: ‘‘I am the Lord, that makcth all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; that frustrated: the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and makcth their knowledge foolish.”—Isa. 44:24,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> When will the Lord bring upon the modern Edomites the calamities mentioned? He says, ‘‘In that day,” that is, the day of Jehovah, when he, rises up in judgment for the deliverance of his own, and particularly for the vindication of his own name. The Devil has used his worldly-wise clergy for many years to defame the name of Jehovah, and now the day of the Lord has come when he will bring them all to a fearful account. The Scriptures seem clearly to teach that after the Lord has torn off the mask now worn by the hypocritical clergy, the Hierarchy and others, and behind which they have hidden to carry on their crookedness, and after he has exposed them to public contempt and disgrace, then he will literally destroy them. They had the opportunity to know God and to embrace the birthright of the Abrahamie promise, but, like their ancestor Esau of old, they regarded the birthright as of no value, and hence they threw it aside. They have gathered together great crowds of gullible persons, deceived them, and wrung from them support for themselves. They have assumed the positions of shepherds of the flock for the common people, but not for the benefit of the flock, but, on the contrary, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">clergy might feed and clothe themselves and live wantonly. Knowing their crookedness the Lord caused his prophet to say concerning them: ‘‘Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock. . . . But with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.”—Lzek. 34: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Not only have the clergy failed to feed the hungry souls upon the truth of God’s Word, but they have used all their power and influence to prevent the flock from receiving nourishment at the hands of those who really serve God. Therefore to the modern Edomites, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergy, Jehovah says: “Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet ? And as for my flock, they cat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.” (Ezek. 34:18,19) The judgment of the Lord God written concerning those false shepherds, the modern Edomites, is that their destruction is certain, and they shall find no way of escape. ‘‘Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.” (Jcr. 25:34,35) The wisdom of Satan, together with the wise men of this world, shall perish for ever, and the name of Jehovah God shall be exalted for ever.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Tcman was a prominent stronghold of the ancient Edomites, and therefore pictures the prominent clergymen strong in power of the church organizations, foremost in the religious organizations wilii the political officers of the world, and these in the Scriptures are ironically called ‘‘mighty men”; and concerning them the Lord, by the prophet, says: ‘‘And thy mighty men, 0 Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of tiie mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.” (Obad. 9) It is appropriate here that notice be taken of the fact that the three religious hypocrites, or frauds, appeared to suffering Job on the pretext of giving him comfort, but in fact to torment Job, the latter being faithful to Jehovah God. Eliphaz took the leading part in chastising Job with ironical words of pity, and Eliphaz was a Temanite. (Job 2:11) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy takes the lead in ridiculing and persecuting and tormenting Jehovah’s faithful remnant and therefore is well foreshadowed by Eliphaz, and the other clergymen of ‘‘organized religion” trail along and do as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy leaders do. The ‘‘mighty men”, the Temanites, are specifically the Roman Catholic clergy, and those Jehovah particularly declares shall be dismayed and cut off.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” What will dismay those worldly-wise Edomites of the modern day? In a scornful manner and with boastful words they say: ‘We are safe and secure behind our mountain of lies; the scourge shall not come nigh us; who can find us out?’ And Jehovah says: ‘The truth shall sweep away those lies and expose to view the hypocrisy of the fertile liars.’ That now jars the ‘‘wise” Temanites somewhat, even to hear it at the mouth of Jehovah’s witnesses. It will jar them more in the Lord’s due time. The Lord says he will put it in the heart of the rulers, the kings of this world, to strip the old ‘‘whore” naked and apply the branding iron, and that will dismay them some more and bring them into complete contempt and shame. “The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them ?” (Jer. 8: 9) These tilings are now made known to Jehovah’s witnesses who are in the war, and God gives them this information as he pleases, that they might with patience and comfort of heart, and with strong hope, continue to push the fight against the enemy by declaring the message of God's Yv'ord with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. In doing this work the faithful remnant will not permit themselves to be adversely influenced by that other class of self-constituted “wise ones” who assume to tell the Lord that the great multitude will be gathered after what is unwisely called “the first phase of Armageddon”. Such presumptuous speech before the people of God tends to defile the temple of God when spoken by one who claims to be of the temple. Manifestly the apostle had such in mind when he wrote these words: “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of Goel is holy, which temple ye are. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you scemeth to Ise wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.” (1 Cor. 3:17,18) Those who have ‘the wisdom that cometh down from above’ will .stand shoulder to shoulder now in the fight for the kingdom gospel, being careful to obey the Lord's commandments and not to try to appear wise in the eyes of others by advancing some fanciful theory buildul on credulity and not -upon faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Why is Jehovah now using the remnant to proclaim the truth concerning the modern-day Edomites? The answer is, that the hiding place of lies, which the Hierarchy has builded up, may be made manifest and exposed to view. Everything ecclesiastical, and which is therefore hypocritical and religious, Jehovah declares he will expose and then destroy utterly: “A sword [Jehovah's sword of execution, which is preceded by his Word, at the mouth of his witnesses] is upon the liars; and they shall dote [be foolish; do foolishly] ; a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.” (Jer. 50:36) “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off mail and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.” (Ezek. 25:13) ’And the shepherds [modern Edomites] shall have no way of escape.’ (Jer. 25:35) The lime will come, the Scriptures declare, when these worldly-wise modern-day Edomites will boastingly and arrogantly say: ‘We are in peace and safety’; and ‘then sudden destruction shall come upon them as travail upon a woman’. —1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REASON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Why will Jehovah humiliate and disgrace the modern Edomites, the Hierarchy and their allies, and then completely destroy them? By his prophet he answers: “For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut oil for ever.” (Verse 10) Hepeatedlv Esau showed violence toward.his brother Jacob. From the time that Esau lost his birthright and from the time Jacob received the blessing, Esau persecuted Jacob. “And Esau hated Jacob became of the blessing wherewith his father blci ted him; and I'Xm said m ins heart, The daws of mourning for my fattier arc at hand, (hen will I slay my brother Jacob.”—Gen. 27: -11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The Scriptures show that he continued to persecute Jacob; and this applies both to Esau and to the ones whom Esau foreshadowed. (Pss. 83:6; 137:7; Ezek. 35: 6-9,14,15) From the time that the modern-day Edomites, the clergy, discerned that God’s favor was upon his faithful witnesses, and particularly Ike remnant since the year 1918, those clergymen June put forth their best endeavors to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, the antitypical Jacob class. Particularly the Homan Catholic Hierarchy has manifested its enmity against Jelioiah’s witnesses and the truth as told by those witnesses has exposed the crookedness of the Homan Catholic Hierarchy, particularly since 1918. The clergy have murder in their hearts against the faithful witnesses of the Lord. During the World War those clergymen met at Philadelphia to further work out their conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses. They framed a case against some of those witnesses, and by fraud, deceit, lies and the connivance of crooked men in official positions, railroaded some of Jehovah’s witncs is to the penitentiary, and then tried to prevent an appeal of those cases to the higher courts. Later, v.hcn the Supreme Court of the I’nited States got to these cases, Jehovah’s witnesses were immediately released from prison and admitted to bail, and th&lt;* government dismissed the cases, and the judgment of the lower court was completely set aside. Now the cowardly Hierarchy and their newspapers falsely publish as fact that these men are ex-convicts, well knowing that such a .statement is a deliberate lie. A man is not a convict until a judgment is final against him. They have not the courage to come into the open and fight and answer the Scriptural charges against thei i, but strike in the dark and thus attempt to poison the minds of their parishioners to prevent them from hearing the kingdom message of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> These wicked clergymen, failing in their efforts to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses during the excitement of the World War, have constantly persecuted the faithful remnant since that time. The modern-day Edomites seem to have no conception or understanding that they arc fighting against God and his King. Like the Pharisees of old, those clergymen of the present day have turned themselves wholly to Caesar and recognize none other as their king. Their persecution of the faithful witnesses of the Lord is, as Jesus states, a persecution of himself, and the Lord v ill not permit such wickedness to pass unnoticed.—Matt. 25:32-46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Jehovah has declared his purpose to humiliate those wicked persecutors by causing his witnesses to proclaim his message of truth throughout the world, and in obedience to his commandment the witnesses are now doing that very thing. The truth vexes the Hierarchy and puts its men to shame. “Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; let them return and be ashamed suddenly.’’ (Ps. 6:10) “Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt; let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me. Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.” (Ps. 35:26,4) Those who really love and serve God will not be ashamed. They will look the enemy square in the face and tell them the truth. “Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed; let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.” (Ps. 25:3) “Let me not be ashamed, 0 Lord; for I have called upon thee; let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. Let the lying lips be put to silence, which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.”—Ps. 31:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> That Jehovah’s witnesses may be assured and comforted and continue, to pursue with patience their warfare against the modern Edomites, the Lord continues to pour into their minds his expressed purpose to destroy those who have defamed his name. To th&quot; modern-day Edomites the Lord says: “And thou shall be cut off for ever.” Furthermore God calls these hypocritical, persecuting clergy “the people of my curse”. (Isa. 34: 5) And no wonder; for their wickedness is brought to mind. Those self-worldly-wise ones, who claim to be the special representatives of God and the recipients of his blessings, who claim to rule in the name and stead of Christ Jesus, Jehovah condemns, and says: ‘You shall be cut off for ever.’ The modernday Edomites have called themselves “nobles”, and are looked upon by their allies as nobles. They have made believe that they arc the possessors of the high places in the kingdom of God, but, says the Lord to them, “they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.” (Isa. 34:12) “Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever; but I will send a fire upon Toman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.”—Amos 1:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> God’s Word is that the Edomites shall share the same fate as Babylon, which shall be cut off permanently. (Mal. 1: 4) Perpetual hatred of and malicious persecution against the faithful servants of God and Christ is a “sin unto death”. The Lord declares that those evil persecutors who thus sin are “goats” and that these shall go away into everlasting cutting off. (Matt, 25: 46, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.')</span><span class="font5"> The clergy have maliciously and wickedly persecuted God’s faithful witnesses, and still do so. “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, . . . ? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. ’ ’—Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANTI-KINGDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has always been against the kingdom of God, while hypocritically and falsely claiming to rule by divine right and authority. In recent years “Protestant” clergymen, so called, have gone completely over to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and now all are in the same bag. During the World War practically all these clergymen took sides against the kingdom of God, refused to hear Ihe testimony that the Lord had returned and that his kingdom is at hand, and joined in cruelly persecuting tho*-e who proclaim such trutiis of the Lord. To that antikingdom clergy crowd, the Lord says: “In the day [particularly in 1917 and 1918, when the clergy sought to have enacted an espionage law by which Jehovah’s witnesses might be destroyed] that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.”—Obad. 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> There is but one right side, and, in the language of the scripture, “the other side” is anti-kingdom-of-G'od, and it is on this “other side”, or the antikingdom side, that the modern Edomites stand and have for a long while stood. It was the clergymen who were on the war draft boards that urged the rigid enforcement of the conscription law against Jehovah's witnesses, and did that in utter disregard of their conscientious objection and their privileges as provided by that law. The clergy induced the government to rule that Jehovah’s witnesses could not take advantage of the “conscientious scruple proviso of that draft law” because tiicy were not “a recognized religious organization”. It was the clergy who insisted on the wrongful enforcement of the espionage law against God’s faithful people because those faithful ones were, telling the truth of and concerning the kingdom of God. Those same persecutors attempted to compel God’s faithful witnesses to take an active part in the mortal combat, and caused those who refused to do so to be cruelly punished. It was the clergy who brought about the imprisonment of many of the faithful witnesses of the Lord, and when those faithful followers of Christ Jesus were confined in prison, and when the war had ended, the clergy did not ask amnesty in behalf of God's servants, but, on the contrary, sought to hold those faithful servants of the Lord in pri-oii that they might die there. The clergy were the chief ones who indulged in the slaving of God’s faithful witness Antipas. (Rev. 2:13 ; 11: 7) The modern-day Edomites, who collectively make up the old “whole”, gleefully ‘rode on the back of the scarlet-colored beast that bore her up —Rev, 17: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•“During the World War “strangers”, or aliens from God and his kingdom, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">put </span><span class="font5">the Lord’s faithful ►servants under restraint, many of them behind prison bars, banned the published message of the Lord, and relentlessly persecuted the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Those “foreigners”, particularly the Roman Catholic clergy and their allies, unknown to God and his kingdom, effectuallj' stopped up the gates or ways that Jehovah’s servants entered </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">render praise unto the Lord, and they reduced the companies of God’s faithful people to the despicable level of that which results from a game of chance. They belittled, profaned and ridiculed God’s earthly organization and made it appear that God could </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">furnish protection for his people. In carrying on this wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by public officials the clergy urged it be done, and stood with those more actively engaged as spoilers; and concerning the. clergymen the Lord says: “Even thou wast as one of them.” The clergy hypocritically posed as the representatives of the Lord and as the spiritual advisers of the “strangers” or “foreigners”, who actually imprisoned Jehovah’s faithful servants. They conspired, and connived at and urged the committing of all the cruel atrocities against those who serve God and his kingdom; and now the Lord tells them, his witnesses, to make known his purpose to mete out to his enemies a just recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’’For many years the modern Edomites, the Hierarchy and their allied clergy, have nursed a burning hatred of God’s faithful servants, and the coming of the World War opened to them the way for them to gratify their wicked spleen. They looked with keen satisfaction upon the day when apparent disaster camo upon the faithful preachers of God’s Word of truth, and now the Lord by his prophet says to that wicked, hypocritical Hierarchy crowd: “But thou shouldcst not have looked on the day of tliy brother' in the day that he became a stranger [in the day of his disaster (R.y.)]; neither shouldcst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldcst thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.”—Ohad. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*’ The “evil servant” class connived with the Hierarchy and the other clergy in bringing about the apparent disaster upon Jehovah’s witnesses. So satisfied were they with the punishment that befell the faithful servants of God that they laughed with glee. When once, these faithful servants of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Lord were imprisoned the clergy spoke not one kind word to them or about them, giving them not even a cup of water to drink or any other means of comfort, but, on the contrary, gloated over them in an arrogant and insolent manner, as the billy goat does over his vanquished foe. The clergy rejoiced together that the faithful servants of God were thrown into prison, even as the Lord foretold they would do: “And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an-half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.”—Rev. 11: 9,10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> When the clergy saw the faithful servants of God in distress they laughed at their misery and said to each other: “We did it, and now we arc rid of that pestiferous crowd that interfered with us.” The Lord by his prophet says to them: “Neither shouldcst thou have magnified thy mouth [enlarged thy mouth in a laugh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Jtoth.,</span><span class="font5"> margin)] in the day of [their] distress.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Those in that day known as the “Bible Students”, and who were the faithful servants of God, were the only ones during that period of the World War that firmly and steadfastly stood by the organization of God and his Word; and because of their faithfulness in so doing they were persecuted and punished at the instance of the clergy, who took great delight therein, and the clergy thereby showed themselves to be enemies of God and his people, and against his kingdom. Foreknowing this, the Lord caused his faithful prophet to write these words: “Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?” (Ps. 41:5) “For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, saj ing, God hath forsaken him; persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.” (Ps. 71:10^11) “But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; yea, Ihc objects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not; with hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha! our eye hath seen it.” (Ps. 35:15,16,21) “They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.”—Ps. 22:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Those clergymen have wickedly blasphemed the name of God. hypocritically claiming to be his representatives, and at the same time have rejoiced over the calamity of “Jerusalem” (that is, God's organization on earth) and “Judah” (the people who praise and serve Jehovah), and therefore Jehovah says to them: “Because thou hast said, These two nations, and these two countries, shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Lord was there: . . . thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they arc given us to consume. Thus with your mouth ye have boasled against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.”—Ezck. 35:10,12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> Furthermore the Lord takes the modern Edomites to task for their wicked conduct and says to them: “Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the daj' of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.”—Obad. 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> The clergy connived at and worked with others of Satan’s organization to bring suffering upon the true people of God during the World War period, and ever since that day they have continued to do so. The clergy have not even kept aloof as neutral, but, instead, they have been active enemies of God and his people. They have sought gain out of the, calamities that fell upon God’s faithful servants and have tried to get them out of the way so that the future work of the clergy in collecting money from the people upon false pretenses might not be hindered. Cruel selfishness has moved the clergy, and so now moves them, in every part of the earth in their attempt to prevent Jehovah's witnesses from proclaiming the truth, in order that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clerry may have some personal selfish profit by further playing upon the credulities of the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy have banded together with others of Satan's repie-sentatives and maliciously demand the annihilation of Jehovah’s witnesses, and to them Jehovah says: “Neither’ shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font5"> those of his that did escape , neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.’’—Obad. 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> God did not commission Edom to punish his chosen people, nor has he commissioned Ihe clergy to punish his faithful servants now on the earth. During Ihe World War the clergy secured exemption from military service of all whom they desired, but. on the contrary, they asked for the destruction of Jehovah’s servant class, who were real conscientious objectors against breaking the everlasting covenant. Concerning these faithful ones of the Lord the clergy said: “.Make them come in line with the government [Babylon], and if they refuse, the firing squad for them.’’ Their father the Devil put it into their mind to completely rid the earth of those who completely served God and his kingdom. The day of reckoning must come and the clergy will be brought to full account, as the Lord declares.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The judgment day of the Lord, and the terror to the wicked that accompanies it, is at hand, and to the modern Edomites Jehovah now says: “For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen; as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy reward shall return upon thine own head.”—Obad. 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> “Organized religion” should not expect to be protected or find a way of escape when the Lord's wrath is expressed. Organized religion is truly heathen, because it is against God and his King and those who truly worship the Most High. All nations and peoples that are anti-kingdom of God are included in the foregoing words of Jehovah’s prophet, and this is confirmed by the words of the Lord from another prophet, to wit: “For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies; he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and ths* mountains shall be melted with their blood. And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree. For my sword shall be bathed in heaven ; behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. The sword of the Lord is filled with bloo 1; it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lamb-, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.”—Isa. 34:2-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> During the World War the modern Edomites, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and others compelled God’s faithful people to drink<sup>-</sup> the cup of bitterness, and the day of retribution must come upon those Edomites, and is near at hand; and therefore the Lord says to them: “For thus saith the Lord, Behold, they [God’s faithful servants] whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken [by compulsion at the hands of the Edomites] ; and art Hum [modern-day Edomites] he that shall altogether sro unpunished? thou shall not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.”—Jer. 49: 12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Edom is specifically named to receive of the wrath of God. It is the duty of Jehovah’s witnesses to now ‘declare the day of the vengeance of our God' avail.st the modern Edomites: “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I s&lt; nd thee to drink it. . . . Edom . . . and all the kingdoms of the world, which arc upon the face of the earth: . . . And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ye shall certainly drink.”— Jer. 25:15-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Retribution shall come upon the modern Edomites, because God has so declared unto them : “As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee.” Jehovah of hosts will see to it that it is done, and he declares he will put it into the heart and mind of the “ten horns” and the “beast” to have part in the execution and the burning of the old “whore”.—Rev. 17 : 1G, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Jehovah emphatically states that he will do it. “Because thou hast said, These two nations, and the,&quot; two countries, shall be mine, and we will pos-e-s it ; whereas the Lord was there: . . . thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all thy bla,-phemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate, 0 mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 35:10,12,15) The beastly rulers that have been in an alliance with the clergy, and who have eaten the clergy’s fodder, will have part in inflicting retributive justice, which shall and must come upon the Hierarchy and their allied clergy.— Obad. 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> Jehovah can prevent the clergy from inflicting punishment upon his people, even as he could have prevented the Devil from persecuting his beloved Son Christ Jesus, but Jehovah has given the Devil and his seed all the rope they want. But the end thereof must be reached, and that end has now come, and they shall have some of their own medicine, as Obadiah says: “Thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Jesus announced the unchangeable rule of Jehovah,, to wit: ‘‘For with what judgment ye judge, yc shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”—Matt. 7: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> To be sure, Jehovah needs no creature to give a hand in the destruction of the enemy clergy, but he expresses his purpose to give his people a share in that work: ‘‘Thus saith the Lord God, Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatl.y offended, and revenged himself upon them; therefore thus saith the Lord God, I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Tcman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel [the Head and Prince of which is Christ Jesus, the Executioner] ; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger, and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 25:12-14) At the present time Jehovah’s witnesses on earth are vigorously engaged in their part of the warfare by proclaiming the truth, which includes the ‘‘vengeance of our God”, and are making known to the people that Jehovah’s day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4T</sup> While there is no directly divine record that the Edomites were on Mount Zion, yet it can be inferred from the psalmist that they stood on the east side of the brook Kidron looking toward Mount Zion, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font5">maudlin, drunken manner cried out, as Jerusalem was attacked: ‘‘Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.” (Ps. 137:7) It is certain that the Edomites, when they saw the Israelites in distress, indulged in a drunken feast because thereof; so Jehovah says to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, the Edomites of the present time: “For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(Roth.,</span><span class="font5"> margin) round about], yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. ” (Obad. 16) This last drunkenness of the modern Edomites will not be with jubilation and pleasure, but will be an effort to drown their chagrin, shame and disgrace. “Yea, they shall drink,” until they are beastly drunk, and what they shall drink is far worse than the Prohibition “hooch” formerly used in America, because they will drink themselves to death: “For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.” (Ps. 75:8) According to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font5"> “Yea, they shall drink and swallow down </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font5"> stagger, reel]”; “they shall . . . talk foolishly” (7LF., margin), thus losing their balance, reason and self-control, in their drunken efforts to make believe that they are cheerful and optimistic. That drunken brawl will witness the passing of the Edomites, for, says the prophet of Jehovah, “they shall be as though they had not been,” and those who survive that day will put the Hierarchy and their allies for ever out of memory. It is Jehovah God who is now maneuvering the enemy, and who will hand them a cup and compel them to drink it. It is a picture of their destruction. It is God’s work, and it will seem very strange to them and to others, because they have, for many years, hypocritically deceived honest people and made them believe that they arc the representatives of God and Christ, when in fact they have been representatives of the Devil all the time. Jehovah has caused many pictures to be recorded concerning the destruction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied religionists, and Obadiah’s prophecy is but one of them. All those prophetic pictures show one thing, to wit, the complete destruction of the hypocritical religionists, who have blinded the people and defamed God’s holy name; and even they shall know that Jehovah is the Almighty God when their end comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The organized religionists are now being exposed by the proclamation of the kingdom message, and this is the part in the war that is performed by Jehovah’s witnesses in advance of the destruction of the Edomites; and Jehovah shows it now to his covenant people, and this he does for their comfort, that they may be fully assured and have strong hope. Those who will profit by this information will be the ones who appreciate the goodness of Jehovah and who “fear his name” and who fear not man nor devil. Let the fate of the Edomites be a warning to them that put a stumblingblock in the way of their brethren. Jehovah makes it clear that he will permit no creature to interfere with his work. Those who attempt to do so will come to grief. The faithful may expect no favor, protection or salvation from men or man-made organizations, and they will not look for such. Those who love God and his kingdom will look to the Most High for salvation through Christ Jesus. Even after the fall of the Edomites no favor will be received by Jehovah’s witnesses from the rulers of this world. It is war to the bitter end, and God through Christ Jesus will deliver those who love and serve him.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>WHEN ALL SHALL KNOW JEHOVAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">K</span><span class="font5">NOWLEDGE of God has been sought bj’ many honest-hearted persons in all times past. The time is now come, according to the prophecy of the Scriptures, when all shall know Jehovah, the eternal God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among all the benefits that men will receive under the righteous government of Christ Jesus the greatest will be to know God. He is the everlasting One, who created heaven and earth and all things therein. No human eye will ever sec God, but all human intelligent creatures will have an opportunity to discern him and his loving-kindness. When that great truth is fully realized by man, then he will understand why God at stated intervals has made his name prominent before his creatures. It is written: “For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. ” (Isa. 11:9) How will the knowledge of God result beneficially to man? It was Jesus who answered that question: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That which man desires above all things else is that he might have life in happiness. God created man and gave him life, and no creature can with propriety take away life without God’s consent. It follows that no man or other creature could have eternal life without the consent of Jehovah God. To know God, therefore, means to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people must come to a knowledge of the f.ict that God is love. That means that he is so unselfish and that his desire to bless man is so great that he gave his dearly beloved Son to die and raised him out of death that man might get life. (John 3:16; 10:10) Surely when man learns that great truth he will have gratitude towards God. They will learn that Jehovah is their true friend because he has loved them all the time even while they were his enemies. (J’rov. 17:17) Satan Ihe enemy being removed, the profile will travel unhindered the great highway that leads to life, giving unstinted praise to Jehovah. As they progress under the just and righteous government of the Lord their knowledge of the loving-kindness and the glory of God will increase. All those who then willingly obey him and walk in the way of righteousness shall live for ever and never die.—John 8:51; 11: 2G; Ezek. 18:27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the enemies from which man has long suffered are these: fraud, deception, exploitation, extortion, robbery, and war. l\lan has suffered at the hands of boodlers, grafters, and oppressors. He has suffered because of famine, pestilence, sickness and death. All these enemies G'od will destroy through Christ during the operation of his righteous government. “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under hi&lt; feet The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death ”—. 1 Cor. 15:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sorrow and pain shall pass away and there shall be no more death. (Rev. 21:4-6) The people will learn that God in his loving-kindness has bestowed all these benefits upon them. They will then come to a full realization that among all the benefits received the crowning one is to know Jehovah God. They will know that God redeemed man and set up a righteous government for man. The people will then enjoy everlasting peace; they will be secure from all evil; they will have no fear of any enemy, because there will be none. They will have full confidence that their general welfare will lx; safeguarded by the great King. They will enjoy an abundance of food and raiment, and truth will be their portion. They will have health and strength and life. They will stand upon the earth in the image and likeness of their great Creator, and their prayers of thanksgiving will ever ascend unto him. They will delight themselves in the Lord God and express their hearts’ sentiments to him. The prophet of the Lord foresaw that happy day and for the benefit of the people wrote: “I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless.thy name for ever and ever. Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. ... I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. . . . All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the gloiious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. . . . Thou opencst thine hand, and satisficst the desire of every living thing. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holv in all his works.” —Ps. 145:1-17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah manifests his loving-kindness toward man in many wa&gt;s, that man might learn his purpose and know him. lie uses visible parts of his creation to picture that .which is invisible to man. In his Word he uses a ‘‘mountain” TO picture n governmental organization. A great mountain usually has a small summit or peak which is the highest part or crown of the mountain. That part is the most conspicuous and is called a ‘‘hill ”, or the highest elevation of the mountain range. Mount Zion is a symbol of God’s government ; and the highest and most conspicuous part of his government is the Governor, his beloved Son. Therefore it is written: ‘‘Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) “His foundation is in the holy mountains.”—Ps. 87:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He speaks of Mount Zion as his dwelling place: “Mount Zion, wherein thou didst take up thy habitation.” (Ps. 74:2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “In Judah is God' known; his name is great in Israel. In .Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwellingplace in Zion.” (Ps. 76:1,2) “For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.”—Ps. 132:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the progressive steps in preparing for his gov</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ernment for man God caused many events to take place in a mountain. Isaac was offered up as a sacrifice in Mount Moriah, ‘the mountain of the Lord.’ (Gen. 22:1-14) “Moriah” means “the bitterness of the Lord”. It was in that same mountain, but outside the city wall, that Jesus, whom Isaac foreshadowed, was sacrificed; and it seems to say: ‘Through much tribulation or bitterness is the v/ay into the kingdom. (Acts 14:22) “Moriah” also means “fear of the Lord”; and such fear is peculiar to the kingdom class, because they fear only Jehovah. (Isa. 8:13) Abraham called the place where Isaac was offered “Jchovah-jireh”, which means “chosen, or seen, of the Lord”. There Solomon Ixigan the building of the temple. Since a “mountain” is a symbol of God’s organization, the facts show that the sacrifice of Jesus was carried out in God’s organization preparatory for the kingdom of God, and this is supported by the apostle's words: “If wc suffer, we shall also reign with him.” —2 Tim. 2:12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses, the prophet who foreshadowed Christ, die.l according to God’s orders on Mount Nebo, which name means “that which sneaks or prophesies”, (l)eut. 32: 49, 50) Moses prophesied that Jehovah would raise up One of whom Moses was the t&gt; pc and that he should be the great Ruler of the world.—-Ilcut. 18: 15, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aaron foreshadowed the priesthood of Jehovah. It was ordered by Jehovah that Aaron should die on a mountain top; which he did. (Num. 20:28; 33: 38,39) Tho«e pictures made by order or command of Jehovah seem to say: ‘The “royal priesthood” must die while members of God’s organization and be exalted in his organization. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Moses was tending the flocks of his father-inlaw Jethro, he “came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb”. God told Moses that his chosen people Israel should be brought forth from Egypt (symbolizing Satan’s organization) and that they should worship and serve God “upon this mountain”. (Ex. 3:1,12) That this mountain is used to picture the setting up of God’s government or kingdom is definitely stated bj’ the apostle Paul.—Heb. 12:24-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God had led the Israelites safely across the Red sea by the hand of Moses his servant, Moses composed and sang unto the Lord a song which is a prophecy, wherein it is stated that God would “plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, ... in the sanctuary” which God has established.. (Ex. 15:1,17) “And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.”—Ps. 78: 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus took three of his zealous and faithful disciples and “bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, and was [there] transfigured before them”. (Matt. 17:1, 2) A few days prior thereto Jesus, while speaking to his disciples of his coming in his glory to set up his kingdom, said: “There be some standing here which shall not taste of death, till thev see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” (Matt. 16:28) At this present time there is upon the earth a small “remnant” the members of which are zealous and faithful followers of the Lord and who are, by his grace, giving witness concerning the Lord’s kingdom. This remnant believes on the Lord through the teachings of the apostles. In that prophetic picture in the mountain of transfiguration the three faithful disciples represented someone. Is it not reasonable to say that they represented the faithful remnant who have not tasted death but who have intelligently and understandingly seen the proof of the end of Satan’s world, and vlio see Christ, God’s great King, seated upon the throne of his kingdom? Those who will continue faithful from now on to the end must of necessity be of the remnant and will inherit the kingdom. God caused his prophet to write: “Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all. And I will bring forth a seed Ithe remnant of the seedl out of Jacob, and out of Judah., [the royal house] an inheritor of my mountains [Jiiirh places in the government]: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.Isa. 65:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Look upon the mountains. Jehovah God made them. Their foundations are unshakable, except by the power of Almighty God. Their lofty heads tower above the clouds. The storms rage, the fires of lightning flash and burn, and the mighty waves of the sea dash against them; yet they arc unmoved and undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Serenely and peacefully there they stand. They have thus stood since Jehovah made them, and will stand for ever. The lofty mountain peak pictures the great government of Jehovah God and his Christ. As the storms and floods do not shake the mountains, even so all the storms and floods of opposition that now rage or that might come shall never<sup>-</sup> disturb or shake God’s righteous government. “The floods have lifted up, 0 Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is mightier than the noise [discordant propaganda and speech made in opposition to his kingdom] of many waters [tire peoples that oppose], yea, than the mighty waves [the great breakers, mighty opponents] of the sea.” —Ps. 93: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While Satan, that old Dragon, the Devil, and his organization now desperately attempt to destroy the remnant, these need not fear, but may firmly stand in confidence and in security, knowing that as long as they “have the testimony of Jesus Christ” and “keep the commandments of God” they shall be as secure as the mountains. Jerusalem is a picture of the people of God. Zion pictures or represents particularly the faithful remnant. To them Jehovah says: “They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. As the mountains arc round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.” (Ps. 125:1,2) Thus God speaks to his people of their absolute security as long as they dwell in the secret place of the Most High. There no evil shall befall them.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>HUMAN SUFFERING TO BE ENDED: HOW</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S every act toward the first man Adam was marked with goodness. By the manifestation of his loving-kindness he would show man the blessings resulting from goodness. He made Adam perfect in body and mind, and clothed him with authority as prince of all the earth’s creation. He caused the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air to appear before Adam, that they might be named by him and receive his commandments; and they did appear and obeyed him. He made for Adam a perfect home, and supplied it with every need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, as a climax of the exhibition of his loving consideration for Adam, he created for him a perfect companion, the most beautiful thing that Adam’s eyes had ever beheld aside from his own image. She was a joy to his heart, and he had pleasure with her. They gathered fruits and flowers and feasted upon them, while they sat upon the banks of the beautiful rivers and listened to the laughter of the gentle waves as they kissed the verdure-lined banks and hurried on again. They walked midst the trees, and were entertained by the sweet song of the feathered tribes. Hand in hand, and with royal stride, they climbed the mountain tops and delighted their souls in gazing upon the rolling hills, the majestic mountains, the beautiful valleys, the peaceful rivers, and the waving forests of evergreen and fruit-bearing trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A perfect man and a perfect woman in a perfect home, with vigor, strength and perfect health and life, what more could heart desire ? All these things Jehovah had provided for them, and they were the expression of God’s loving-kindness. Because God had told Adam, he would tell his wife of their rights and privileges in that Eden. Something to this effect he would say to her: ‘Eve, all these wonderful and beautiful things are ours, because God our Creator and Father has given them to us. Of every tree of this marvelous garden it is our privilege to cat, except of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; and God has said that in the day we eat thereof, dying wc shall die. But as long as we are obedient to our Father all these wonders and beauties are ours, for our pleasure; and he has commanded that we shall bring forth children and make this earth a glorious place for all of us to dwell in. ’ Everything that Adam and Eve had came from God. He was their Life-giver, therefore their Father. Now as prince and princess of earth they must be put to a test, that they might prove theii' appreciation of God's loving-kindness and be always in harmony with him. &quot;Why should they not love God and obey him? He was their true and loving Friend. If they should lack appreciation of his goodness they would not be a pleasure to their Maker. God would not compel them to obey, but he would afford an opportunity for them to prove their Jove for him; and this they would prove by being obedient to him. It was but a small thing to i sk them to do. It meant the loss of everything to them to refuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eve yielded to the seductive and fraudulent representations of Lucifer, who was their invisible overlord in the garden of Eden, and she disobeyed God. Adam was not deceived as she had been. (1 Tim. 2:14) He loved self more than he loved God. He desired to gratify self by going in the way with Eve rather than to obey God and be deprived of her. Here God began to teach man that love is the only motive that leads to happine-s. Because Eve was a part of Adam she shared in the sentence of death that, came upon him. (Rom. 5;12) Because of their disobedience to God this perfect pair were deprived of their beautiful home; and they went forth to labor in the sweat of face and to suffer and finally to die. Over a long period of time they passed through this terrible experience, and then they returned to the dust from which they were. made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’While Adam and Eve were passing through sorrow and suffering their children were brought forth, and the.y in turn suffered. But why should their children and their children’s children throughout the ages be compelled to suffer from the effects of the evil-doing of their parents? Were these children in any way responsible for the wrongful acts of their parents? No, because they were not in existence at the time the wrongful deed was committed; but the effect of that wrong was visited upon them; and the fact that it was so done shows forth the wisdom of Jehovah God. The provision which God made in their behalf showed not only his wisdom, but his love for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The provision God made was that the outworking of his purpose would provide redemption for man, and that in due time God would grant man an opportunity to gain life. This provision for redemption was through the voluntary and sacrificial death of the perfect One whom he would provide. Suppose, then, that each one of Adam's children had been born perfect, and had not received the results of their parents’ sins; then each one must in turn be put under test as to whether he would obey or disobey God. Some might have obeyed and lived; but every one who violated God's law must go for ever into death, unless provision were made for his redemption. If redemption was provided, then a separate ransom would have been required for each and every one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God in his wisdom and loving-kindness caused all men to be embraced, included or shut up, in Adam’s condemnation because of sin, in order that by and through one perfect sacrifice redemption could be provided for all. The record states that such was his arrangement. (Gal. 3:22) Permitting then the children of Adam to be born in sin and shapen in iniquity was again an exercise of God’s loving-kindness toward them, because opportunity for redemption shall come to all of them through the one great sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the human race sprang from Adam, and all have been born imperfect because of sin. (Ps. 51:5) Throughout the ages God has been bringing to the attention of some the fact that to serve and obey him, the righteous One, leads to life. Tin sc in turn, acting as God's witnesses, have taught the lesson 1o others; and in God’s due time all shall be brought to a knowledge of this great truth. (Isa. 11:9) Then all will know that God is loving and kind, and that everything out of harmony with him is wrong and evil, and that therefore he who would live in peace and happiness must be in harmony with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unless all men had been embraced in this condemnation of Adam, resulting from sin, the sacrifice of Jesus could not have availed for all. The fact that all were embraeid under it opens the way, through one sacrifice, that all may have an opport unity to live. To this effect it is written: “Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came ' upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” —Horn. 5:18,19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now God’s due time is at hand when all men shall be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth, and shall learn that God, in his loving-kindnes&gt;, long ago made provision that through the death of Christ Jesus all men shall have an opportunity' to live.— John 17:23; 1:9; 1 John 4:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah in his wisdom and loving-kindness not only provided a “ransom for all”, but provided that the One who would be willingly' obedient unto death in order to provide such ransom should be exalted to the highest place in the universe and be granted the prize of inherent life, be made his Executive Officer and instrument to bless all the families of the earth. His beloved Son won that great prize. God’s purpose also is that there shall be associated with his mighty Son one hundred and forty-four thousand members of his body; and that those, together with Christ Jesus, shall constitute “the seed” mentioned in God’s promise to Abraham and through which the blessings of mankind shall eomo.—Gen. 22:17, lb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much time has been required to teach men concerning this part of the great divine arrangement, and to gather out from amongst men those who shall constitute this “seed”. First, the Lord foreshadowed by pictures what he would accomplish; then he began to develop the new creation, Much time has been required to test those who shall be members of the new creation, and who shall then be highly exalted to a place in God’s royal family. The restraining of wickedness and the blessing of mankind could not begin until God has vindicated his name and has selected and developed the instrument that he will use for this purpose. That done, then all men shall have a fair and individual trial for life, and an opportunity to learn that obedience to God leads to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah could have provided redemption at any time, and could have developed “the seed” and blessed the obedient ones long before; but had he done so only the men born up to the time ot completed redemption could have been affected and benefited by the ransom sacrifice. During the six thousand years since Adam, millions have been born into the earth. If all the people who have ever lived upon the earth were brought to perfection, and the earth were brought to an Edenic condition, there would be a sufficient number to comfortably inhabit the earth; and there would be plenty upon the earth for all. God made the earth to be inhabited by man. It is his purpose therefore to provide </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">sufficient number of men and women to inhabit the earth in due time. Therefore it is easy to be seen that in the exercise of his wi'dorn and loving-kindness God had permitted sufficient time to elapse for a sufficient number to be born into the earth, before he would begin the work of’blessing according to his promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let everyone be sure that because God has promised to restrain wickedness and bless all the families of the earth with an opportunity for life and happiness he is absolutely certain to carry out that promise, and that he will do so in his own due time. Millions of people have been born, hav.e lived on the earth, and have died. Are these to have an opportunity for the blessing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> How can they ever receive the blessing promised </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul has written: “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travailcth in pain together until now.” (Rom. 8:22) And then the apostle shows for what the creation is waiting, when he says: “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.” (Rom. 8:19) The sons of God here spoken of constitute God’s new creation, that is to say, The Christ, Jesus being the Head and his true church being the body thereof (Eph. 1:22,23; 2 Cor. 5:17) ; and Jehovah God has employed the centuries,of the Christian era to develop the new creation, and with this new creation, or ‘seed of promise’, performing its functions in harmony with the divine will during the thousand-year rule of Christ, the blessings shall come upon the human race as promised. Even the billions sleeping in the dust of the earth in death shall lie raised from the graves by divine power exercised through Christ Jesus, in order that they may learn of the vindication of Jehovah’s name and may share in the blessings purchased for them through the death of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CHEAT IS JEHOVAH, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and greatly to be irraised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, and of thy wondrous works, will I meditate. Anri men shall speali of the might of thy terrible arts; and 1 will declare thy greatness. They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">David.</span></p>

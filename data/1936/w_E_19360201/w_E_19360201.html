<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DEFEAT OF THE PHILISTINES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“For the Lord shall rise up </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in mount Pcrazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibcon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.”—Isa. 28: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH permitted the Philistines to remain in the land of Judah in order to put the Israelites to a test. The Philistines, therefore, were used by Jehovah to make a picture concerning a greater test that would come upon his chosen people, looking to the vindication of his name. Likewise God permitted Satan to continue on earth after being sentenced to death, that a witness might be given to His name on the earth and that Jehovah might in due time exhibit his supreme power to the vindication of his name. (Ex. 9:16) For the same reason Jehovah has permitted the modem Philistines, the Roman Catholic organization called “Christian”, to assume the place properly assigned to those who are devoted to him, and permitted that unholy organization to persecute his people, in order that his anointed and devoted ones might prove their integrity toward him. In these last days of peril Jehovah has made all needed provision to comfort his people and to strengthen their hope, and from time to time he unfolds his prophecies to them for this very purpose. Jehovah and Christ Jesus arc now the Teachers of those who have devoted themselves to him ami his kingdom, and these devoted ones need no man to teach them. (Isa. 30: 20) To his faithful witnesses Jehovah has given this promise: “And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they arc yet speaking, I will hear.” (Isa. 65:24) True to his promise, Jehovah is now showing his people what the prophecy concerning the Philistines means. In this hour of great stress, when the enemy is cruelty persecuting God’s people on earth, it is a great consolation to have Jehovah inform them as to why he permits such persecution and what will be the final result. As God’s faithful people study and consider these prophecies concerning the Philistines, both ancient and modern, they will receive great comfort, and it at once becomes the privilege and duty of each one who does receive such comfort to carry that message of consolation to others who desire to be comforted. (2 Cor. 1: 3-5) It seems certain that there are millions of persons of good will now under the dominating influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, as well as others, whose eyes must be opened and that these will become a part of the “great multitude”.—Rev. 7 : 9-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Jehovah has made it plain that he will locate all his enemies and render unto them a just recompense for all the wickedness committed by them: “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.”—Ps. 21:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’The evidence submitted in a preceding issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> conclusively shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief enemy on earth of God and of his anointed people, and that the ancient Philistines and their relationship with the Israelites foreshadowed this very thing. In the prophecy concerning the conspiracy to cut off bis people from being a nation the Philistines are sj&gt;ecifieally named by the Lord as being in that conspiracy. (Ps. 83:7) The text at Isaiah 28: 21 and the context clearly prove that the fulfillment of such prophecy takes place after Christ Jesus is enthroned and comes to the temple of Jehovah tor judgment. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all those religionists who now willingly take their stand with that wicked organization and against God’s anointed are the ones who claim to have made a covenant with death and hell. The Catholic Hierarchy leads in this, of course, and the other religionists have merely become a part of that organization or subject to it. It is that religious-political institution that claims that there is no such thing as death, but that all persons at death go either to purgatory or to torment. Further, the Roman Catholic system claims to be a divine institution and that those who are Catholics are not subjected to the denunciation uttered by Jehovah against the wicked. Those claims are, of course, false. Jesus used these words: “And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (AJatt. 16:18) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has seized upon and misapplied these words as the only possible proof that the Catholic institution shall stand for ever. The above-quoted words of Jesus are not subject to any such construction, and it is apparent that the Catholic claim of the meaning of such words is wholly false and finds no foundation whatsoever in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Well do we know that this is the meaning of the words of Jesus above quoted: that Christ Jesus himself, and not the apostle Peter, is the one referred to, and that the church of God, of which Christ is Head, is the church mentioned, and not the Catholic “church”. To Peter Jesus propounded this question: “Whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Then Jesus said to Peter: “Flesh and blood hath not revealed [this] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” Revealed what? Revealed to Peter that Jesus is the Christ and God's anointed King. Then said the Lord Jesus: “I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter [a man whose name is Peter] ; and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”— Matt. 10:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’Jehovah God.is referred to as the Great Rock. (Dent. 32:4) In Daniel .2; 41, 45 the Scriptures disclose that out of Jehovah’s organization he takes a “stone” or “rock’’, which is his anointed King, Christ Jesus, and this Stone grows and increases, and fills the earth and rules Ilie whole world. The rock that Jesus mentioned is The Christ, whom Jehovah had selected and anointed and to whom Jehovah has delegated the work of building His royal house, the church of God. It is written that Jehovah God, the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, has exalted Christ Jesus above all and “hath put all things under his [Christ’s] feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all”. (Eph. 1:22,23) It is Christ Jesus who builds up the church and who is the foundation thereof. Concerning the church and Christ Jesus it is written: “In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.”—Eph. 2:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• The Roman Catholic institution claims to be the sole interpreter of the Bible, has had full access to the texts of the Scriptures, should have known the meaning and doubtless did know, yet has deliberately misapplied the words of Jesus spoken to Peter and has wrongfully assumed that Peter is the foundation of “the church” and upon this foundation “the church” is built. Misapplying this scripture, the Roman Catholic organization has set up a great lie to the defamation of God’s holy name and attempted to take away that which belongs to God and Christ. There is no intimation that the church would ever be built on Peter. There is not the slightest intimation that he was the first pope. Peter never had a successor; therefore all claims of men to the title “pope”, and that the pope is the successor of Peter, arc another great lie to the defamation of God’s name. The Roman Catholic doctrine concerning the dead as being in purgatory and that priests can pray for them and relieve them of their suffering is another great lie, which has been used as a source of obtaining revenue to that system. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the creature of the Devil, who created and organized that wicked system to reproach Jehovah’s name; and, that organization being founded by the arch liar (John 8:44), it could be founded in nothing but lies. When the people are told of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, both visible and invisible, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy says: “Those scriptures do not apply to us, because we have made a covenant with death and with hell and arc at agreement therewith.” Now in view of these facts, which cannot be controverted, we can see why Jehovah caused his prophet to write to the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic organization that is controlled and dominated by “scornful men”, the following words of the prophecy, to wit: “Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem [‘Christendom’] : Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing seourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid oursclvt (b-i. 28: 14, 15) Thus the Lord declares that the m.m. i n I’ nl.s-tine organization is the offspring of Satan. The fifteenth verse of the foregoing prophecy states exactly what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims for itself. The refuge or hiding place of the entire Roman Catholic scheme is a great mass of lies. Is it the purpose of Jehovah God to destroy that refuge of lies? and if so, when?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah by his prophet answers that question in the very next verse, to wit: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.” (Isa. 28:1G) The words of this verse are addressed to his faithful anointed ones, who fully trust in and serve Jehovah. These are told that if they are devoted to God they need not “make haste”, not be unduly excited and disposed to run ahead of the Lord, but to wait upon the Lord that in due time he will act, and his action in this behalf will take place after he has laid in Zion his Stone, the precious Corner Stone, the Sure Foundation, that is to say, Christ Jesus the King enthroned, and then He will take positive and unequivocal action against the liars. It was in 1918 that Jehovah laid in his royal organization the Chief Corner Stone and Foundation Stone, Christ Jesus. It was then that he builded up Zion (Ps. 102:16), placing that precious Stone, Christ Jesus, his enthroned King, at the head; that is the same great and mighty and precious Stone, the King, that becomes the ‘stumbling stone’ to all those hypocritical pretenders, the religionists. (Isa. 8:14,15) The chief amongst these hypocritical ones who claim to serve Jehovah God, and who in fact serve the Devil, is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The laying of this Comer Stone fixes the time when the Lord would begin to take account with that wicked institution.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">• Jehovah foretold that the hypocritical religious organizations would reject Christ as King, and that such rejection would be particularly marked at the time The Stone was laid in the building up of Zion. “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the comer.” (Ps. 118:22,23) Jesus quoted this Psalm and applied it to the pretenders. (Matt. 21:42) The fulfillment of this prophecy takes place in “the day of Jehovah”, “the day which Jehovah hath made,” the beginning of which is the setting His King upon his throne and sending him to the temple for judgment. (Pss. 118:24; 2: 6 ; Mal. 3:1-5) The incontrovertible proof is that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has rejected Christ the King of the world. Although claiming to be the representative of God and Christ on earth, when Christ Jesus the King comes to the temple the Roman Catholic Hierarchy not only refuses to accept him as King but continues to insist that it is the divine right of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to rule the nations of the earth. Jehovah sends forth his witnesses to make known to the nations that he is God, that Christ is King, and that the kingdom is here; and the. Roman Catholic Hierarchy violently oppose the message and the messengers and induce the other political rukrs of the world to join with them in the persecution of Jehovah’s messengers. They enter into a conspiracy to destroy all those who are for Jehovah and his King, and to thus prevent the anointed of God from becoming a part of his kingdom. (Ps. 2: 2, 3) “They have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee,” says the prophet; and then in that same prophecy the Lord specifically names the Philistines and those associated with them as being in the conspiracy to resist the kingdom under Christ Jesus. (Ps. 83:2-7) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy specifically denies that Christ shall rule the world, but insists that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy shall rule; and this is another great lie.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">* In the prophecy of Isaiah Jehovah definitely fixes the time for the fulfillment of his judgment against the wicked institutions of the Hierarchy, and that time is after the Lord comes to the temple for judgment. The coming of the Lord to the temple for judgment was in 1918, and judgment began with the house of God and thereafter follows upon other institutions. (Mal. 3:1-3; Matt. 24: 31-40) Now in reply to the statement of the modern Philistines, as set forth in Isaiah 28:15, that “we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves”, Jehovah answers in these words, to wit: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:17) At the judgment of the house of God the approved ones are anointed, given the name of Jehovah, and sent forth as his witnesses to declare the day of the vengeance of our God. (1 Pet. 4:17; Isa. 43: 9-12; 61:1,2) This is God’s time for causing the truth concerning himself and his kingdom to be declared, and his message of truth is like a great hail storm, which tears off the veil and sweeps away the refuge or hiding place of lies, and fully exposes the hiding place thereof to the plain view of honest people.—Rev. 16:21; Ex. 9:22-26.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup>During the past few years Jehovah’s witnesses have, by the Lord’s grace, been doing this very work under the direction and commandment of the Lord. If these witnesses were declaring these things merely to do injury to others, that would be contrary to the will of God; but they are declaring these divine truths because it is the time when God has afforded the people the opportunity to know that he is the only true God, that Christ is King, and that the kingdom is the only hope of the world, and that it is in vain for man to put his trust in imperfect men or organizations. It is the time when God will permit the people to know that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is hidden behind a great mountain of lies. In order to be faithful to Jehovah his witnesses must now declare the truth that exposes the wicked Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Philistines. As these truths are declared, and the wicked ones exposed, they become very angry, and the Devil and his chief marshal Gog assemble the Catholic Hierarchy and its agents all over the earth and send them forth in a campaign of wicked persecution against God and against his anointed. —Ezek. 38:1-14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The prophecy of Jehovah is then addressed to the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the adherents thereto, to wit: “And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.” (Isa. 28:18) This positive declaration of Jehovah is that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has made with death and hell a covenant which shall not stand but shall fail, and that he will bring upon that institution a great scourge that will expose them and destroy them and that institution shall be completely annihilated. From the time the message of God’s vengeance goes forth against the hypocritical organization it constitutes a great vexation to them. Why is it that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in every country, is bitterly opposing Jehovah’s witnesses? The answer is, Because that devilish institution is vexed at ihe message of God’s Word, which is being declared by his witnesses and which exposes its very hiding place, which is the great mountain of lies: “From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.” (Isa. 28:19,20) The bed, which the Hierarchy has made for itself, and the covering of lies used to hide its nefarious work, are entirely inadequate for that purpose, says the Lord. The refuge of lies of that wicked organization shall be completely swept away. Heretofore no opposition to the Roman Catholic organization has been able to stand. Now it is Cod’s due time to take action, and no part of the Roman Catholic organization, the modern Philistines, shall stand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“RISE UP”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is merely to declare the message of God. The real work must be and will be done by Jehovah in his own good way. No human institution could possibly wreck the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. God will completely wreck it, and concerning this he says: ‘‘For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibcon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. ’ ’—Isa. 28:21.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> How may we determine that this prophecy applies to the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy? In the preceding issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> the published evidence shows conclusively that the Philistines prophetically foreshadowed the Roman Catholic organization. What took place at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon, according to the prophecy itself, foretells exactly what is to come to pass, and this the Lord makes known to his people in advance that they might receive consolation and increase their hope. Bear in mind that it is the Lord’s work and whatsoever he begins he accomplishes. The present-day persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy would, in time, necessarily result in the complete destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and their work unless God himself intervenes; and he gives his word that he will rise up and do that very thing. While the wicked persecution of Jeho\ah’s witnesses continues throughout the earth, the faithful will take great courage in the understanding of this prophecy of Isaiah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The prophecy of Isaiah 28:21 specifically refers to what is recorded by the Lord at 2 Samuel 5:17-25 and at 1 Chronicles 14: 8-17. A brief reference to that record is here appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Saul had been king of Israel for some time, but because of his unfaithfulness God removed the kingdom from him and caused David to be anointed king over Israel. ‘‘The spirit of the Lord came upon David from that [very] day. . . . But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul.” (1 Sam. 16:13,14) David with his headquarters at Hebron ruled over the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and for several years there was war between the southern and northern tribes. Abner, who was the chief man in the northern tribes, made overtures to bring about the union of all the tribes of Israel under David the king, and hence it is written: ‘‘And Abner had communication with the ciders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: now then do it: for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.”—2 Sam. 3:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>lf</sup>‘ David was thereafter installed as king over all Israel and proceeded to establish himself as king at Jerusalem. The division of the tribes and the war between the north and the south exactly suited the Philistines, and on the death of Saul the Philistines continued to exact tribute from the tribes in the northern portion. They were afraid of David. The unity of all of the tribes of Israel under David, and his being made king over all of them, alarmed the Philistines, and they made ready to attack David: ‘‘But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.”—2 Sam. 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The five kings that ruled the Philistines were in full harmony to destroy David because he was God's anointed one, under whom Israel was united. The Philistines knew of the song of the Israelites, which had been composed and sung by them to the effect, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands.’ (1 Sam. 18: 7) They wanted David, and would feel safe only when he was destroyed, and so they went after him. David is a type of Jehovah’s beloved anointed One, Christ Jesus the King, and includes all the anointed of the temple or royal house of God; and hence the prophecy applies to the anointed remnant on the earth, gathered unto Christ Jesus at the temple from and after 1918. When the Lord cleansed the temple he brought all his people into unity under Christ Jesus, the Head over the church </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and of the</span><span class="font4"> temple. (Eph. 4:13) From and after that time the faithful anointed witnesses of Jehovah have declared his message against the wicked rulers of ‘‘Christendom”, and particularly against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. As the ancient Philistines wanted to get David, so now the effort of the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, is to bring about the destruction of God’s ‘‘hidden ones”, the anointed remnant on earth.—Ps. 83: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Philistines assembled their entire army and went on the march toward Jerusalem, where they expected to find David and destroy him. ‘‘The Philistines also came, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.” (2 Sam. 5:18) Rephaim appears to be the country lying south of Jerusalem and west of Bethlehem. It means‘the place of the giants’. Doubtless David had his watchmen on the lookout, and when he was informed of the movement of the Philistines he began movement. He was too wise to be bottled up at Jerusalem; therefore he withdrew his little army and “went down to the hold’’, which was in a rough part of the country south and west of Bethlehem. David had taken refuge at the same place on two former occasions when Saul was attempting his destruction. (1 Sam. 22:4,5; 24:22) David was not now fleeing from the Philistines, but he was putting his men in a position of strategy that he might make a surprise attack upon the enemy. The Philistines, of course, greatly outnumbered David’s army, and the country that David had to traverse in order to make the attack was very difficult. The stage was set, and the picture now was made as to what shall befall the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“BAAL-PERAZIM”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The place where the battle took place was named by David “Baal-perazim”. (The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Perazbn</span><span class="font4"> means “a breach or breaking forth’’; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Baal</span><span class="font4"> having reference to Devil worship.) It means the place of the Lord’s breaking .forth against Devil worshipers, the soothsayers, the Philistines, ancient and modern. The breaking forth of the Lord there was like waters breaking their bounds and rushing like a torrent to destroy cverj thing in their way. This same place is mentioned in Isaiah 28: 21 and is there called “mount Perazim”; therefore the prophecy definitely fixes the battle illustrating the destruction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Before David began his attack he inquired of Jehovah as to what he should do: “And David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto David, Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.” (2 Sam. 5:19) David would not attempt to attack except on command of the Lord. The anointed of Jehovah trust in him with all their heart, and they have a full assurance that he will direct their paths. (Prov. 3:5, G) The Greater David is Christ Jesus, the chief officer of Jehovah God, and includes the anointed remnant on earth. The attack of David upon the Philistines, therefore, foretells the attack of Jehovah by the hand of Christ Jesus against the enemy, the modern Philistines.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> David advanced on the rear of the enemy when the Lord had assured him that “doubtless” he would deliver the enemy into David’s hands: “And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim. And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.”—2 Sam. 5:20,21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The rout of the Philistines there was complete. The illustration given by the words of the text is that of a mighty flood of waters breaking forth and sweeping everything before it. The Philistines were utterly helpless to withstand the onrush of the great flood of power that Jehovah turned loose on them. Their rout was so complete that they fled, leaving behind them their much cherished images representing the object of Devil worship, which images David destroyed. The Roman Hierarchy not only has images in all its ceremonies but largely advertises these images to sell them to obtain revenue. (See advertisements in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Directory,</span><span class="font4"> 1935.) That battle, it is true, was fought by David, but only in the strength of the Lord, and it was typical, and foreshadowed something of far greater importance to come to pass under the Greater David, Christ Jesus. The description of the battle shows the hand of the Lord in it, and this is strongly supported by the words of the record, whin Jehovah says: “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim. ’ ’—Isa. 28:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GIBEON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> There was a second fight between David and the Philistines, as described in the second book of Samuel. Again the ancient Philistines assembled themselves in the same place: “And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Repha-im.” (2 Sam. 5: 22) Doubtless the Philistines reasoned that David would again try to attack them in the same manner a.s on the previous occasion, and that this time they would be ready for David. While the Scriptures do not say that David at this time had taken his position at the hold, the presumption may be indulged that he was there. His inquiry of the Lord and the Lord’s response thereto indicate that he was at the hold and proceeded from that point to the attack: “And when David inquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.” —2 Sam. 5:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The words “fetch a compass behind” would indicate that David was commanded to so employ his army that they would be on the enemy’s flank as well as on the rear. This seems to be the first mention of flank movement in warfare. Here again the Philistines were outmaneuvered, which shows the hand of the Lord in the matter. He directed David to make the attack from a certain point indicated by the “mulberry trees”. Just what is meant by “mulberry trees” is not clear. Biblical lexicographers define the word in this manner: “Weeping; the weeping tree.” It might well picture the point at which comes a calamity upon the enemy that causes them to weep. With his army in position David must wait to receive the signal from the Lord. This proves that David was there solely at the command of Jehovah and what he was doing prophetically foreshadowed greater things to come to pass under Christ Jesus. This is the only place in the Scriptures where “mulberry trees” are mentioned, and therefore they have a specific application to the Philistines, ancient and modern.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> David waited for orders from Jehovah, and Jc-hovah told him how he might know it was time for him to ‘bestir himself’, that is, to be on the alert and then move forward in the attack: “And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.”—2 Sam. 5:24.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup>‘The sound of going’ (according to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham: &quot;A</span><span class="font4"> sound of marching”) in the mulberry trees not only seems to have furnished a signal for David to act, but clearly indicates that Jehovah’s unseen host of holy angels there participated and led the assault against the enemy. This would clearly foreshadow that when the Greater David engages in the fight against the enemy, pictured by the Philistines, his armies in heaven will take part in the fight. (Rev. 19:14) The fight took place with a disastrous result upon the Philistines. “And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.”—2 Sam. 5:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> There is no reason to doubt that these two battles between David and the Philistines are the same as that referred to in Isaiah 28:21. It is true that in the account given at 2 Samuel 5: 25 the word “Geba ” is used to denote the place. In the margin the word “Gibeon” is used to denote the same place. Also in the record of the same fight set forth at 1 Chronicles 14:16 the place is named Gibeon. “David therefore did as God commanded him; and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.” (1 Chron. 14:16) Thus is shown that the prophecy of Isaiah 28: 21 refers to the destruction of the Philistines, who were the chief enemies of God’s chosen people Israel. The fact that the Scriptural account is of two fights, to wit, Perazim and Gibeon, does not necessarily mean that the Lord will make two separate and distinct fights against modern Philistines. The point of paramount importance here is that ‘the Lord shall rise up as at Mount Perazim and shall be wroth as at Gibeon’. In other’ words, what took place at Mount Perazim and Gibeon foreshadows what the Lord will do against the antitypical Philistines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">- <sup>21</sup> Concerning Mount Perazim the record is: “David smote them there, and [David] said, The Lord hath ,broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters.” This is proof conclusive that whatever David accomplished in that fight he did it, not in his own strength, but in the strength and at the command of Jehovah God; and this foretells that the fight against the antitypical enemy, the modern Philistines, will be by the Greater David at the command of Jehovah. It was Jehovah who brought the victory Io David, and this foreshadows that the antitypical battle is not the battle of creatures against modern Philistines, but is the battle of Jehovah. The words “breach of waters” mean the breaking forth or bursting out of waters, such as the onrush of a mighty flood which scatters and disperses and destroys everything in its path. Compare this with the language of Isaiah’s prophecy in the preceding verses: “Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” This seems to indicate that God would cause his message of hard and smiting truths to rush down upon the enemy, and this accompanied by the exercise of his great power, in which he will destroy the refuge of lies behind which modern Philistines have hidden and carried on their work and will completely wipe out that organization. In his judgment against the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, not only shall the lying schemes and wickedness of that organization be exposed to view to honest people, but the organization will be brought into disgrace and completely destroyed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> But note that at Gibeon the violent indignation of God is plainly mentioned: “He shall be wroth [that is, express violently his indignation] as in the valley of Gibeon.” It was immediately following the sign which Jehovah gave to David that David bestirred himself; and then the record follows: “Then shall the Lord go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.” The Lord did there smile them, and this prophecy foreshadows that when God rises up in his anger as described by the prophet Isaiah, he will put an end to the modern Philistines by completely putting them out of business, and all their activity shall end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;STRANGE WORK”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> That which came to pass at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon was not the work of man, but was the work of Jehovah God, and therefore clearly foreshadows or prophetically foretells some greater work to be done by Jehovah thereafter. That future work is described by Isaiah’s prophecy as ‘God’s work’, “his strange work,” “his act, his strange act.” The importance of that work is emphasized by the fact that the words are repeated in the Scriptures: “his work, his strange work”;“hisact, his strange act.” Thcword “strange” here used means “foreign ; extraordinary ; wonderful; marvelous; unusual; that which is not expected”. In this connection note what God through his prophet says concerning the hypocritical crowd that draw near to him with their mouths, which without a doubt refers to the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic organization: “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work, and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, who seeth us? and who knoweth us?”—Isa. 29:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> It is the Catholic Hierarchy that has induced the people to fear and to give up their hard-earned money, and it is their “wise” men who hypocritically pose before the people as representatives of God, and who say: “Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Jehovah had left the Philistines in the land of Judah to prove the Israelites, to know whether they would hearken to his commandments. (Judg. 3:1-4) The Philistines had used the Israelites to suit their own convenience and pleasure. The prophetic drama of Samson shows how God’s people must be faithful even unto death. The prophetic picture of David’s conflict with the Philistines shows a different thing. Jehovah had installed David as king over all Israel, and now the Philistines attempted to thwart God’s purpose. The Philistines had for many years been the oppressors of the Israelites, and now God’s time had come to deliver his people from the hand of their oppressors. Therefore what took place at Mount Pcrazim and Gibeon was Jehovah’s first demonstration of his power in behalf of his kingdom. It was the first kingdom conflict, and gives the absolute assurance that Jehovah will fight for his kingdom. As soon as David was at Jerusalem as king, the five Philistine lords entered into a conspiracy to crush David and to thus prevent God from accomplishing his purposes. God took a hand and prevented the accomplishment of that wicked purpose. The record is, “All the Philistines came up to seik David.” d’hat must have been a tremendous horde of people, all marching out to make away with one man in particular and, of course, all who stood by David. It seems quite probable that this movement of the Philistines against David induced the prophet to write the second Psalm, wherein the enemy is represented as saying: “Let us break their bands asunder [that is, the bands binding together the Israelites in unity under King David and hindering the operations of the Philistines], and cast away their cords from us.” Their conclusion would be amusing to the Lord, and therefore the psalmist continues: “lie that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.”—Ps. 2:4,5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The prophecy now is having a fulfillment on a far .greater scale. We know that all true followers of Christ Jesus are now united under the King, the Greater David, and that these are loudly proclaiming Jehovah, his King, and his kingdom. Heretofore the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had its own way. It has bccn,a great test to the true followers of Christ Jesus. That wicked organization, acting under the pretext of being God’s representatives on earth, has crushed every organization that has ever risen against it. Now Christ is on his throne and God’s time has come to put his kingdom completely in control of the world. During the past few years, and since the union of the church under Christ, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has begun and carries on its assaults against God’s true people. In every country of earth the Hierarchy carries forward this wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and, as stated by Jehovah’s prophet, the Hierarchy now says: “Let us break their bands [their unity under Christ which operates as a le-straint to us] asunder.” In this the Hierarchy induces the political and financial elements of Satan’s organization, together with the Judas class, to join with them. Furthermore the prophet of God describes the Hierarchy: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83: 2-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Will not the Lord Jehovah now laugh and hold these presumptuous ones in derision? Is it not about Jehovah’s due time to “speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure”? And why? Because, says the Lord, ‘I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion, to rule the world,’ and God will permit nothing to interfere with the accomplishment of his purposes. To his King, the Greater David, he now says: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”— Ps. 2: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Clearly this seems to be the due time when Jehovah will “rise up” and assert himself, as he did in behalf of his people at Mount Pcrazim and Gibeon. Surely the prophecy shows that we arc at the time when Jehovah will cause his hail to sweep away the refuge of lies, and his waters to overflow the enemy, disclosing their wickedness, and this to be followed by his work of destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> But how can it be said that such would be Jehovah’s “strange work” or “strange act”? The fact that Jehovah fought the battle in behalf of his king David would not be at all strange to David, because David knew that he was an instrument in the hands of Jehovah to deliver the Israelites out of the enemy’s hands. Certainly David knew what is recorded in 2 Samuel 3:18, to wit: “For the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.” David’s inquiring of the Lord what he should do is further proof that what took place was no surprise to David, but does show his complete confidence in Jehovah. For these reasons the work of Jehovah upon the Philistines was not at all strange to those who were devoted to God. To the Philistines, however, it must have seemed very' strange, for the reason that they had carried on against the Israelites for years to suit their own pleasure and they had done so by permission of Jehovah, and now to have Jehovah cause them to be stricken by the Israelites, and completely' routed, would seem passing strange to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Mark how well the prophetic picture fits the reality of the present time. For a long while the Homan Catholic Hierarchy has had its own way. It is the most powerful organization under the sun, and its power and influence is exercised in every land on earth. The members of the Hierarchy are heady, high-minded, austere, and scornful men. The Catholic Hierarchy is comparatively a small body of men; but the great multitude of Catholic people that support the organization are not members of the Catholic church, but are called “children of the church” or “Catholic population”. The Hierarchy numbers its “population” or adherents by the millions. The Hierarchy now is desperately attempting to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, that there may be no hindrance whatsoever to continuing its work to control the affairs of the nations of the earth. The Hierarchy confidently expects to shortly rid the earth of these “pestiferous witnesses”, and on every hand they are heard to say, in effect, that “this crowd of Jehovah’s witnesses will not last long”. When the time comes, however, for Jehovah to rise up as he did at Mount Peraziin and at Gibeon, and to express his righteous indignation against his enemies that have persecuted his chosen people, and when he brings about the downfall of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that will be so wonderful, so unusual, so tremendous and so completely foreign to what has ever before come to pass, that millions of people who have been adherents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will exclaim: “How strange that God should destroy that organization!” They will see that the work is not the work of man, but must be the work of the Almighty; and it is to such that this work will seem “strange”. It may be confidently expeeted, therefore, that the survivors will say, in substance: “How strange that this mighty organization, which for centuries has acted as the representative of God and Christ on earth, should now be destroyed by the Lord! It is foreign to anything that has ever come to ' pass, and we cannot understand it.” The work of Jehovah here mentioned will appear strange to every one wiio does not under.slanu it, and only those will understand it who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom. To the anointed Jehovah's work will Hot appear at all strange, for the reason that they have been instructed of the Lord by his Word as to what shall come to pass, and, having been instructed, they follow ids Word and obey his commandments. They now have the information that Jehovah’ is going to destroy the wicked Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and they know that Jehovah’s purpose will be accomplished.—Isa. 46:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8T</sup> All over the earth now the faithful are being persecuted by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This persecution is so terrible and powerful that the faithful know that no human power could successfully resist the wicked organization. Anyone not having full confidence and faith in God and his promises would not dare tell the truth about the wicked organization of the Hierarchy, but the faithful have taken their stand wholly on the side of the Lord and Him they will serve, and not man. They know that their God will intervene in their behalf. They know that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the Devil’s chief visible agent on earth and that God will search out and destroy all his enemies, including the Hierarchy. Having this knowledge and assurance from the Word of God, Ilie faithful with confidence pray God to hasten the day when the enemy shall perish from the earth, and they continue with joyful words to sing Jehovah’s praises, knowing that the enemy can do nothing worse than to kill them. The salvation of God’s people he will accomplish by the hand of the antitypical David, Christ Jesus, the Beloved One of Jehovah, and the gnat King says to these faithful anointed ones: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.ii.V.)</span><span class="font4"> The anointed, therefore, confidently rest in the promises of Jehovah, and for that reason they rejoice in the tribulation that comes upon them because of their faithfulness. Seeing the fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecies, and knowing that his King is on the throne and at the temple for judgment, they look up and lift up their heads, because they know that the day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Why would Jehovah “rise up” and smite the Philistines, seeing that they had by him been permitted to have dominion over the Israelites for years? The same question may be asked, and the same answer given relative to the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Philistines were privileged to be in the land that God had assigned to his chosen people, and they tried to thwart God’s purpose to set up his typical kingdom there. Likewise for centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been suffered by Jehovah to occupy the place of his people on earth and has assumed to occupy the favored place of Jehovah; at the same time it vigorously attempts to prevent Jehovah’s carrying out his purpose concerning his faithful and anointed ones and concerning the setting up of his kingdom. It acts with revenge and cruel hatred against all who arc devoted to Jehovah. No one can be fully and intelligently serving Jehovah without opposing the wickedness of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and hence they arc hated by the II ier-archy. Long after the ancient Philistines as a nation were destroyed God caused his prophet to write the prophecy in answer to the foregoing question as to why he will rise up, and that answer is recorded in these words, to wit: “Thus saith the Lord God: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to dcstioy it for the old hatred ; therefore, thus saith the Lord Ged, Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Chercthims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.”—Ezek. 25:15-17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>89</sup> From the time of Isaac the ancient Philistines opposed God’s people and ill-treated them. From the time of the antitypical Isaac Satan’s agents have persecuted Jesus and his true followers. Particularly have the Homan Catholic Hierarchy opposed and ill-treated God’s chosen people. (Gen. 25:15-22) It is the decree of Jehovah, written long after the ancient Philistines as a nation had ceased to exist, that he would destroy the Philistines, and therefore without a question of doubt the prophecy refers to the modern Philistines, the Itoman Catholic Hierarchy and all of its conspiring lords. The day of the destruction of that wicked institution, the Itoman Catholic Hierarchy, is at hand. “And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon ; and I will turn mine hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.” (Amos 1: 8) “For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethitcs! the word of the Lord is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.” (Zeph. 2:4,5) The pride of the modern Philistines shall cease. (Zech. 9:6) The combined hypocritical and wicked religionists shall be destroyed, and this information is now given for the benefit of the remnant and for the benefit of the Jonadabs or great multitude. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font4"> page 150.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> The Scriptures seem fully to support the conclusion that the destruction of the religionists under the lead of the Homan Catholic Hierarchy will be the first part or the beginning of Armageddon. The Devil religion mislabeled “Christianity” was first put forward under the name of “the Church of Home”, out of which grew the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That organization is mentioned prophetically in the Scriptures under the unpleasant title of “the great whore”. There was a period of time when in the world there was an organization known as “Protestantism”, and which opposed the Roman Catholic organization; but about the time of the World War the Protestant (so called) organization ceased and went over, bag and baggage, to the Hierarchy, and now the entire lot constitutes “the great whore”. This crow’d of public gangsters and enemies of God set up the League of Nations as a substitute for God’s kingdom. Anything with them to turn the people away from Jehovah and his King. These, pretending to stand for God, in fact stand for and represent the Devil, and this whole bunch composes an integral part of the beastly rule of the earth. ‘And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath inclined their hearts to do his purpose,’ even to execute one purpose. (Rev. 17:16,17) (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,Book</span><span class="font4"> Two, pages 80-114.) This is exactly in harmony with Isaiah’s prophecy. Jehovah’s storm of hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and fully expose to all mankind the duplicity of ‘the old whore’, and her destruction shall precede the destruction of “the beast” and of “the false prophet”. (Rev. 19:19-21) The wicked modern Philistines shall be ensnared in their own work of their own hands.—Ps. 9:15,16. (See also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font4"> pages 139-143.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> Aside from what the Scriptures say, it would be presumptuous for any man to say how God will accomplish “his work, his strange work”, “his act, his strange act.” Whatsoever the means used by the Lord to accomplish this purpose, it will be the work and act of God just the same, even though he uses some human agencies to accomplish his purpose, as he used David at Mount Perazim. Let the faithful now rest in the fact that just as certainly as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is at the present time engaged in the persecution of those who serve Jehovah, just so certainly will Jehovah rise up and smite the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to the dust. Therefore let the faithful proceed with their work without fear and regardless of the acts of the wicked. God has shown that the Hierarchy is the Devil’s chief wicked, visible organization, and he has declared in no uncertain terms that all the wicked shall perish.—Ps. 145:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Armageddon is the work of Jehovah, because the Scriptures emphatically so declare, that God will do his work at Armageddon by the hand of Christ Jesus. The fact, however, that Jehovah by his prophet speaks of “his work, his strange work”, “his act, his strange act,” repeating the words, seems clearly to indicate two distinctive parts of Armageddon: (1) That which accomplishes the destruction of hypocritical religionists; and (2) that which accomplishes the complete destruction of all of Satan’s organization. Armageddon, therefore, as a whole is the work and act of Jehovah, but that part of Armageddon which he says is “his strange work”, “his strange act,” would seem clearly to refer to something that would appear to many creatures as very strange. The final conflict would not appear to be strange, for the reason that all professed Christians have been informed by the Scriptures and otherwise of Armageddon as one great time of trouble.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> But now consider the fact that there is one great religious organization that has been kept prominently before the people for many centuries, and which organization has repeatedly declared. itself to be the special representative of God on earth and which millions of people have been induced to believe is a divine organization. Such people are not expecting the destruction of that organization. That great religious organization is the Roman Catholic system, ruled by its Hierarchy, and to which there is attached a &quot;Catholic population” of millions of persons. All the nations of &quot;Christendom” tacitly admit that the Catholic Church system is the representative of &quot;god”, but, of course, they do not understand which god. Now when God singles out this particular Roman Catholic organization and brings it into disgrace and humiliation, as illustrated by uncircumcision and by ‘emerods in the secret parts’ of the Philistines, and then sweeps away the refuge of lies under which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has long hid its nefarious work, and exposes the hypocrisy of that organization, and then completely destroys the Roman Catholic organization, such will clearly appear to be a &quot;strange work” and &quot;strange act” of the Almighty God, and the millions of people left on earth, and who will see that marvelous work and act, will no doubt in great astonishment cry out: &quot;How strange that the Almighty God would destroy that organization against which we have been taught that nothing, not even hell, can prevail.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">** Hypocrisy is despicable in the sight of Jehovah. He says: &quot;The vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry.” (Isa. 32: G) There the Lord clearly describes the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The greatest hypocrisy ever practiced amongst men is that practiced by the Hierarchy, and the end of such is annihilation. Saul became a hypocrite. (1 Sam. 15:1-23) He was made king at the instance of the people, and he illustrates those who were once in line for the kingdom but were moved by selfishness that they might have personal gain, and receive life and power and honor. (1 Sam. 8:4-22; 10:17-25) When the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul he acted with the Philistines in the continuous effort to destroy David, God’s anointed. Saul seems clearly to picture the &quot;evil servant” class, whom the Lord Jesus described. These were once in line for the kingdom. Moved by selfishness, being rejected by the Lord at his temple judgment, these ‘began to smite their fellow servants’, and concerning such Jesus said: &quot;The lord . . . shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.” (Matt. 24:48-51) God will permit no one to successfully interfere with the establishment of his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HONEST CATHOLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Honest persons have often been deceived and led into a trap. The Catholic organization boasts to this effect: &quot;Give us a child until it is seven years old, and it will not depart from the Catholic faith.” A child brought up in ignorance of God and of his Word, and into the mind of which child there is instilled the teaching of men, the Catholic doctrine, which is contrary to the Word of God, and which child is constantly warned under the penalty of purgatory and hell to avoid reading anything that is not first approved by the Catholic priest, is almost certain to continue k; ignorance concerning Jehovah God. For this reason, by means of fear and the precepts of men millions have been held in bondage and in ignorance. The great mass of people that support the Catholic church organization are in no wise members of the church and have nothing whatsoever to do with the government thereof, and are designated by the Hierarchy, and as set forth in the publications of that organization, as &quot;Catholic population”. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Official Catholic Directory,</span><span class="font4"> 1935.) There are millions of such .who are conscientiously obeying the commands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and who are totally ignorant of the fact that they are going contrary to the Word of God. The members of the Hierarchy chuckle in their glee and say: ‘We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehoods we have hid ourselves. Who knoweth us, and who can see us?’ By reason thereof they have been enabled to keep the mass of the &quot;Catholic population” in ignorance of God and his kingdom, and to continue them in their ignorance is the reason why they warn Catholics to read none of the publications of the Watch Tower. Let those who desire righteousness be assured that God will, according to his promise, sweep away the refuge of lies behind which the Hierarchy hides, and will thus open the eyes of all honest people to the truth. Honest Catholics will then enjoy the opjwrtunity of understanding the truth and will come to know that God and his kingdom under Christ is the only hope of the human race. With the Hierarchy disgraced and destroyed the honest people, including the &quot;Catholic population”, will seek Zion, which is God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> Concerning what took place at Mount Pcrazim and at Gibeon, which marked the victory under David, the record reads (1 Chron. 11:17): &quot;And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.” Here again David represents Christ Jesus, the beloved of Jehovah, and the fear of Christ Jesus, the Greater David, clearly means the release of millions of &quot;Catholic population” from the bondage of the wicked Hierarchy. This calls to mind the words of Jolin when on the isle of Patmos. After he had seen God’s royal organization he saw a great multitude; and now Jehovah’s people have been permitted to see a great multitude and to understand the words uttered by John, to wit: &quot;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:9,10) The great multitude is beginning to be manifested, and we are assured the day of deliverance is at hand, and many of this gnat multitude shall march away from the influence of the Catholic organization. The people of good will of all nations shall come and worship before the Lord, and shall glorify his name.—Ps. 86:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> When that great multitude take a firm stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom, and in obedience to God's commandments continue to seek meekness and righteousness, they will suffer reproach at the hands of any and all of Satan’s agents remaining on earth, particularly those pictured by “the beast’’ and “the false prophet’’. They will suffer because they are companions of those who have been and are persistently announcing the kingdom of God under Christ. (Hob. 10:32-35) Let all who love God and his King now have full assurance of faith that Jehovah’s time to establish his kingdom is here and has begun and all opponents that the Devil can muster cannot possibly prevent its complete establishment. Jehovah has demonstrated and plainly shown his people that soon he will rise up and fight the battles of his people who are for his kingdom, and he is certain to rid the earth of the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and all the representatives of the Devil. The purpose of this is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and by his prophet he says concerning the infliction of this drastic punishment upon the modern Philistines: “And they shall know that I ain Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.”—lizek. 25:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.Ii.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is now conducting a vigorous campaign in all parts of the earth in its attempt to force the people into the Catholic organization. The Hierarchy is proceeding upon the theory that there are just two general classes of people, to wit, Communists and Roman Catholic, and that all who do not line up with the Roman Catholic side are therefore necessarily to be classed as Communists Clearly this is the Devil’s effort to separate the people and checkmate the work that the Lord Jesus is doing. Christ Jesus is now separating the persons of good will, who are called the “sheep’’ class, from those that are wicked, whom he designates as the “goat” class. (Matt. 25:32-46) The Devil, operating through the Hierarchy, is trying to offset the Lord’s work by separating the people into the classes of Communists and Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>49</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its political and financial dupes and allies have suppressed the Watch Tower Society and confiscated its property in the countries of Austria and Germany and other parts of “Christendom”. It has recently caused many countries and states to enact laws for the purpose of suppression of speech and publication of the truth. It has caused many of the faithful to be persecuted unmercifully, ill-treated, and thrown into prison, and continues its wicked work. These modern Philistines deal by revenge and with a despiteful heart, and the Lord’s faithful people continue to suffer. Many have wondered why God permits this. Let none of the faithful be disturbed. Let all who love God and Christ Jesus now fully rest in faith and with greater determination than ever go on with the sendee of the Lord, knowing this, that God’s announced purpose to rise up and smash the enemy will soon take place and every one who continues faithful to the Lord amidst all these trials shall receive the everlasting blessing of Jehovah. Surely Jesus had in mind just such times when he said: “lie that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) Our God, whom we serve, will save and deliver his people to the honor and glory of his name.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SECURITY UNDER GOD’S KINGDOM</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">S</span><span class="font4">ECURITY of life and property is a thing much desired and sought by all honest people. Under present unsatisfactory governments the people in general do not feel secure in their property, in their limbs, or in their lives. The desire of man for righteousness is expressed in the Constitution, which is the original fundamental law of the United States government. The framers of that document desired righteousness, doubtless, and put forth their best endeavors to see it established in the earth. The unseen enemy exercised his evil influence and the ruling powers soon departed from the fundamental law, and that to such a degree that the Constitution originally' made can now hardly be recognized. Great monopolies are formed by a few men who have unlimited money and great power and influence among the official element of the nation. These selfish men go into the government business, and their chief interest is to increase their power and wealth. With them the liberties, the peace, the property, and even the lives of the people are matters of secondary importance. These selfish men having to do with the government put forward their tools to be elected to office. The people go through the form of electing their representatives to the various departments of government and these are overreached by the selfish interests. Those who should properly be the servants of the people are enticed and induced to enact statutory laws contrary to the general welfare and for the benefit of the few. Under such laws the people are exploited, hoodwinked, and robbed. Some citizens go into court for redress, only to find that the selfish monopoly has overreached and wrongfully influenced the courts They soon learn that a man without great wealth and much influence has little or no show in the courts. Well has a distinguished American lawyer said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Nowhere in our social fabric is the discrimination between the rich and the poor so emphasized to the average citizen as at the bar of justice. Nowhere should it be less. . . . Money secures the ablest and most adroit counsel. . . . Evidence can be gathered from every source. The poor must be content to forego all these advantages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Sinclair, owner of many millions of dollars and of powerful influence, was put on trial at Washington, the national capital, on a criminal charge of defrauding the United States government of its oil supplies. During the course of the trial charges were made that there was evidence of an attempt by the defendant to bribe the jury. The trial resulted in Mr. Sinclair’s acquittal. As further evidence that the United States government (the one most nearly ideal yet on earth) does not deal equally with its citizens let her learned senators testify. Immediately following the acquittal of Mr. Sinclair the following statements were made by members of the United States Senate and appeared in the public press on the 22d day of April, lti’28:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The then Senator Heflin said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It will convince the people that a ‘double system’ of criminal jurisprudence for rich and poor operates in this country. Sinclair comes on to be tried and we find him trying to tamper with the jury. This verdict is astounding in view of the ruling of the Supreme Court, which held the transaction was branded all over with fraud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Senator Norris said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The acquittal shows that you can’t convict a hundred millions under the jury system. The Supreme Court declared the whole transaction fraudulent. Sinclair didn’t even testify and he didn’t deny the charges. His acquittal proves that if you have enough money you can escape anything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The then Senator Edwards said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was not a court jury that acquitted Sinclair, but the duplicity of Republican party leaders, cabinet officials and trusted public servants in the Harding-Coolidge administration, which paved the way for just such a travesty as was consummated at the nation's capital today. If the high and mighty of this government can be bought and paid for with impunity, why should America place the entire burden of meting out justice to her criminals on the shoulders of a financially weak and impoverished jury whose inherent fallibility is their only armor against intimidation and fraud?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such conditions will not be possible under God’s government, because that government will be a righteous one and all the people, both poor and rich, shall have an equal show’. (Isa. 11:4) In fact there will be no rich and no poor. There will be those who are haughty and those who are meek or poor in spirit. The haughty will be compelled to come down from their exalted positions, and the poor and meek will be lifted up, that all may have an equal and common standing before the great, just and righteous Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time men of extreme selfishness, by their wealth, power and influence, control the great publicity channels through which they attempt to mold public opinion to suit themselves and to blind the people to the real truth. Editors of many of these publications would publish the truth if left unhindered, but they must yield to the power that is wielded by selfish interests or be crushed. The result is that if truth is brought to the attention of the public press it is either suppressed or garbled in such manner that it could not be recognized as truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a clergyman expresses his own wisdom and makes God and his Word appear as unworthy of consideration, such is given wide publicity by the public press. The great monetary interests know how to Hatter the ambitious clergymen. They therefore throw a little sop to these clergymen and the clergymen are eager to grab it. Those who really control the governments tolerate the clergymen because they can be used to deceive and exploit the people. They furnish a sanctimonious smoke screen behind which the conscienceless profiteer works. It is a daily practice for one of these so-called and supposed representatives of the Lord to stand in the house of the great legislative body and invoke a blessing upon those who are branded as ‘‘boodlcrs, grafters, and lobbyists”. If one of these clergymen utters an unusual prayer asking for blessings upon the men who foment war and exploit the people the public press speaks in commendatory terms thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the governmental interests are being looked after by the ‘‘boodlers, grafters, and lobbyists”, and profiteers, the people at home are being exploited by some other selfish interests operated under the title and name of trust companies or like financial instil u-tions w'hich receive special protection from the government. These financial institutions induce a certain number of the more respectable people of the community to invest some of their funds with them or take some stock in their corporations and depend upon these to keep those who are exploited quiet. Every effort is put forth by the favored and selfish interests, in which effort they are aided and abetted by the clergy and the subsidized press, to suppress the truth and keep the people in ignorance of the real truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the great benefits that shall result to the people under the righteous government of God and his Christ will be the lifting of the veil of ignorance and wrong and turning on the light so that the truth may be known and that the people may fully understand that all their benefits and blessings come from Jehovah God. Concerning this it is written: ‘‘Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:17) ‘‘And he will destroy in this [government] the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.”—Isa. 25:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people do not now feel secure in their homes or property, and they are not secure. A young man buys a modest home in a city, or a little farm. lie finds that he must pay a bonus to some financial institution to get a loan on his property. He must pay a high rate of interest on his mortgage; and he must pay ever increasing taxes, both general and special, lie soon secs that the burden upon him is so great that it endangers the security of his home. He is in constant fear of losing it. Sooner or later he is unable to bear up under the burden, the mortgage is foreclosed, and his property is in the hands of the cruel and selfish interests. One of the great benefits that will result to the people under the righteous government of the Lord will be that a man will be secure in his home and in his property. Then men will build houses and live in them as their own. They will not build for another to take it away from them. (Isa. 65:22) The oppressor and extortioner will not be permitted then to &lt;&nbsp;perate. The conditions will be favorable and equitable and every one will have a fair opportunity. Ender the righteous government of the Lord man will not fear. ‘‘But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. ’ ’—Mic. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the people will put away selfishness and learn to honor God. And what will be the result ? In Proverbs 3: 9,10 the answer is given: ‘‘Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase : so shall thy bams be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It must now be apparent to all who think soberly and honestly, that the present unhappy conditions can never be remedied by man. Centuries of experience prove that with man such is impossible. When we gain a knowledge of the reason for these distressing conditions and what is God’s remedy, then it is easy to see that the only way to have lasting peace and continuous prosperity and security is by and through the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus.</span></p>

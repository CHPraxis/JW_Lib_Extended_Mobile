There are approximately 15,000,000 families in Germany, and in the fourteen years from 1919 to 1933 they received an average of three books or booklets and more than five periodicals, besides a large distribution of free literature. ‘To whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required; and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.’</span></p>

The court declared: “The National-Socialist State is not minded to misuse its organs to supervise the family life of individuals, still less to interfere with their religious beliefs; but when a group of men exert themselves to bring about the collapse of the state system and erect an international sovereignty in its place, that is not religious, but political activity.” Thus the Nazi State in effect forbids anybody to pray with sincerity, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done,’ and insists that present devilish governments like their own must continue for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS significant that at the same time that the German secret police seized 150 Roman Catholic priests for possessing and circulating Communist literature they also resumed their attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses, the innocents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">BELATED dispatch from Berlin indicates that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">property of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society at Magdeburg, Germany, is being liquidated under joint supervision of the American Chamber of Commerce and an officer of the German secret police. At hand a copy of “The Black Corps” (“Das Schwarze Korps”), official organ of Hitler’s personal bodyguard among the storm troopers. The page contains seven illustrations, the evil intent of which is to represent Jehovah's witnesses as a commercial group. One of the pictures shows the plant at Magdeburg closed, with signboards across the entrance which state that the property is for sale or for rent in whole or in part. Also, to bring intended ridicule upon the cause of Jehovah God, over one of the entrances there is a huge cartoon poster announcing a masquerade ball at The Crystal Palace. Does anyone who has any reverence for Jehovah God imagine that these bitter, malevolent persecutions of His people will go unpunished?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">ORBIDDEN to hold meetings in Germany Jehovah’s witnesses appealed to the Weimar Republican Constitution. The Nazi court at Hamburg thereupon officially declared that the Constitution is dead, having died the day the Nazis came into power. Jehovah’s witnesses will be much interested in this official declaration that Germany legally ceased to exist when the Nazis gained control. Most certainly the present “government” is a new and peculiar beast, and manifests it in every way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ETTERS from Germany describe the Son-dergericht or Volksgericht (emergency courts or people’s courts) introduced by Hitler. The letters say, succinctly, “There is no trial, only conviction, and no appeal.” What degradation! And this in the face of the new worship of the German blood by which the German people are encouraged to deify themselves in the silly belief that they are not like other men, but are gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crime to Praise God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T IS now a crime in Germany to praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God. In Berlin on January 16, 1936, twenty-one of Jehovah’s witnesses were sent to prison for from three to four months for singing hymns in praise of the Most High God. It was charged that they did not forsake the assembling of themselves together, as commanded by God’s Word, but continued to meet despite the demands of the Ratti-Hitler combination that they cease doing so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ERMANY is witnessing a most extraordinary attempt to destroy the Word of God. Suddenly a new order was issued that the only Scriptures that may be circulated in Germany must be printed in Gothic characters. A column account says at its conclusion: “The Bible societies are getting rid at heavy discounts of their old stocks of Bibles printed in Latin characters. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, an American organization, seems to be one of the agencies most affected by the new order.” “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; [Jehovah] shall have them in derision.”—Psalm 2:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">S IN Italy Mussolini is determined that the state shall be first and the Roman Catholic church second, so with the Nazis in Germany. Yet there is an understanding between the two organizations. This was in evidence in Berlin, August 4 last, when red placards at every street corner warned Nazis and others that &quot;outrages against the Roman Catholic church” must cease and that &quot;the government and the party will put an end to the shameless practice”.</span></p>

The partnership between the pope and Hitler is somewhat like that of two boys sleeping in an attic in New York state in the winter. Both are trying to get into the middle of the bed, and, though neither one entirely suc</span><span class="font6">ceeds, each has some share.</span></p>

Dr. E. Schmucker, metropolitan of the Greek Orthodox church in Germany, put in a concentration camp, was kicked and forced to work in freezing weather clad only in trousers and shirt. A London lawyer, at the International Penal Congress, in Berlin, stirred all the delegates mightily when he said: “The idea of giving the judge the right to curtail the length of speeches and to refuse evidence to shorten the trial is entirely contrary to British ideas of justice. We feel that the proposal to shorten trials has been introduced here to obtain international sanction for that type of trial which takes place in this country.”</span></p>

In the Fascist countries the capitalists used the middle class as a cat’s-paw to aid them in breaking up the organizations of labor. Now that job is done, Italy is going to war with Abyssinia to keep the middle class from learning the truth—that Mussolini cannot restore their wealth and power. He hopes to keep them quiet by giving them ‘glory’ as did Napoleon with the French more than a hundred years ago. Hitler in Germany is arming for the same reason. Both the Italian and German armies can be used at home, should the middle class become restless, suspicious and rebellious.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“A German Jew who wants to sell his business gets a bad price, first, because of the damage caused by the boycott.

Thirdly, of the low price received, if it still exceeds 50,000 marks, 25 percent must be paid as emigration tax. Fourthly, the remainder is paid over in Sperrmarks, and can be realized abroad only at a rate of less than 30 percent. As the rate of the Sperrmark is largely determined by actions of the German government, there is the possibility of its being brought down still further. Jewish fortunes in Germany, created by the industrious work of generations, are almost entirely expropriated by the Nazi State, which does not bother if the Jewish family starves abroad. But foreigners who visit Germany are told that Jews in Germany are obviously quite happy, since they do not emigrate.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The people in general are much embittered about the cruel persecution of the Jews. <sup>(&lt;</sup>We are very well informed concerning several cases [of such pogroms] that they were staged by the rulers themselves.” At the order of the government their Jew-baiters and Jew-beaters had to leave their uniforms at home lest they be recognized as official agents.

<p><span class="font6">TUNG by the world’s bitter comments regarding its outrageous treatment of the Jews, and yet determined to get all possible out of the circumstances, Germany invented a plan for recompensing those forced out that is unique and practical and from some points of view is fair. Heretofore the fugitive could take with him about 25 percent of his property; the rest was lost. Now he may turn his German fortune over to some German concern that has export connections and accept his pay in a mortgage at 4 percent. In the fourth year he receives 10 percent of the principal, and from then up to the thirteenth year equal annuities each year. By this method, though he gets nothing the first three years, the Jew, if nothing happens to Germany in the meantime, gets back about 65 percent of his property in thirteen years, and meantime has every reason in his new homeland to wish prosperity to Germany, and especially to the concern in which he has his mortgage interest. The efficiency expert that thought out that scheme was certainly a clever schemer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ichael de Montaigne and Baron de Coupene had charge over a church property or estate named Lonhatan. It lay in a lonely but fertile valley, which well provided its two hundred inhabitants. Lonhatan shut itself off from the rest of the world, knew no difference in social standing or work, and the people were happy, lived a regular life and grew old. This peaceful corner made Satan angry, and one night he suggested to the stupidest man in Lonhatan to send his son away to be educated. He did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the young man came back, educated as a lawyer, a goat was missing just at that time. Goats then disappeared quite often, but no one became excited about it. This time, however, the lawyer hollered so much about the goat’s being stolen that he got his first lawsuit, parties were formed, there was mudslinging, and shortly the young advocate had a good income and was satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since anger is bad for gall and bladder, a few of the inhabitants fell ill, and a young doctor happening to visit the lawyer found it profitable to take up his domicile in the community. He taught the people how much pain they could have, and from how many diseases they could die. Up to that time everything in Lonhatan had been treated with garlic, and with good results, but after the doctor arrived only bad-tasting and expensive medicines were used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make the medicines the doctor called for a druggist. From that time the mortality took such a jump that the cemetery was enlarged and a young clergyman was engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing that only four men of science were in Lonhatan, every family wanted one of their own to have the title of doctor. Alas! it was all over with equality in social standing and work. The “brains” were triumphant and duly honored. As soon as Satan saw that twelve graduated Bachelors of Science had come to live in the once peaceful valley, he saw that he could turn his attention to some other place; for in Lonhatan his business was in good hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N THE </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Record</span><span class="font6"> Hendrik de Leeuw tells of the horrible conditions that have arisen in Germany under the Nazi regime. Some of the items for which De Leeuw vouches are that there are 45,000 homosexuals in Berlin; that in Berlin there are more abortions than births; that in Berlin there are almost as many midwives as doctors, and one of these midwives interviewed by De Leeuw and another doctor admitted that she performs on an average four abortions a day; that since his last visit to Germany prostitution has increased tenfold; that there have been more cases of rape by German Nazis on Jewish women than in any previous time during the history of Germany. De Leeuw marvels at the mental conditions that would permit the Nazis to “in the same breath shout for extermination of the Jew and in the other debauch and defile young Jewish women and girls, many of the latter being under age”. He states that there are nine thousand registered and fourteen thousand clandestine prostitutes in Berlin, with the girls’ fees ranging from one to three marks. This information was sent to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> by a New York physician who thinks that, under the circumstances, the Nazi boast that Germany has a superior civilization falls of its own weight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the Nazis advertised in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deutscher Bauer</span><span class="font6"> for a wife. At the outset he was willing to content himself with the following: “I want a brave, original German girl as a comrade for life. She must be of northern blood and character, rectangular in body and soul, of healthy natural feelings, with a sense of sacrifice, a thirst for freedom, a woman’s pride, and a joy in singing. She must have a passionate devotion to her nation and a heart in love with nature, sun and bodily exercise. She must be a real woman, symmetrically straight, perfectly healthy, undeviatingly true and honest, a fearless, faithful girl, determined to find a newer, finer life. She must be ready for agricultural work and fitted for it and she must be ready to take her place by the side of a straight, healthy, nature-loving, sport-loving, rustic German man. Dolls of dancing and of fashion need not apply. Private fortune not indispensable.” What such a woman would want with such a man is the unsolved problem.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>Church’s Commission</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font6">OD has called and selected His church for a specific purpose. He has commissioned His church to do certain things. A commission is a warrant of authority commanding the performance of certain duties. The Lord Jesus is the head or chief one of the church, and that commission applies primarily to Him. That commission is recorded at Isaiah 61:1,2, and, amongst other things, says: ‘The spirit of Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach the good news unto the teachable.’ This commission applies to all of those who are in Christ Jesus and faithfully following in His footsteps. Each one, in obedience to this commission, must give testimony of the truth or good news. Jesus declared the very purpose of His coming to earth was to bear witness to the truth, and which is in fulfillment of this commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That message of good news or gospel, in brief, is this: That Jehovah is the only true and almighty God; that Jesus Christ, His beloved Son, is the Redeemer of man and the world’s rightful Ruler; that in God’s due time Christ Jesus will take over all power and authority, destroy all wickedness, and rule the world in righteousness, and that all who obey the Lord shall live for ever in happiness, and all others shall be destroyed. In harmony with the commission the angels of heaven announced at the birth of Jesus these words from Jehovah: ‘Behold, we bring you good news of great joy which shall be unto all people. . . . Glory in the highest unto God, and on earth peace amongst men of good will.’ (Luke 2:9-14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> That means that only those who have good will toward God are brought into the condition of peace with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who voluntarily agree to do God’s will and wholly devote themselves to the Lord He calls to a place in His organization and commissions them to follow Christ Jesus and be witnesses to Jehovah. To them He says: ‘Ye are my witnesses and my servant; ye are my witnesses that I am God.’ (Isaiah 43: 9-12) In order to receive the approval of God these witnesses must faithfully perform the commission, which means that they must tell others who will hear the good news concerning Jehovah and His kingdom. Such witnesses are true Christians because true followers of Christ Jesus. They are not commissioned to save souls, but to tell the truth, that others may learn the only way of salvation. Concerning these commissioned ones called to be members of the church of God He caused to be addressed in these words (1 Peter 2:9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font6">: “You are a chosen race, ... a holy nation, a people for a purpose; that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light.” All who become members of the real church must do faithfully what God has commanded them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who receive this command from God, and who faithfully perform that commission, are ultimately changed in the resurrection from human to spirit creatures, and will for ever be associated with the Lord Jesus in heaven. (Revelation 20:4) The whole number thereof is limited to 144,000. No man or body of men selects them, because God alone selects and commissions His church. These are taken to heaven only upon condition that they prove entirely faithful in the performance of their God-given commission, and are the only ones of the human race that will ever be taken to heaven. There are millions of persons on earth who want to know God and Christ Jesus and serve in His kingdom, but who are not commissioned or anointed of the Lord, and they will never be taken to heaven. These are mentioned in the Scriptures as the “great multitude”, and will be considered on another occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many persons are led to believe that they are members of the church and will go to heaven when they die because they have tried to obey the rules of some earthly organization called a “church”. Jesus said, at Matthew 7: 20, 21: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” “Fruits” representatively stand for the message that professed followers of Christ bring to others, and it is only those who take to the people the true message of God’s kingdom that will be received by Him. It is only those who do the will of God by faithfully performing the commission given them that Christ will approve and receive as members of His kingdom. Concerning those who have assumed the name of Christ and preach selfish doctrines of men the Lord Jesus says they are lawless, and He commands them in these words: “Depart from me, ye workers of lawlessness, for I never knew<sup>7</sup> you.” Jesus was faithful in performing His commission, and all His followers must likewise be faithful. He was persecuted, and for the same reason Jehovah’s witnesses are now persecuted by the Devil and his agents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font6">HAD the pleasure of listening in on your world-wide radio broadcast yesterday (Sunday) afternoon and want to commend you for your fearlessness and intestinal fortitude in coming out and frankly accusing that monster, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, of bringing under control and subjecting not only the Protestant peoples of the world, but Jews and all other denominations, to a new Inquisition, the horrors of -which will be more terrible than the last, as they have plenty of experience to draw upon. I have waited, and sometimes not patiently, since 1930 for a man of your caliber to tell the people of the United States what has been taking place since late 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All peoples banded together and prevented Rome from putting a Catholic president in Washington, when they thought the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font6"> was right and at the same time causing the U.S. to intervene in Mexico, but going right back to sleep in 1928. Our president, I think, from several of his speeches in 1930 and 1931, was aware of what was taking place but was afraid of bloodshed if he told the people. After this setback the Catholic church didn’t stop, but set out to accomplish and have accomplished gaining control of our money. How? By being the cause of the great financial crash, commencing in 1929, of our commodity, stock and bond markets, driving us to the very brink of hell in 1932. Now they are behind the inflation movement, through the same source, to complete the ruin. The pope and the consistory are past masters in the art of speculation. Who is behind the destruction of all kinds of foodstuffs, killing of hogs, plowing up wheat and cotton, etc., to create a shortage and bring about this inflation? You know the answer. Our present administration has violated every natural and God-given law that ever existed. Our political offices are in the control of Catholics. In the state of South Dakota 85 percent of our public officers are Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I fully coincide with your views. More power to you in endeavoring to awake the American people, non-Catholic, before we are entirely ruined, if that is possible.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>“In Prisons Oft”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">(A letter to Judge Rutherford from three of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font6">REETINGS in the name of Jehovah, our King Eternal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You undoubtedly know of the arrest and imprisonment of thirteen of Jehovah’s witnesses at Irvington campaign, February 16, ten brothers and three sisters, one of whom I was privileged to be. Since the experiences of the sisters were rather unique in this case, we thought you might be interested in hearing of them, and I have been asked by Srs. Schuster and Morgan to write you for the three of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had all worked about two hours when taken in, though in separate groups and sections of the city, and arrived at the police station within a half hour of each other, and around noon. Our bags with literature were taken from us, and when the matron arrived we were searched and locked up in a small room. We knew some brothers were in, and afterwards heard some more being taken through the hall. We had all made requests to telephone, which were ignored. We heard them tune in WBBR at 3:45 p.m., and know they listened to the drama all the way through, though they closed the door so we couldn’t hear it, only very faintly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About six o’clock, I think it was, we were called and told to take our things and forward march, and, as we came out into the hall, saw the brothers, ten of them, coming into the hall also. Upstairs into a cold courtroom, and in a few minutes a tall, broad-shouldered, blond man entered and took the judge’s seat. After reading the charges in each case, pronouncing us 'guilty’, he ordered us held under cash bond for trial on Monday. In the case of the sisters he stated that if the money was not paid by eight o’clock we were to be sent to the Detention House in Newark, making the excuse that they had not the conveniences for keeping us at the jail in Irvington over night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we were returned downstairs we asked for something to eat, as we had had nothing since early morning. I explained to the officer that I could not eat anything cooked in aluminum, had not been well, and had been under the doctor’s care for several months; so he brought some fruit and milk for me, and hot supper for the other two. At eight o’clock we were ordered to get our things on and were taken in a radio car to the Detention House in Newark and turned over to the superintendent, Mr. Burgess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our clothes were taken from us and we were given uniforms to wear while there, but were allowed to keep our purses and personal things, though warned by the matron to 'carry them with us all the time, as the girls there would steal anything they could find’. We slept in a dormitory with others, almost all of whom were young girls of the hardest-boiled type. There was a separate dormitory for the colored girls, so Sr. Morgan had to go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a general recreation room where you could sit on a hard bench at a table and read when work was done. We ate in a dining room off tables with white enameled top, and the food, what there was of it, was good and was not cooked in aluminum, and everything was clean. However, fruit is an unknown quantity there, and only white bread is served. I was quite ill with a cold when I went there and they did not ask me to work, but the other two had to do some work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Monday morning we were told to get ready for court, but instead of court it was the Hall of Records where we were taken, to be measured, weighed, fingerprinted and photographed. Before taking the photographs, they put on us a breastplate, not of righteousness, but that we might, like Jesus, be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">numbered</span><span class="font6"> with the sinners. Then we returned to the Detention House just in time to see some friends who had been there to try to see us and bring some fruit. I asked if we could see them, but not only was I refused the privilege, but we were all then and there upbraided for being what we were and for what we had been doing, according to their interpretation, by a Mr. Ryan, who was on duty at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That afternoon I asked if we could have a Bible, and later received a brand-new Gideon, for which we were duly grateful to our heavenly Father. The time from then until we left to go to the trial on Wednesday we spent studying “to show ourselves approved unto God”, that we might be equipped for the trial. As we had opportunity we witnessed to those around us, but the girls were very “hard-boiled” and it is a question as to whether we made any real impression on them. Two of the matrons seemed to be kindly disposed to us because of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wednesday morning we were called for the trial, which lasted until late that night, as you probably know. I was fined $50; and the other two sisters, $25 each. I was the only one of the three put on the stand. Before the cases were all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tried we sisters were sent downstairs to wait in the waiting room, not locked up; so we had the privilege of seeing some of the friends. After it was all over and nearly all of the friends had gone, the judge suddenly decided to let us sisters out in the custody of our attorney until Friday. Sr. Morgan lived near, Sr. Schuster was able to go with friends still there, but I had to take a bus after almost an hour’s wait on the corner in the bitter cold. I was very glad to go home, and gave thanks to Jehovah that it had been so arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Friday we went back to Irvington, waited all the afternoon for the judge or clerk of court, neither of whom showed up; so all efforts to take us out on bond pending appeals were balked. There was nothing for the attorney, Mr. Waks, to do but to turn us over to the police. The brothers had been held in jail all this time. We were taken downstairs and again locked up in the little room. I overheard the officer to say that the judge would be there at seven o’clock to sign the commitments and that they were going to get rid of the whole bunch of us that night. Finally they came and brought us some supper, hot, but served in aluminum, so I had to forego most of mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At three minutes to eight they called us to get our things and come on. We supposed we were to be taken to Newark jail, but when we got outside to the desk the officer on duty said he had a telephone message from the judge saying he couldn’t get there that night and that we could go home and come back the next morning at eleven o’clock. An officer standing near warned us that if we were not back they would send for us on a bench warrant. Sr. Schuster had no way of getting to her home, so I took her home with me on the bus. When we arrived about nine-thirty I reported to Brother Bossier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next morning we returned to Irvington by eleven o’clock, only to be informed that the judge had changed his mind again, and had telephoned we were to be allowed to go home until ten o’clock Monday morning. Did our hearts leap for joy, as we had desired to go to the New York convention, and now the Lord’s angels had opened the door! We knew we could have no part in the service that morning, but would be in time for the afternoon sessions and could go home with our people from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Needless to say we hastened on our way, that is, Sr. Schuster and I did, as Sr. Morgan couldn’t very well go that day. When we arrived in New York at the Mecca Temple we located Brother Moyle who just happened to be talking to Brother Bossier at the time and reported to them our experience and privilege in being allowed to attend the convention. Words fail us to express our appreciation for this great blessing which was to strengthen us for the coming trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eeturning to Irvington on Monday morning we were allowed to go in and see the brothers who were still locked up, five of them, and to give them a little of the convention news. We learned that they too had had a blessing in being allowed to hear your lecture at three o’clock in the outer waiting room, in the company of eight or nine officers, and that they had also been able to send you a telegram, and we rejoiced with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We took up another siege of waiting in the waiting room. Sr. Cohen had come to bring some things to the brothers, and she waited with us. It was after one o’clock when we were told to get our things on, and then, before we knew it, the brothers were there, too, with their bundles and we were all hustled out into the patrol and with two policemen on the ends of the seats, on our way to, we supposed, the Newark county jail. However, one of the brothers remarked we were going in a funny direction, and then that they must be taking us in a roundabout way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Someone asked one of the officers where we were going, and they said, “Caldwell!” It was a blow, for we had heard some things about Caldwell, at the Detention House; but we gathered our smiles and left it with the Lord, knowing He was well able to take care of us. We were anxious as to whether Sr. Cohen would find it out before she left, but the Lord saw to that too. When we arrived I asked the warden what oui’ sentences were, and learned that mine was twenty days and the other sisters ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were put in the women’s building, had to give up all we took in with us, were stripped of our clothes, given showers, and then the prison garb from skin out. We asked for and were allowed to keep our sweaters after they made sure they were clean! Everything was washed or fumigated to make sure no disease was being brought in. We were booked and given to understand that if w’e did not work we would not eat, that we could write and receive only two letters per week. No one could see us without a pass, and then two persons only on different days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Afterward we learned we had to be there fourteen days before we could see anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were advised by the head matron that if anyone asked us why we were there we were to say we didn’t know, we suppose we had done something wrong, we didn’t know just what; but we refused to do as advised, telling her we must be honest and tell the truth, that we were arrested for preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. She said, Well, of course, that is up to you, but it would make it easier for you if you followed my advice.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were domiciled on the quarantine tier, where they have to stay for a week, then if everything is O.K. they are transferred downstairs, given a nicer uniform, white apron, etc. The next morning some girls who had been there since the previous Thursday were changed before their week was up, evidently to leave us alone. The next morning the head matron came to see us and tell us she was going to leave us there for the full time of our stay, so we could be alone. She let us have our Bibles and promised me the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> book I had with me after she had a chance to look it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cells and corridor were not unattractive, but the beds were awful, worse than boards, and the food was not much. However, everything was very clean, and we cannot say they were entirely unkind to us. We gave the head matron a witness Tuesday morning and she seemed to agree with all we told her, but asked if it was true that Judge Rutherford lived in a palace in California, etc. Wednesday we were called downstairs to be fingerprinted again, and the man doing the job vented his spleen on Sr. Morgan, as he couldn’t hold in any longer, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Waks came at 1: 30 to have us sign some papers, and later we again were called to the office to see the doctor, who questioned us in regard to the time we were to be in there, instead of our health, and when he learned I had twenty days and the other sisters only ten, he was curious as to why? I told him I was, too. We understood that he would take a blood test, but he didn’t do anything, and I suppose he was there only to get his fee recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thursday morning we were called and told to get ready to go out, and found that a policewoman, who they say can shoot surer and faster than any cop on the force, brought up a new prisoner and was to take us back to Newark, where we waited for two hours for them to bring the brothers down, as they were working on the coal pile. Arrangements were then completed for our release on bond until March 30. I have given you only the high lights, as I know your time is limited, and you need your strength for other things, but even at that I am afraid the narrative has been rather lengthy, and I ask your forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In conclusion, we wish to say that the experience has been a great strength to us, showing us the favor of Jehovah in permitting this opportunity of proving our faithfulness, and, by His grace, our hands will not be slacked, and when March 30 comes, if it be His will we will go back to finish our sentence, and if not, then we will know the victory will still be His, and we shall continue to praise His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Assuring you of our love and prayers that you may be given the strength to continue ‘pressing the battle to the gate’, and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, we are</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ROM Tripoli, Syria, comes the information that a group of Jehovah’s witnesses met there on the evening of February 23 and heard (from 10: 00 to 11: 00 p.m.) Judge Rutherford’s lecture delivered that same day at Los Angeles, at noon, Pacific Time. The translation says: “All present rejoiced and gave thanks to Jehovah for this wonderful provision of hearing the most important message that has been delivered in modern times, ‘Separating the Nations.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>Obeisance to the Pope in Griffin, Ga.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE chief officials of Griffin, Georgia, are not at all satisfied with the American bill of rights. They do not believe in freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and freedom of worship. They believe in framing mischief by a law against the righteous. They think it smart to prostitute the courts for their evil purposes. They would turn the wheels of progress back to the Dark Ages and install themselves as the tycoons and popes of an American city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On January 28,1936, the board of commissioners of Griffin passed an ordinance regulating the distribution of printed matter. Under this ordinance no person can distribute New Year cards to the homes of his friends without permission of the city manager. If you pass out a few Bibles to homes in the city, you can be declared a nuisance and sentenced to prison. The city manager is boss. He can determine what is to be distributed to the people of the city. What kind of people live in a town that will let one man decide what can be given to them in their homes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Sunday, March 15, a group of Jehovah’s witnesses went to Griffin to worship God through preaching the gospel by printed page from door to door. That is the way Jesus and the disciples worshiped Jehovah, so presumably no good Christian would now object to anyone’s following the practice. The acting chief of police, the city manager and the chairman of commissioners very evidently do not consider themselves to be Christians, for they became greatly enraged when notified that Jehovah’s witnesses had come to town to preach the gospel. ‘Gather them in and lock them up,’ were the orders given to the police, and the great crusade against truth and righteousness in Griffin began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The officers labored diligently. They arrested and thrust into jail eighty-two of these Christian people. They made no discrimination as to age, sex, race or color. Little Shirley Rogers, age 4, who must have been a terrible menace to the town, was brought in with the others. Another little girl, age 12, was also locked behind the bars. Two men were arrested for driving a car through the town. Others were arrested because they were Jehovah’s witnesses, and therefore had no business being in Griffin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the police and city manager had done all they could to make the city like an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">equus asinus,</span><span class="font6"> the finishing touches were turned over to Judge W. H. Beck of the Criminal Court. Beck carried on nobly. A drunk and disorderly person who set a mattress afire was fined $5. But preaching the gospel is more serious. Thirteen of the prisoners were fined $15 each, or fifteen days in jail. De Torquemada could have made good use of Judge Beck in his day. After thirteen convictions were entered, a sudden change in proceedings was made. The authorities discovered they had hold of something they didn’t want, and the rest of the cases were dismissed without trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus has Griffin embarked on a course of religious persecution and oppression. Thus has it brought shame and dishonor to itself in the midst of a nation which has been declared by its highest court to be a Christian nation. How similar the actions of these officials to those of the Catholic judges, Catholic police, Catholic priests and their allies in New Jersey. Do their orders come from the same source?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Liberty-loving people of Griffin would better wake up and investigate before they find they have moved back into the times of the Inquisition. Atlanta and Thomaston, Ga., have temporarily fallen into the same Jesuit trap.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark186"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>Report from Palestine</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE German pioneer Georg Ritter, now in Jerusalem, Palestine, who, with exception of several months of sickness, has for two years been engaged in the pioneer work in Palestine, reports that he has covered Jaffa, Tel-Aviv and vicinity, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He has found that the entire Jewish people there begins to awake, in spite of the numerous political and religious leaders who led them astray. Least prejudiced amongst the Jewish population are the many thousands of Jewish refugees from Germany, and it was easy to make many friends among them. But what seems necessary to help them is some literature written especially for Jews, which would make it so much easier for them to understand the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Moslems are almost unapproachable; besides, most of them are analphabets. It was easy for political agitators to incite this ignorant people against the Jewish colonists and make them idolize Hitler and to expect their salvation from Hitlerism. The only literature they care to read is “books from Hitler”—if they can read at all. They hate the Jews and the English and are friends of the Germans. They rebuke this German pioneer for his association with Jews, and the Jews rebuke him for his association with Arabs. Both parties think it is treason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The worst are the “Christian” Arabs. They are spiritually and economically serfs of the fifty different religious sects, especially of the Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant organizations. Most of those Arabs sharply refuse to accept the truth literature, apparently fearing they might lose the material benefits of their affiliation with “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other people mistake him for a missionary; and the missionaries in Palestine are hated and despised as parasites. Ritter reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“A few days ago I testified to the various consulates. The Austrian and the Abyssinian consuls took books. The Abyssinian is a very nice fellow; he was very much interested and took nine books and six booklets in English. At present I am working in Bethlehem. The people here are very unapproachable. All that they are interested in is to sell to the tourists all kinds of trumpery stuff. The whole swindle reminds me of that trade with the idols of Diana in Ephesus, mentioned in Acts 19. How much I wish a greater testimony could be given here. Maybe later the radio could also be used. Soon a radio station will start operation in Jerusalem. A pioneer has a harder life in Palestine than in Europe. There the people willingly contribute for the literature they receive; but here most people wish to receive literature entirely free, which, of course, I cannot do at length, since living expenses are steadily increasing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Jersey Courts of Peculiarity</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N Jersey City Bishop Francis Borszewski, pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of St. Stephen the Martyr, struck Mrs. Celia Gartow-ski in the eye because she called on him with a complaint about his organist, who happened to be Mrs. Gartowski’s husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mrs. Gartowski sued the bishop for the decoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The case came up for trial before Judge Sa-turnewicz, and he found the bishop guilty of striking Mrs. Gartowski.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this judge was peculiarly kind and considerate. The bishop was not punished. All he received was a suspended sentence and a gentle reproof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That was very peculiar, wasn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Irvington, New Jersey, Clara Schneider was found “guilty” by Judge Thomas J. Holler-an of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom to two Irvington residents at their homes. She received a fine of $100, and her sentence was not suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, wasn’t that peculiar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And when you compare that peculiar decision with Judge Saturnewicz’s peculiar judgment, what conclusion can you reach?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer: That Romanists are out to stand by one another and kill off all real protesters. That, however, is not so peculiar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Like Father, Like Son”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">ALK about the gall of the short weight artists of Canada: when Congress was investigating the A&amp;P, a man masquerading under the name of an investigating company, who was actually in the pay of the A&amp;P, applied to the committee for the job of investigating the A&amp;P and other chain stores. He did not get the job. It was brought out at the hearings that on fresh meats A&amp;P get | percent which no others get, because they buy in larger quantities. In the case of Babbitt’s goods, if three different wholesalers buy each year 7,500 cases they receive a quantity allowance of $3,375, but if the A&amp;P buys the same number of cases of goods, the quantity allowance is $18,000, or over five times as much. And so the Devil's policy of making the rich richer and the poor poorer goes merrily on—down the toboggan that will end with Armageddon.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>The Kingdom of Usam</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N THE ancient kingdom of Usam the domestic virtues were highly prized. Men were expected to love their wives. Children were expected to honor their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certain persons in the kingdom of Usam were most particularly determined that men should love their wives, that children should honor their parents. They went down to the capital of their nation and in the holy name of love to wives and honor to parents they demanded a law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This law provided that whenever they came within six feet of each other a husband must kiss his wife. Also it provided that whenever it came within six feet of its parents a child must fall on its knees, elevate its hands and cry “Hail! honored parent”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law seemed amiable and it was enacted. Thereafter the sound of smacking lips filled all the land. Husbands were kissing their wives as the law required. And from all directions arose the voice of youth. “Hail! parent,” it was crying from bended knee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There came in the course of a little time a cloud over the sky of all Usam. The smacking went on as before; the kneeling and the “Hail! parent” ceased not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But it was observed that tens of thousands of husbands, as they kissed their wives with their lips slapped them in the face with their hands. It was observed, too, that the good wives slapped back with equal zeal. And now and then it was a fist, and not an open hand, that dealt the blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also, parents began to appear with ghastly bumps the size of hens’ eggs on their heads. Dutiful youth, kneeling as the law required and crying “Hail! parent” as it knelt, had come to casting snowballs and stones at the object of their obeisance as they paid their devotion as the law required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So there was the whole nation of Usam— husbands kissing their wives as if they loved them and slapping them in the face as if they hated them, and children kneeling to their parents as if they revered them and smashing them with snowballs as if they despised them. Appalled, the parliament of Usam met in special session to consider what to do. An eminent psychologist was called to psychoanalyze the plight. He heard the story and answered on the spot. “Oh, you dumbbells of Usam,” he said, “know you not that you cannot make men or even children love by law?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Know you not,” he went on, “that only in freedom can love exist, that when law comes in at the window love goes out at the door?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the parliament of Usam quickly repealed the law compelling men to kiss their wives, requiring children to pay obeisance to their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thereupon, men kissed their wives less, children knelt to their parents no more, but now men loved their wives more and children had reverence for their parents no less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But even after that there were members of the parliament of Usam who thought it would be a fine thing to insure love of country in Usam by compelling every citizen to salute the flag on sight on pain of a broken head.—Dayton (Ohio) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Neus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">I know a college professor who, during the last presidential campaign, placed on the blackboard before his class in social science the main planks of the republican, democratic, socialist and communist platforms. He did not tell them that those were the party platforms. He numbered them “No. 1”, “No. 2,” “No. 3,” and “No. 4”. Then he called for a discussion and debate of the principles set forth. After that he had them vote their choice. Platform “No. 4’’ received the greatest number of votes of the students; that was communism. “No. 3,” socialism, received the next highest; “No.2,” the democratic platform, came in for a bad third; and poor “No. 1”, the republican, was nearly left out altogether. When the students were then told how they had actually voted, when names of parties had been thrown aside, they were much surprised, and some were astonished. There are at this moment more people living under some imperfect form of socialism than there are living under other systems.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE difference between Judge Rutherford and Roman Catholic Bishop McAuliffe, of Hartford, Connecticut, is that Judge Rutherford is a man. And that is quite a difference, when one comes to think of it. Judge Rutherford does not wear lace petticoats nor act like one of these indeterminate things that do. If Bishop McAuliffe, of Hartford, talked over the radio until he was blue in the face, do you suppose Judge Rutherford would try to get him off the air? Not on your life. Judge Rutherford is a man. But when Judge Rutherford lectured over a world-wide broadcast, telling all people the vital truths about the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that they must now know, it was too much for McAuliffe, and he and five other priests and a Roman Catholic attorney all called up station WELI and scared the latter into putting the Watch Tower programs off the air. There is not another class of men on God’s green earth small enough or mean enough or contemptible enough to do such a thing. Thank God, the judge is still a man, and these other things—oh, what’s the use? Who knows what anybody is who wears lace petticoats above size 15 brogans ? The petticoat fraternity in New Orleans is just as small and just as contemptible as in Hartford. The same things were done as in Connecticut. The ‘girls’ in lingerie cannot stand the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark218"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>Obedience Retains the Heavenly Favor</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. ’ ’—John 14: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE greatest blessing that can come to any creature is to have the great and ever-blessed Jehovah God deign to acknowledge his humble heart. If the heart is not humble He will not do so. If it does not remain humble He will not continue to show His favor. Obedience and humility travel hand in hand; if one is present, so is the other. To be obedient one must be humble (1 Peter 5:5,6); to be humble one must make an earnest effort to obey God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same chapter that tells us of the birth of the New Nation says: “Thus saith [Jehovah], The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith [Jehovah]: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”— Isaiah 66:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The plain inference is that the great Jehovah God deigns to acknowledge the heart of the poor and contrite of spirit, as also is implied in the assurance that “[Jehovah] is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit”.—Psalm 34:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not despise.” (Psalm 51:17) “For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” —Isaiah 57:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not in heaven that Jehovah God revives the spirit of the humble and the contrite; it is here and now. There will be no need to revive the spirit of the humble and contrite ones when they are themselves possessors of life in all its fullness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.” (Isaiah 43:2,3) One thinks instinctively of the form of the fourth that was with Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in the fiery furnace. He was like the Son of God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>Paul Before the Council</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Saul of Tarsus was as honestly desirous to do the will of God when he was on the way to Damascus, “breathing out threatenings and slaughter,” as he was years later when he stood before the same council at Jerusalem that had brought about the death of Jesus, whom he had in the meantime accepted as his Lord and Master. All he needed was instruction; but he was at all times obedient to what he believed to be the will of God, and it was because of that obedience that he received the help from on high that in his case was necessary to make him a comfort to the brethren, and not a curse. The account of his tragic meeting with the council follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ? And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest? Then said Paul [his eyes not having recovered from the blinding vision on the road to Damascus], I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God. And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle. And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. —Acts 23:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">APKit 8, 1936 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>T/te</sub> qoLDEN </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">AQE</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>Jesus Stood by Him</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In the way that he handled himself in the foregoing emergency Paul showed his legal training, yet was absolutely loyal and faithful to his own Lord and Master, his own High Priest, of whom he wrote such wonderful things in Hebrews, chapters 3 to 8 inclusive. It was not the time or place to tell those riotous scribes and Pharisees that their high priest was no longer God’s high priest. They thought so; let them continue to think so, for the present; they would not have accepted his opinion anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was also perfectly proper for him to make a separation of those who believed the Word of God and those who did not, and to own a measure of companionship with the former. It resulted as he expected, and as the Lord arranged. Quite likely it was one of God’s holy angels that caused him to say, “Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.” It was the truth, and an opportune time to tell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyway, the Lord knew that Paul counted not his life dear to himself; knew that he had given a splendid witness for Him, recorded in the 22d chapter of Acts, and knew He could use him for a yet further witness at Rome, the center of the civilization of that time. And He stood by him, much the same as a worth-while host would stand by his guest in a time of peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through His angel, on a later occasion, in a time of shipwreck, the Lord also stood by Paul, saying: “Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.”—Acts 27: 23, 24.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>An Ironclad Agreement to Murder</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Paul’s situation at Jerusalem was critical even after he had, for the moment, been rescued from the group that desired to have his life. His experiences for the next few days make an interesting and exciting story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded [themselves] together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. [Sounds like Jersey justice, doesn’t it?] And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. Now, therefore, ye, with the council, signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him. And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath a certain thing to tell him. So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; and provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.—Acts 23:12-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The murderers were foiled. And how easy it was for the angels of God to upset all the Devil’s plans, when they had back of them all power in heaven and in earth. It all looked so simple in the first place. The murderers had made a perfect trap, so they thought. They would not eat nor drink till they had rid the earth of the one they most hated. It must have been fun for the angels to watch them, first one and then another, taking their first drink of water, and finally their first meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The angels took no chances. More than forty men were in the conspiracy to kill Paul. But more than ten times that many acted as his escort to a place of safety, and helped him forward on his journey to Rome, too. The cavalcade that set out from Jerusalem for Caesarea had at least 472 men in the party, with a beast of burden for each. They started at nine o’clock at night; the next morning they were far on their 60-mile journey, and no doubt stopped and had a good breakfast which they were bound to share with their distinguished prisoner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">witnesses in the spring of 1918. There is not a reasonable doubt that the little company that was shipped off to Atlanta prison would have been slain had they remained at liberty. Public feeling had been whipped into a frenzy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some were certain the Germans would come and capture America. The night sentence was passed on Judge Rutherford and his comrades the lights in the Statue of Liberty were darkened for the first time since the statue was erected. The papers said Jehovah’s witnesses were in touch with Germany by radio. There was not a syllable of truth in the accusation, but people who wish to kill somebody do not wish truth; what they wish is untruth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the time came for transfer from Brooklyn to Atlanta the witnesses were guests of the United States Government, taken in a Government van to the railway station, watched by Government guards, one for each man, and safely landed where their enemies could not reach them. Is not this just like the Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul was obedient to the truth as fast as it was disclosed to him. He had no other ambition than to be absolutely true to God. As a consequence God showed His smile of favor to this honest and unselfish man. In time of trouble He was there with the limitless forces of His organization to see that Paul’s opportunities for witnessing were enlarged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this has been true of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1918 and since. Being called before kings and rulers is often their privilege. Prison sentences are frequent. God’s true people suffer with their comrades in Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Japan, Germany, Russia, Austria, Quebec, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Ohio and California, and they suffer especially when their little ones suffer, but, oh, how the Lord makes up for it all!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>One of the “Kingdom Schools”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">One could wish that every reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> could see the beautiful environment in which 12 of the little ones that were expelled from Pennsylvania schools are receiving instruction from a thoroughly competent teacher at Andreas, Pennsylvania. The youngsters are in a big stone house. The two best rooms in the house are transformed into a schoolroom, where perfect order is maintained. There is a big flag on the wall, but the pupils do not worship it; they worship God. Asked the question, What is the most important thing any person ever learns? back came the answer, “To love God with all the heart, mind, soul and strength.” Asked what is the next most important thing any creature ever learns? back came the answer, “To go out in the service work,” “To love one’s neighbor as one’s self,” which answers at the same time from two little folks express the same thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These little folks are out in the midst of an ideal country. Their parents drive 20 miles to get them and bring them home Friday night, and then take them hack to school early Monday morning. Where they now are they are not abused; their teacher is one of Jehovah’s witnesses; their parents are happy; the children are happy; they are on God’s side, and they know it; they took their stand for God in a time and place where it required moral stamina. They were expelled, but expelled into greater happiness than they ever before experienced. That is the way Jehovah God does with those who have experienced the great joy of God’s favor, His smile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Obedience retains the heavenly favor; let it be hoped that these little ones, now so happy in the Lord, so conscious that their course has the divine approval, may retain their happiness forever. To see their bright faces was an inspiration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fall Styles at Cleveland</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE fall style show at Cleveland was quite a success, but not financially, because the harried merchants were not so enthusiastic about paying for the Catholic fandango as was expected. For one thing, the prices were too high. Still the show itself was good. The archbishop of New York, Pat Hayes, was “resplendent in vestments of scarlet and gold”. “On the stage all was white and gold, scarlet and purple,” but there was nothing green for Pat. ‘Under a canopy of gold cloth, on a white altar, was the cardinal’s golden miter and his gold and red missal. On a white side altar, under a veil and burse, was the' pope’s chalice, but the cardinal’s golden crozier leaned against the big altar.’ “To the left of the altar almost 150 archbishops and bishops, archabbots and abbots, constituted a solid block of gleaming purple.” The archjanitors and archhodcarriers were not in on this, but helped to pay for it. “Directly in front were 400 monsignori in their purple mantellattas and black birettas.” Oh but they did look nice! All the girls are just burning up with jealousy. “Behind them sat priests of every order, Franciscans in brown cassocks and cowls, Dominicans, Passionists, Trinitarians in cream-colored garb,” and that’s all for now, Mabel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Did He Bless the Kitchen Utensils?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HEN La Maisonette Russe night club was opened in Hotel St. Regis, New York city, the “Reverend” Vasily Kurdiumoff, Greek Catholic priest, spent a half hour “blessing” the musicians, the waiters and others who will work there. “Reverend” Kurdiumoff wore a “blue brocade riza”, so it seems; and if you don’t know what a riza is, well, then, you are ignorant, and have lots of company. The word doesn’t appear in the dictionary, but it must be something nice or it wouldn’t be brocaded. All the girls are wearing them now, and blue is the going color. The account goes on to say that the helpers, one by one, were sprinkled with “holy water” and that “Spiridon Ignatovich, who will act as principal chef and who formerly worked in the Czar’s summer palace in the Crimea, received the ‘blessing’ dressed in his white chef’s uniform”. Now just a question or two. Were the kitchen utensils “blessed”? Are they of aluminum?

Get these two now for yourself, or get them for your friends. Jehovah, the true God, is doing a mighty work in the earth. The time draws near for the final conflict. Which will you choose, RICHES or RUIN?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font11">N SUNDAY May 3, 1936, 381 Catholic churches in the New York diocese united in “prayer for the persecuted people” of the world, which was all the more remarkable because the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is more responsible for the bitter persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the earth than all other influences put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the same day that these prayers to the Devil were being offered in New York and vicinity, 49 of Jehovah’s witnesses were being stoned and arrested in Hazleton and Mauch Chunk, Pa., for taking the message of God’s kingdom to the homes of the people, encouraging them to look forward to the happy days when there will be no Devil to deceive the people and no Hierarchy to do his will in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Mauch Chunk the tools of the Hierarchy were so eager to get Jehovah’s witnesses into trouble that they arrested them illegally on Sunday (which can</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Universal Prayers for the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here we have Bishop Ealph Hayes, rector of the American college in Eome, dressed in his fireman’s uniform. His purgatorial highness made the headlines by hailing Ambrose as the pope of peace. The former bishop of Montana threw aside all restraint and in his usual flowery and romantic style, unembarrassed by facts or figures (magnanimously forgetting the papal twins Mussolini and Hitler), literally plastered the pope with pious platitudes. But he saved the best for last. “Not only Catholics, but Protestants, Jews and peoples of no creed—all men who love peace, justice and charity—may well join in the official prayers of the church for the supreme pontiff. ‘May the Lord preserve Pope Pius XI, give him life and make him blessed and the earth deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.’ ” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> readers, knowing who are his enemies, will benefit gastronomically—a good laugh aids digestion.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">of the county was out of town at the time. When he came home he demanded the commitment papers, which could not be legally issued on Sunday, and not finding them, opened the doors and told the witnesses to go free. A comical answer to the prayers in the New York diocese.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Universal Prayers for the Pope</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Bishop Hayes, formerly of Montana, but now of Rome, wants everybody to pray for the pope. Within a few days after his request mobs were setting fire to churches, monasteries and convents all over Spain, shouting, “Burn all the pope’s property.” More than thirty convents and churches were burned. Liberal papers in Spain stated that professional agitators did the firing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Isn’t it a trifle inconsistent to want people to pray for the pope whose very lives are in danger because there is a pope ? If the pope wants others to pray for him he should at The Orangeman's prayer “To hell with the pope’’ is the only general prayer for the pope that will receive any favorable action in the place where favor is worth while.—Psalm 55:15.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11">least backtrack on this idea that as soon as the Catholic church is strong enough it proposes to take the lives of all the other people in the world. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">579</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">The Sydney </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Herald</span><span class="font11"> of October 22 reports receipt by the Catholic publication </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Australian Messenger</span><span class="font11"> of a cable from the pope asking for prayers for something special he has on his mind. Whatever it was it was something the pope did not wish to broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The pope closed the &quot;holy year” with a prayer. It was not a prayer to the Father in secret, as Jesus instructed, but it was a prayer broadcast over the radio, addressed to the virgin Mary, and intended for the newspapers. The principal receiving apparatus was in the land of Magog. —Ezekiel .‘IS: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the strength of the prediction of a fortune teller the pope expects he will live until he is 93. The pope's Easter candle was eight feet high and three inches thick. The report does not mention the size and number of his Easter eggs and Easter bunnies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A Zurich paper says that Ambrose likes to have them step on the gas and move right along down the pike when he goes riding on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays in his plain Fiat car. On Wednesdays he takes another Fiat car, No. 521, but the public is left in deep distress to know which car he takes on Thursdays and Sundays. He has three others, for use on these days, but three cars do not divide up into two days, nohow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Vatican, by the way, has'250 autos for the little city's 716 inhabitants, which is a record of one chariot for every three persons. The United States comes next, with one for every five. The Vatican cars bear the initials SCV to indicate that they are from the Sovrana Citta del Vatican©.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first ten cars have red figures on a white background and are for the personal use of the pope and his retinue. The car that the pope likes best has an easy chair in the back, instead of an ordinary seat. Angelo Stroppa has been his chauffeur for twelve years.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Do Men Like Lace Petticoats?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Do men like lace petticoats'? Do they? Does a cat like cream ? As a matter of fact all the men are jealous of the girls on this lace business. Here is a picture of seven priests out in front of St. Bernard's church, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Three of them are dressed in as nice lace petticoats as you ever saw, and all the fellows are just burning up over it. The men have always had to buy the lace and let the girls wear it, while they dress in ugly pants and go around looking like old-fashioned clothespins, instead of dollies, as they might, if they would all go into the priest business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A clipping from New Zealand discloses that only certain girls may wear purple. It took a bishop, a dean and a common or garden variety of priest to confer this right on H. F. Holbrook, Roman Catholic parish priest of Grey Lynn, New Zealand. Lots of the girls will be jealous now. But some of them, with the wrong kind of complexion, will just turn up.their noses in a curt way, and say that they never did like purple, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The girls of Texas put one over on their northern sisters that will be the talk of dressmakers for months to come. In April, at Galveston, there was a huge celebration in charge of the Most Reverend C. E. Byrne, bishop of Galveston. The women's page bristled with this information: “Bishop Byrne has ordered white silk vestments, hand embroidered with Texas bluebonnets, for the ministers who celebrate the mass. The vestments will be trimmed in gold.” Now won't that make the northern ladies turn green with envy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Concerning the winter style show at Vatican City the papers say: “Priests and prelates in gold and silver vestments, in black, white, red and purple robes, will gather around the kneeling cardinals. They will form a rainbow of color in a vast mass of black worn by the tens of thousands'” of plain mutts that pay for the show. The girls certainly do love to climb into glittering harness and put it all over on the plain men-folks.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Without Honor or Decency</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Of the full-length prostration of the batch of new cardinals before the pope, the account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘’Two prelates waved fans of ostrich feathers at tire papal throne when the pope took his seat there at the altar, while the papal anthem ‘Tu es Petrus’ was played. The ceremony of adoration was carried out. Each member of the College of Cardinals passed before the pope and kissed his papal ring. The new cardinals were led by older ones to the throne where they knelt .and kissed the pope’s red-slippered foot, his ring and embraced him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then they got their red hats and fell headlong,</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">After changing her &quot;religion” from Episcopalian to Roman Catholic, and living with Alfonso king of Spain for thirty years, in which time she bore him six children, Victoria, granddaughter of Queen Victoria, without any hearing, was adjudged by old man Ratti's so-called ‘‘Rota” as never married to her husband at all. Of course, this “decision” of the Rota is entirely without honor, entirely without reason, entirely without justice and entirely without decency, and without force. It is merely a decision of the Roman Hierarchy, which is, in fact, a decision of the Devil himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Here is a little book, intended for circulation among American Negroes, entitled “Blessed Martin” and bearing the words “Imprimatur Jacobus Josephus Episcopus Columbensis”, meaning that it has the official endorsement of the Roman Catholic bishop of Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Page 5 says: “Whenever reviled, he would thank his persecutors for their interest in him, beg pardon for his faults and promise to do better in the future. With this he was wont to kiss their feet.” The book does not show who the re-vilers were, but everybody knows the gang that like to have their feet kissed, and so can guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The next page says: “Even rats shared his attention and benefited by his kindness. When they were going to be destroyed in the convent he came to their rescue by sending one of them to gather the rest and lead them into the garden. There he fed them, happy to have prevented the suffering of even the least of God’s creatures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico have rites and ceremonies so savage that the penalty for disclosing them is burial alive at night.

The sacred thing about it was the sacred bulls, of which there were four, white ones, with golden hoofs. They drew the cart.

<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Plc:,'.ng the Ignorant for Suckers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Having clone, and still continuing to do, all that is humanly possible to keep the people in ignorance of God and His Word, the Roman Hierarchy makes no bones whatever of playing the public for suckers by methods that are not one particle higher than those of the medicine men of Borneo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">St. Joseph's House, 16th St. and Allegheny Ave., Philadelphia, sent Jake Mayer a Cord of St. Joseph 37 inches long, to be tied around his waist and to make him innocent. Jake's waist was too big for the 37-inch cord, so he sent it on here. The cord won't do for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age; </span><span class="font11">not at all. The knots are not evenly spaced: the distances apart, from knot to knot, are respectively 1-5/32 inches, 1-5/1G inches, 1-3/16 inches, 1-17/32 inches, 1-5/16 inches and 1-3/8 inches, and you can immediately see for yourself they would be of no good for an editor to get made innocent. The cord is common grocery cord, approved by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, 1859, and enriched by Pius IX. Don’t betray your ignorance by asking how it was enriched ; it is enough for you to know it was enriched. But it is of no good in here. Even the secretary won’t wear it; and besides, he couldn’t get it on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Twelve times, for various reasons, the “Society of the Divine Word, St. Paul’s Mission House, Epworth, Iowa”, said, “Go to Joseph,” stating that this invitation is “from Jesus”. The statement is wholly false. Jesus made no such request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A Manitoba business man relates that when he was a lad in eastern Canada the priest told that when the church bell rang it could be heard in Rome. Doubting this, the lad, a good stone thrower, got on the opposite side of the church and threw rocks at the bell to make it ring, so he could judge how far the sound would go. One of the rocks hit the bell. The priest came running out and told the people that an angel had rung the bell and they were all to kneel down and pray. The businessman said be never had any more use for the hypocrites from that moment.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Seizure of the Press</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Whenever there is a fire or a flood or anything else, it has been observed, the most conspicuous personage is always a Catholic priest if there is one within reach. Thus, in the account of the rescue of passengers from the Dixie, which went on the reef below Miami, one of the four headlines was “Priest Clung to One Place and Prayed for Five Hours, Giving Absolution”, and then halfway down the column under the subhead “Priest First Passenger”, the same story is given all over again, and it is explained that next to the purser he was the first to get away from the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Anything at all that helps to keep the Roman Catholic church in the public eye (like a cinder) is considered a great gain to the church. The news associations do all possible to help carry forward this idea, as do editors and reporters. Where Rome is involved, the truth is murdered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A friend in Massachusetts belabored diligently in the Berkshire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle</span><span class="font11"> and the North Adams </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Transcript,</span><span class="font11"> in which, as usual, he was represented as trying to hand out copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> “to discourage the school children from saluting the flag”, sends in copies of the papers, and says: “As I am the representative spoken of, it is very amusing to me. Hardly a word of truth is spoken in either article.” One of the cudgel-wielders said, “I am a Catholic.” But that was quite unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A dispatch from Manila tells of the death of two children and the injury of twenty-seven more when a Roman Catholic church burned in the Philippines, but somebody fell down on the job very badly, for in the dispatch there was no mention of some priest or nuns that made heroic rescues, etc. The Roman Cult should look into this and see to it that no more truthful accounts be sent out from the Philippines. Nothing should be sent out until the truth is so twisted and mutilated to suit the purposes of the Hierarchy that nobody familiar with the facts would ever recognize it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Zeppelin designer and navigator, Dr. Hugo Eckener, was man enough to refuse to vote for Hitler; hence Hitler ordered that his name be not hereafter mentioned in Germany. The publicity, as far as that was humanly possible, was transferred from Eckener to the pope, in the following manner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Having pushed the Protestant Eckener aside, the pope graciously “consented” (stop your laughing) that the “Reverend Paul Schulte, flying padre&quot;, should go to Friedriehshaven “bringing with him a papal document authorizing the celebration of mass aboard the Hindenburg”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Schulte did not pay his fare. Not on your life. He was not listed among the 50 passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He was on the pay roll as one of the crew. Do you think the Hierarchy has any intentions whatever of paying for its own publicity? If you do, you just don’t know the Hierarchy. It took the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> almost a column to spread out this slop, but Fascism is willing to do anything whatever to help forward the scheme of the Devil, and Gog, his prime minister, and the pope, his vicar, to gain control of the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One comical thing happened in New York. The radio announcer Mark Harley said, “One of the features of the trip will be the 'daily mess’ by Father Schulte.” He quickly, and confusedly, made the change from “mess” to “mass”; but he might as well have let it stand. In any event, it is simon-pure idolatry, and idolatry is a mess of superstitions—nothing else.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>“Their Reward”—Gratified Vanity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">The Lord spoke about those that love to pray in the synagogues and other places so as to be seen of men, and said of them, 'Verily they have “their reward” ’—gratified vanity. And now cometh the newspaper story that at a convent fire in Providence, Rhode Island, thirteen nuns “calmly completed mass” for nine minutes while four companies of firemen were fighting the blaze. Then they walked out—and 'verily they have “their reward” ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Commomveal</span><span class="font11"> boasts of how the Hierarchy prevents freedom of the press in the Protestant state of Georgia. If there is a hint of disclosing any unfavorable facts regarding the “church” there are immediately letters from various Catholic associations, threats of reader boycotts, advertising cancellations, suit and bribery. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonweal</span><span class="font11"> does not mention any of these, for they are regular practices in every state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Georgia a different scheme was used. A woman criticized the church and set forth some truth. A Catholic organization replied by a paid advertisement. When the woman sought to make a response she was referred to the advertising columns, which she could not afford to patronize. So, by one means or another, the Hierarchy proceeds in every land to stifle education and free speech—its definite objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Beginning to sense the danger to themselves if radio censorship, which is gradually being introduced, becomes an accomplished fact, the newspaper publishers of the United States have adopted a resolution protesting against such violations of the First Amendment to the Constitution. They have been rather slow in waking up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the Devil managing “Christendom”, one of the most unpleasing of persons is he who corrects errors. Writing on this subject The Davey Company, in a piece of advertising literature, says: “Robert Etienne, 16th Century Parisian publisher, first divided the New Testament into verses. He did this while riding on horseback between Paris and Lyons. Robert made the error of correcting errors in the French translation. The medieval churchmen became indignant at this apparent blasphemy. Robert barely escaped with his hide to Geneva. This ancient book craftsman made the error of knowing too much.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Seizure of the Movies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">American films are now completely subject to the pope. An INS dispatch from Rome tells of the reception by the pope of Clyde Pettijohn, general counsel of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. Pettijohn has been working under the direction of Cardinal Mundelein, of Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">N. B. Maysmith, British Columbia, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An investigation of Hollywood film releases during the past year will show that </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">all</span><span class="font10"> films, where it was possible to depict religion as an upbuilding and helpful influence, have shown the Catholic church and its priests or nuns. If it was found necessary to ridicule religion it was always the Protestant churches and preachers that were used. Sueh pictures as Dante’s “Inferno” are ideal for putting over an abundance of propaganda thinly veiled as entertainment. News reels are used to show scenes of cardinals and bishops, of eucharistic congresses and various Catholic ceremonies. In many productions, such as Shanghai, Catholic scenes are introduced which are entirely foreign to the natural setting of the scene, and which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font10">evidently inserted in the script </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font10"> it was written. In “Steamboat Round the Bend”, Will Rogers’ last picture, there is a scene ridiculing an “evangelist” and his teachings, but this scene depicts a Protestant preacher. Historical films, which to be true to fact should show the hypocrisy and evil works of the Catholic church, are so changed as to glorify this devilish system. True, the propaganda, in some instances, is very subtle, as in a hospital scene, where nuns are shown walking in the corridors, implying that it is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">Catholic hospital, although there is nothing in the picture to suggest that any of the characters are Catholics. In another film a young man seeking comfort in mental distress enters a Catholic church and kneels before the altar. These individual instances are of themselves of little importance, but the continuous depicting of Catholicism as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font10"> helpful church influence is bound to have its effect eventually, not only on the impressionable child mind, but also on the mature mind of the adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">George Bernard Shaw, famous London playwright, found himself greatly shocked to discover that Will Hays is really under the dictation of the Vatican and “that Avhat professed to he an American Purity League was really a Roman Catholic censorship actually dictated by the Vatican”. George should read </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> and keep up to date. This was brought to attention of these readers long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Catholic censorship of films is under way even in the supposedly Protestant city of Geneva, Switzerland. The parochial notice board lists all the movies in the city, and marks them TARM according to what films may be seen or not seen, and by whom. Below the list are the significant words, “To live is to choose.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Believe as I Believe, or Else—</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">One of Jehovah’s witnesses, a former Catholic, sent </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> a letter from his sister, still an ardent Catholic, urging his return to the “prison” from which he escaped. One of her arguments was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I belong to a study club, organized by Catholic Action. The purpose of these clubs is to expose just such raeketeers in religion as is this man you have so much faith in, namely, Judge Rutherford. If Rutherford had lived in Europe, in the great Catholic countries of Italy and Austria, or in the Lutheran countries of Denmark and Norway, or in Presbyterian and Episcopalian England, he would not be here today— his evil tongue would have been silenced long ago.” . . . ‘ ‘ If Rutherford would live up to the golden rule, I am sure the number of his present followers would be doubled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How is that for an argument ? In one sentence is a covert threat of murder, and in another a plea that the one who would escape murder at the hands of his supposedly Christian enemies must make sure that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font11"> lives up to the golden rule or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font11"> will get it where Anna wears her beads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is the attitude fostered by the Roman church, though in his public utterances the pope is often “moved to tears” while his voice “trembles with emotion”. At the recent congress in Rome of the International Federal Cinemato-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Compare the Address, the Handwriting, and the Signature </span><span class="font11">(See page 587) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JGs*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For reasons best known to himself this gentleman (?)—and who but a member of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy would stoop to such a thing? —did not want “his” flock to get Judge Rutherford’s address for fear they would learn the truth about how they have been swindled and oppressed. But he wanted some truth himself, and got it, too. And to make sure the flock would know all about it, his three-page letter marked “a” was put in 400,000 homes in Philadelphia and Camden. Two days afterward the gentleman whose name is Dennis (referred to in letter on page 588) left in a hurry for Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">graphic Press he cried because the movies were so terrible, and reminded those present that he was “the father of all souls”, thereby intimating that he was the one to set the standard of what was to be presented on the screen. In the United States, which is admittedly the greatest center of film production, the pope grabbed everything, as has been shown, and is having things his own way. What more does he want?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Attempted Seizure of Radio</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">All readers of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> know of the desperate attempts made by the Catholic press of America (the pope’s own voice, so he says) to crowd Judge Rutherford off the air, and that by methods that would have been a disgrace to use at a dog fight. Intimidation, boycott, threats, slander and misrepresentation were freely resorted to. The attempt was unsuccessful, less than thirty stations capitulating out of more than three hundred attacked. The Roman Hierarchy, however, once started on any course of infamy, is very persistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">John F.

<p><span class="font11">Radio station WBBR, Brooklyn, N. Y., for a considerable period carried a weekly program by an excellent Hungarian orchestra, featuring the native folk music of that music-loving people. With the support of the Hungarian newspapers that orchestra attained unusual popularity among the Hungarian people, their fan mail amounting to thousands of letters. At length WBBR followed their broadcast with a Hungarian translation of Judge Rutherford’s lecture “G overnment”. The results were immediate and most gratifying.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Applying the whitewash brush via radio is more to the Hierarchy’s liking. For instance, President Roosevelt, in a message delivered for him over the NBC network, seemed to give Myles Coverdale a place in the Roman fold when his translation of the Bible took place. He was described by the president as “an Augustinian friar, later the bishop of Exeter”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a matter of fact Coverdale laid aside his monk’s habit in 1525, and began to preach against papal errors. He joined Tyndale at Hamburg in 1528, and his own translation of the Bible w<sup>r</sup>as published in 1535, ten years after he had ceased to be a Roman Catholic. But, of course, the Hierarchy and its friends are not interested in giving the people the facts, or in using the radio as a means of giving the people truthful information. It is to be used as far</span></p>

This information comes to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> from a person once in the Government’s employ, and is evidently correct.

<h3><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Seizure of Schools Under Way</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Rome seeks to control education all over the world. What she would do if she had the control is exemplified by what she has done where she has had it. The following are the percentages of illiteracy in the countries where Rome has had full sway: Argentina 62, Bolivia 40, Brazil 75, Chile 40, Colombia 60, Costa Rica 47, Cuba 52, Dominican Republic 70, Guatemala 65, Haiti 58, Mexico 62, Nicaragua 40, Panama 38, Peru 46, Puerto Rico 66, Salvador 55, Uruguay 39, Venezuela 72.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fascism (Catholic Action) looks to the slavery of the masses, with all power in the hands of a few. This is frankly admitted by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic World,</span><span class="font11"> -which is on record as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Wc do not indeed prize as highly as some of our countrymen seem to do the simple ability to read, write, and cipher. The best ordered and administered State is that in which a few are well educated and ead, and the many are trained to obedience, arc willing-to be directed, content to follow, and do not aspire to be leaders. We believe the peasantry in old Roman Catholic countries two centuries ago were better educated, although for the most part unable to read and write, than are the great body of the American people of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It ought to be perfectly apparent from this admission that Theodore Roosevelt knew just what he was talking about when he said that the Roman Catholic church is not suited to American principles and ideals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Toronto </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Et'ening Telegram</span><span class="font11"> Kate Dowling, referring to the so-called parochial schools of the Hierarchy, said, ‘It is impossible to name any other one thing that has created as much strife and ill-will in Ontario as Roman Catholic separate schools. . . . There is an abundance of evidence to prove that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will never abide by any contract or settlement they accept for very long. They will always be back very soon with fresh demands.” Suppose every one of the 207 sects in the United States should demand a slice of the public funds for separate schools, as does the Roman Catholic sect. All can see the confusion that would result. The big dogs would get it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Roman Hierarchy is making strenuous efforts to prevent the facts of history from being known by the rising generation. It is noteworthy that in every possible place Catholics are being made teachers of “history”—even at Harvard University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Mexico other methods are resorted to. In Acejeme three Roman Catholics, all men, shot a woman seven times, cut her with machetes, beat her with clubs, dragged her body to the center of the town, and burned it. This was because she had championed the Mexican government’s educational program instead of the one steadfastly maintained by the church for 400 years and which resulted in 62 percent illiteracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, two of Jehovah’s witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Carlos V. Calderon, engaged in the most important educational work in the world, were going from house to house telling the poor and priest-ridden people of God’s gracious provision for them, when they were foully murdered, a Catholic priest being the one responsible for the commission of the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Catholic papers lay much stress upon a new Catholic dictionary for boys and girls. The word “Catholic” is omitted from the title, which will be “Webster Dictionary for Boys and Girls&quot;. Catholic educators are clever’ enough to know that if they are to enslave adults they must first enslave the minds of children; and what better plan exists than to poison their minds by false definitions? This works well in Christian Science, and should work in Roman Catholicism.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Educators by the Nose</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">The Roman Hierarchy has St. Paul’s (Minnesota) educators by the nose. All Catholic children must be excused forty minutes on Mondays and Tuesdays to be pumped full of Romish doctrines. This interrupts the school work altogether unnecessarily, as Saturdays and Sundays could be used for this worse than useless “instruction”. The plan makes the state back up the church, at least in appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a single county in Texas 42 Protestant schoolteachers were discharged and 42 nuns took their places. (In North Dakota nuns may wear their black habits while teaching in public schools!) The checks to pay the nuns were all made out to the Mother Superior, who retained $77.50 out of each check, allowing the nuns to retain $22.50; so says the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Texas Baptist Standard,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Fascist (Catholic Action) scheme to Hit-lerize the United States is in full swing. In twenty-two states teachers who have spent their whole lives making good Americans are now forced to take oaths to do what they have always done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So determined is the Jesuit grip on Massachusetts that in five minutes the Curley gang ousted the capable Protestant state commissioner of education, Dr. Payson Smith, after eighteen years of faithful service, all because he opposed the Fascist Teachers’ Oath Act. They then put in his place Janies G. Reardon, 36-year-old superintendent of schools in Adams, Knight of Columbus, who is, of course, for everything the pope is for. Dr. Smith is over 60 years of age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">At the moment it looks as if the efforts to make statesmen out of house painters and bus drivers is not wholly a success. Hitler, the man that sold out the liberties of the German people to the munition makers and the pope, was a house painter. Dorgan, responsible for turning the people of Massachusetts into a flagworshiping bunch of hypocrites, was a bus driver. Hitler could not have used good paint or put it on in an honest manner; that’s flat. There is still hope for Dorgan, however, as his attitude toward “flag-salutin’ ” has undergone modification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ignace Opielouski once a Roman Catholic, became one of Jehovah’s witnesses. When his three children w<sup>T</sup>ere sentenced to a reform school because they refused to salute the flag, their case was appealed to a higher court. Meantime, Attorney James F. Mahoney, representing the town, announces that, while the appeal is pending, the children may not go on with their studies. Guess Mahoney’s “religion”, and guess what “church” is back of the whole infamy. Also guess what “church” has Massachusetts right by the nose and is swinging it around in circles. Nellie Shea is the principal of the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Columbus, Georgia, placed copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> Nos. 420, 421 and 422 in the hands of all editors and school principals of the city. One of the school principals is a Roman Catholic. Immediately after the copies had been left with him he, or somebody for him, caused the publication of a front-page broadside accusing Jehovah’s witnesses with distributing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> among the school children. The principal knew this was a lie. Being a Roman Catholic, he naturally wanted to show that he is opposed to the truth. There is no need to get rattled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Let the liars lie; they are in for it now and later. No person should expect any editor who is under Catholic control to tell the truth on any subject whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Jesuit battle for control of America’s pocketbook is nearly won. Thus the Jesuit magazine </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A merica </span><span class="font11">now admits that “for the past three years the Federal Government has spent nearly $400,000 per day on schools in the States. ... In making these allotments, the Government has drawn no distinction between public and private institutions, between schools conducted by</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Catholics and schools from which religion is barred.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Perceiving, from the distribution of millions of copies of the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty,</span><span class="font11"> containing Judge Rutherford’s address on “Saluting a Flag”, and from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font11"> and the public press in general, the bitter hatred and contempt of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy engendered by the flag salute laws in the State of O’Connell, Curley and Reardon (sometimes still called “Massachusetts”), the Hierarchy now comes out strong (on paper, and for the purposes of the record), first, with a guarded declaration against free speech, and, second, with a protestation that it does not believe in making the schools the playthings of politics, nor the organs of a false patriotism, and is against teachers’ oaths of allegiance, etc. This is like a horse thief condemning horse stealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Writing of the rapid spread of the Roman church in the days when its harlotry was desired by every cutthroat that sought to make himself powerful at the expense of his fellow men, Mark Twain said, bitingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In two or three little centuries it (the Roman church) had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms. Before the day of the church’s supremacy in the world men were men, and held their heads up, and had a man’s pride and spirit and independence; and what of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement, not by birth. But then the church came to the front, with an ax to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way to skin a cat—or a nation; she invented ‘divine right of things’ and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes—wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the faculty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner, always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of earth to bow down to them and worship them. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands. From every land came monks to join; they came even as the fishes come, in shoals, and the monastery added building to building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms and took them in. And nuns came also; and more again, and yet more, and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale, and added building to building, until mighty was the nunnery. And these were friendly unto those, and they joined their loving labors together, and together they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between.—“The Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Will Rogers’ dramatization of scenes from this famous book, this and all other reflections on the Roman system were carefully eliminated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>The Coughlin Camouflage</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Referring to some unnamed but easily identified radio priest as pouring out “weekly under the blessed name of social justice the most poisonous and inflammatory economic and social nonsense&quot;, President James Rowland Angell, of Yale University, wonders w<sup>T</sup>hy the sudden demand that the teachers must all be put under loyalty oaths while such radio speakers, and editors, movie magnates and others, all of them far more powerful purveyors of propaganda, are left unscathed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Democratic ‘’statesmen’’ are working desperately to keep Coughlin's name in the paper. Thus John J. O’Connor, Roman Catholic, chairman of the House of Representatives Rules Committee, wired Coughlin: “Just heard your libelous radio rambling. The truth is not in you. You are a disgrace to my church or any other church, and especially to the citizenship of America which you recently embraced. You do not dare print what you said about me. If you will please come to Washington I shall guarantee to kick you all the way from the Capitol to the White House with clerical garb and all the silver in your pockets, which you got by speculating in Wall Street while I was voting for all farm bills. Come on.” Coughlin then said he would come, and O’Connor apologized. The net result was that Coughlin was made to appear as persecuted and heroic. It kept his name in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Father” Coughlin’s old church, insured at $30,000, burned to the ground just as his new $750,000 was in good shape to take over all the radio equipment and other accessories of the burned structure. The old church burned because the wires were crossed [though some said the Black Legion burned it]; the $30,000 will come in good, now that there are reports that Coughlin’s influence is waning. Among the things saved were, so reported, a piece of the true cross and a bone of St. Theresa. If Coughlin could get together all the pieces of the true cross that are on exhibition in various parts of the world, and could fasten them together, he could build a bigger church than the one that was burned, and have enough left over to erect a ten-story building. (This figure of speech is sometimes called hyperbole.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Adelaide (Australia) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span><span class="font11"> criticizes Coughlin as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are critics who find in his category of “Points’’ one ominous omission, the failure to include among the sixteen a single word about democratic government. Exacting critics have discovered a second omission. Liberty of conscience is conceded, but what of liberty of speech ? There is no despotism in Europe in which liberty of conscience is disallowed. Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini have magnanimously permitted the millions they dragoon to retain their thoughts as long as they keep them to themselves; but liberty of speech they have treated as another matter. It is ominous also that it is only at the cost of political freedom that these dictators establish themselves, and still maintain their despotic power (in two eases after the lapse of year’s) in spite of Rich Rumbold’s memorable declaration when, as Macaulay tells us, this political martyr stood on the scaffold in 1685, that he could “never believe that Providence had sent a few men into the world, ready booted and spurred to ride, and millions ready saddled and bridled to be ridden”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A. IT. Kent, of Iowa, demands to know:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Who is this mighty Coughlin that claims to hold eight million voters in the hollow of his hand, and covers the integrity of certain political candidates with the sanctifying influence of his priestly robes? What manner of man this, that can deliver one-fifth the nation’s voters, roped, hogtied and branded at the corral of politicians of his own choosing? Can it be that the technique of ward heelers and boodlers has become so purified at the shrine of the Little Flower that it now floats, untainted and undetected, on the sterilized air of the N.B.C.? That such things can be is the more surprising when we consider that since Barnum's time the birth rate on suckers has dropped to one every three minutes. Anyway, -we thought Coughlin himself would be the last money changer to be driven from Wall Street when China dumped her silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Baltimore </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Review</span><span class="font11"> is not proud of Coughlin’s injection of the Catholic church into politics. It asks a question from the jobseeking candidates that advertises their conversion to every one of Coughlin’s sixteen “points” and follows the question with a statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are the men who are to be elected to Congress this year to be representatives of the people of the country, or are they to be mere puppets carrying out every order issued by Father Coughlin? Conditions have reached a new high in danger when one man seeks to tell the country that not only does he know everything on a particular question, but goes beyond that and seeks to make the lawmakers acknowledge obsequiously and cowardly that he knows all and they know nothing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>No Sensible Person Wants Anarchy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is well aware of the fact that no sensible person wants anarchy. Past masters in the arts of propaganda, adepts at inflaming “public opinion” against imaginary foes, and alert in the excitement thus created to move several steps forward toward their objectives, the agents of the Hierarchy a few years back had the United States scared stiff for fear a handful of anarchists would take away the liberties of 120,000,000 Americans overnight.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Vanzetti and “Clergy in Action’*</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Vanzetti, it will be remembered, was put to death for a pay roll robbery which he was alleged to have committed in Bridgewater on the same day when 125 reputable citizens of Plymouth testified he was in Plymouth all day peddling fish from door to door. It now appears that the hue and cry that he was an anarchist (he shook hands with his executioner just before he was slain) w<sup>T</sup>as in all probability “Clergy in Action”, intended to get American sapheads too excited about an imaginary anarchist uprising to be able to use their brains w<sup>T</sup>hen the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font11"> villains, “El Clero,” should begin to pull off their stuff—the seizure of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The potential dangers to true Americanism are the tools of the pope. This time it is the express men. March 22, 1936, 2,600 employees of the Railway Express Company had a “communion mass” at St. Patrick's Cathedral, followed by a Holy Name Society breakfast at the Hotel Astor. A week later 5,000 New York police went through with a similar program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The natural effect of these procedures, first by customs employees, then by firemen, then by post office employees, then by police, then by express employees, etc., is to overawe and intimidate the non-Catholics in those organizations, and also to intimidate and overawe the public at large, making everybody think that everything in the United States is already in the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy (and it is nearly so in fact) and, that being the case, they might as well join up and go along and participate in the racket plunder to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Only two years ago the leading Roman Catholic journals -were declaring that the United States Constitution is old and decrepit and should be destroyed, so that they and Mr. Roosevelt and the NRA could do as they please with the country’s assets, and now there is a complete flip-flop. According to the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> the Roman Catholic Carroll Club, after being “blessed” by Cardinal Hayes, went on public record (always public, and as public as possible) that the Roman Catholic philosophy was the foundation of the United States Constitution, and is the bulwark of its security. Did you ever hear about the fox and the sour grapes? Well, this is the real fox, and the grapes are temporarily beyond its reach.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font11">HEN Jesus was dying, the thief, who was also being crucified, said to Jesus: “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” Note that the thief said nothing about heaven. (Luke 23:42,43) Manifestly the thief had learned that Jesus expected to receive His kingdom in due time and the thief had desired to be remembered favorably when that time should arrive. Jesus answered the thief’s request in these ■words: “I say unto thee today [at this time], Shalt thou be with me in paradise ?” Note that the answer of Jesus is also in the form of a question. When making the request the thief showed he was on the side of Jesus, and the words of Jesus are to this effect: ‘Shall you be on my side in paradise?’ If so, then the presumption will follow that Jesus would remember him favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> has no reference to heaven. The word paradise means a beautiful garden or park, that is, a glorious earthly place. Note now that Jehovah has said concerning the earth (Isaiah 60:13): “I will make the place of my feet glorious.” We know that He referred to the earth, because He also said (Isaiah 66:1): “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” God made the earth to be inhabited by perfect man who serves and obeys Him. He committed to Jesus all power in heaven and in earth. God declares His purpose to have Jesus regenerate the things of the earth and give life to those men who are fully obedient to Him. It is His purpose, as the Scriptures show, to make the earth a glorious place like unto a beautiful garden or park and to permit obedient men to dwell there for ever. That work of making the earth glorious He does during the reign of Christ Jesus as King. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> therefore means the earth made glorious by the Lord Jesus Christ after the coming of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus died and was buried and on the third day was raised out of death, and forty days later He ascended into heaven. It is certain that Jesus did not go to heaven the day that He died. The words of Jesus have been so twisted and misapplied that He is made to say that the thief should be w<sup>T</sup>ith Him in paradise the day that He did die, whereas Jesus merely asked the thief would he be on His side in paradise. The thief did not go to heaven, and never will be in heaven; but during the reign of Christ he will be awakened out of death, because the Lord declares that there shall be a resurrection of the good and the bad. (John 5:29) If the thief when awakened out of death takes his stand on the side of the Lord and fully obeys the Lord Jesus Christ then he will be with Jesus in paradise, because those who obey the Lord shall live and shall not again die. Such is positively true, because Jesus used these words, at John 11:26: “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” And at John 8: 51: “If a man keep my saying [obey me], he shall never see death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the thief died he was an unjust man, because he was and had been wicked. It is written, in Acts 24:15: “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.” Then the thief, aw<sup>T</sup>akened out of death, will have the opportunity to prove his integrity to the Lord by obeying, and if fully obedient to Christ, of course, he will then be with the Lord or on the Lord’s side and Jesus will remember him and give him life by means of regeneration. That means that the everlasting home of the thief will be on earth, and the earth, brought to a glorious condition, will be a veritable paradise. Man’s arch enemy Satan has seized upon these words of the thief to Jesus and misapplied them in order to deceive the people, but now the time has come to learn the truth and it is your privilege to fully inform yourself that you may know the right way in which to go that you may live in everlasting happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The scripture concerning the dying thief is often wrongfully cited as authority to sustain deathbed repentance and the claim that such repentant one may then be taken immediately to heaven. That thief that died 1900 years ago is still dead, and will be awakened out of death only after the kingdom of Christ is in full sway. Likewise all men who have died and repented at death are still dead and in the grave and will be awakened out of death and given opportunity to prove their faithfulness and obedience to the Lord in due time. If then such are faithful and obedient they, like the thief, will be regenerated and given life by Christ Jesus, and will dwell for ever upon the earth, the glorious footstool</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Expelled from Her Home for Loyalty to God </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By a Jw in Florida</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11"> HAVE been expelled from my home for not saluting the flag. I am the mother of three children, 10, 13 and 15 years old, two boys and a girl. My husband is a war veteran and active Legionnaire. He will not permit me to go home unless 1 salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For six years I have studied my Bible and the Watch Tower publications, and when possible I was active in house-to-house witnessing. All this time my husband opposed me in every way. He burned my books and refused to Jet me go on a camping trip with the rest of the family (and I put out more booklets that week than ever before).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Only the Devil himself could think up the mean tricks he played on me. He hid my shoes and finally took a sharp knife and cut up my coat, hat and purse to scare me into staying home from class. I got out an old jacket and my old straw hat and went anyway. In every way I have returned good for evil, and smoothed his ruffled spirits as soon as possible. I am far from perfect, hut I have remained steadfast in the truth and never was mean or cross to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He does not believe in the Bible, nor in life after death. He is very patriotic and loves to march in parades with a gun and sword or a flag. I never joined the Legion Auxiliary, as I do not enjoy being with women who smoke, drink and play cards most of the time. My husband tried every way to get me to join.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When one of my boys started kindergarten he was vaccinated with toxin-antitoxin, three shots, and was sick for five years. He got stiff all over, and so he couldn’t w<sup>r</sup>alk. We had him to many specialists and several hospitals. At University Hospital, Michigan, they stretched his feet back in position so he could walk again. I got him home and taught him to walk. He remained thin and stiff but could get around. We came to Florida, and nothing would help him, and no one knew the cause of his condition. Then he developed hard, bony lumps in all his muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A witness of Jehovah called at my home. I told her of his puzzling condition and she immediately asked, ‘Was your boy ever vaccinated 1” Then I connected the two together for the first time. He got sores on his legs and the bony lumps, and matter started running out. He got worse and worse, suffering terribly. When he was &quot;well enough to leave I’d get a friend to sit with him and I’d go out with the books and witness in streets near by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One neighbor insisted I try “Christian Science’’. I said, “Go to the Devil for help ? Never 1” I did not pray for God to heal him. That seemed a selfish prayer, as many others are ill, too. But I prayed continually, “Thy kingdom come.” He had (supposedly) only a few more days to live. The doctor told my husband to expect the end any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">My husband was down at the Legion and a woman said to go to her doctor, as he was great. My husband went and the doctor came. He left medicine and said in one week we would see an improvement; and it was so. We continued the medicine (three drops every three hours) for a year, and Jimmy got better. Today he is a fine, fat boy, but still a bit stiff and has many hard lumps in his muscles. Jimmy needs his mother to watch over him, and the younger boy had an earache and no mother at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">New Year’s night I started for Bible class. My husband said, “You go there and you never come back.” He said I was against the greatest government on earth. He said if he took a knife and cut my finger off I'd give up my beliefs quick. Said if I went to class and came back he’d give me a chance to prove if I’d give my life for what I believe. Said he’d rather go to jail for twenty years than live with me another year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I took my nightgown and went to class. My father and brother live alone. Mother died of cancer (she used aluminum) two years ago, I had never told my folks any of my troubles, and thought I’d never worry them, as they are not in harmony with the truth. But one of the witnesses said, ‘‘Go to your father; he needs a housekeeper; he’ll love to have you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I have been with my father one and a half months now. I go to see the children each week. Once my husband came home before I had left and said that if I planned on coming back he’d treat me worse than before. Now he does my work and his too, and has much to worry him. He does not know what I might do, and the Devil has got him confused and uneasy, pale and thin. I, having no money, have no way of caring for the children. They believe as I do, and so are patient and hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God has shown me the straight path to follow and has helped me through every tight spot. Once, many years ago, my husband was particularly mean, and next morning he was unable to raise his head from the pillow, and three days he lay there unable to get up, not sick, nor paralyzed either. I do not have to wonder how it will all come out. I know that Jehovah will always win. It is not my battle, but the Lord’s, and the victory will be His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">My father and brother are very kind to me, and I am happy to get the meals and keep house here; and I can now get out in the service much oftener. These persecutions unite Jehovah’s people more closely, as we know we all suffer alike, and thus we learn meekness and patience and appreciate more our opportunities.</span></p>

Fine (?) idea. Not so long ago the technical magazines were boasting of an automobile body plant so perfectly mechanized that almost no employees were needed; everything was done automatically. President Halliburton’s idea would be that the thousands of men there displaced should be permitted to rest for the remainder of their lives. Various things could be done with them: they could be sent to Ethiopia or some other similar outlet; perhaps one of the new lethal gases could be used, and the proceeds could be worked up into fertilizer. All that would be necessary would be for President Halliburton and his friends to get their heads together and hire a high-priced efficiency expert, and buy up a few newspapers, and a method could be found of getting rid of the surplus that would meet with &quot;public” (i.e., newspaper) approval.</span></p>

Bierne; the officers of the company were present, uniformed state police officers, a local clergyman, a circuit court judge, and 100 members of the chamber of commerce. Then the employees were brought in, at nine o’clock in the morning, and induced to join the company union; the argument was that they must join or lose their jobs. Seems like a good argument, in these days, and the method is likely to succeed almost anywhere. A few additional suggestions are that jail sentences, heavy fines, hanging, etc., could be employed for recalcitrants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Water </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. William J. Hodge (Kentucky)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font11">ATER is abundantly supplied, as it covers three-fourths of the earth’s surface and is found flowing through the land in rivers, creeks, branches and rills and flowing out of the ground from springs where we like to camp on the warm summer days and drink cooling and refreshing nature’s beverage. It is the best of all drinks— water. Water is indispensable to man—an absolute necessity: we cannot get along without it. It floats our ships and develops the power to propel them, and makes the steam which pulls the heavy trains of commerce. We sit in ease and comfort as the steam carries us forward to our destination in the luxurious passenger trains of today. It supplies our factories, cities, homes, and, last but not least, it supplies the individual with that which makes his human mechanism function properly. It grows our foods in the field, garden and orchard; and how good they taste! Sometimes when we go into the grocery store and see the packages of food put up in such beautiful array of design of paper cover, it makes us hungry for* the cereals contained therein, but the great Creator and Source from whom come all good things has prepared in nature some packages which no man can imitate and which no artist can paint more beautifully. For instance, the watermelon, the cante-loupe, the apples, peaches, pears and other fruits, all wrapped in colors of the most beautiful design, and filled with the luscious food containing water; not only water, but water distilled in nature's great laboratory. During the process of growing and developing the fruit the water is carried from the earth upward and through the stem or plant into the fruit, and is thus distilled and is pure and healthful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An adult person of normal weight contains about eight or ten gallons of water. Our blood is about 90 percent fluid. So we see that it is essential that each individual be adequately supplied with pure water, in order that his body may have sufficient fluid to function in the normal way. When our fluid begins to run low, nature notifies us by the way of thirst, which must be satisfied or we suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Water can be used internally or externally. Therapeutically speaking, water has four effects upon the individual:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. It is a solvent. In fact, it is nature's greatest solvent. As the water passes through the ground it comes in contact with the minerals of the earth and these are dissolved appropriately by the water, and in this way we have natural mineral water.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">In the human body the water dissolves the accumulation around joints which makes us stiff and have rheumatism, and deposits in blood vessels which cause hardening of the arteries— arteriosclerosis. In these ways it helps to keep the body free from damaging accumulation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Water is a diluent. When we do not have sufficient water in the system our blood becomes thicker and more viscous and does not circulate so freely, and thus works a hardship on the heart and the blood vessels. In this condition poisons within the blood collect at points where the circulation is slower, and produce disease.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">So it is imperative that we have sufficient water to prevent these conditions from arising. Many people do not drink sufficient water. A few people drink too much.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">3. It is an eliminant. Everything taken into the body that is not required and appropriated as food must be eliminated or it soon becomes a poison. Wafer increases the function of elimination. It softens the bowel content and causes it to move along more freely by peristalsis through the intestine than it would if hard and dry, and thus promotes health. Water also has a favorable effect upon the kidneys, and also produces elimination through the skin by means of perspiration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Water is the great cleanser internally or externally. Not many people take baths too often. When water is applied externally it keeps the pores of the skin clean, nature functions much better, and as a result you are healthier and happier. It is a known fact that one whose body is clean, and well dressed, feels better, is happier and has a brighter outlook on life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Roman Catholic Action, and that it is opposed to every liberal and democratic government on earth. Governor Curley, of Massachusetts, is a typical Roman Fascist. In an address in Boston he fulsomely praised Coughlin and Mussolini in the same breath, and his crowd stood and lifted their arms ceilingward in the Fascist salute. The governor said, in part: “Mussolini has been for ten years the dominant force for peace in Europe and in the world. [Ethiopia, please take note.] This man, standing up alone with his blackshirts, stopped the Red tide from engulfing the world. Let no one forget that the one man more responsible than any other for the preservation of Christian [?] civilization is Mussolini.”</span></p>

Magistrate Brodsky, New York police court judge, holds the Nazi rule and its swastika in contempt, and should, and so do all decent people. The Swastika stands for infinite impudence and cruelty.</span></p>

In God's kingdom on earth there will be food and fuel for all, but it will not be passed out free. The rule ‘If a man will not work neither shall he eat’ is a good rule. Idleness is the mother of crime. It is better to build monkey houses than it is to do nothing. There is no virtue in mere quiescence. Life is action and work.

The board of education capitulated to the demand of the bankers, and the latter are now running the city of Chicago.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark186"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>The Transfiguration and Vindication</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font11"> PROPHET is one who foretells events that are to come to pass in the future. Jehovah is the only one who could predict what would come to pass or could give to others the power to do so, being guided by His spirit. The prophetic portions of the Bible are generally ignored by the professed religious leaders of “Christendom”, so called. They attach very little if any significance to the words of God’s prophets, and either deny altogether that the prophets w'ere such in fact, or discount the value and force of their prophetic utterances by claiming that they were merely carried away by their emotions, and that today there are those who have similar powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Quite differently does God’s Word speak of the importance of prophecy. “No prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the holy spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21, ff.R.P.) When Jehovah’s time comes to unfold the meaning of prophecy, He causes those who are devoted to Him to recognize its fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The thing that is of greatest importance in the execution of Jehovah's purpose is the vindication of His own name. The salvation of mankind is closely related thereto, however. The question raised by Satan’s rebellion must he settled, and God’s name cleared, before men can receive the blessing of everlasting life; for, “This is life eternal, that they might </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font11"> thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The relationship of vindication and salvation to each other is brought out in this scripture, as well as in other places. For instance, when the angels proclaimed the birth of Jesus and the purpose of His advent, they sang, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, to men of good-will.’ (Luke 2:14) Observe that vindication is mentioned first: glory to God in the highest; after which follows salvation: on earth peace among men of good will. Likewise, when Jesus stated the purpose of His coming He said, “The Son of man came . . . [first of all] to minister [in the vindication of Jehovah’s name], </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font11"> [secondly] to give his life a ransom for many.”—Matthew 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Scriptures point out the way which man must follow to have God’s approval.—Psalm 119:105;2 Timothy 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God does not reveal His secrets to the rebellious. “His secret is with the righteous.” (Proverbs 3:32; Psalm 25:14; 1 Peter 1:10-12; Ecclesiastes 3:1,17) Greater light is given to God’s people at the end of the world, where we now are. (1 Corinthians 10:11) It is then that prophecy is due to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Peter, writing under the inspiration of the holy spirit, makes special reference to the importance of prophecy, and its objective. He said, “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.”—2 Peter 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another translation gives the thought that prophecy was confirmed by the transfiguration on the mountain, to which Peter refers in the preceding verses. It appears that the transfiguration was a prophetic tableau giving testimony to Jesus as Jehovah’s vindicator and foretelling things to come. Peter says: “For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is mv beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” —2 Peter 1:16,17.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark188"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>The Transfiguration</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus and three of His disciples were in the mount when the transfiguration took place, Jesus’ face shining as the sun and His raiment becoming white as the light. The record says further: “Behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias [Elijah], talking with him.” (Matthew 17:3) Moses and Elijah were not actually there; for they were asleep in death, awaiting the resurrection. What the disciples saw was a vision, as Jesus himself said.—Matthew 17:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The appearance of Moses and Elijah in the prophetic tableau of transfiguration indicates that those men had done things foreshadowing greater things to be done by Jesus. Jesus, on another occasion said, “Moses . . . wrote of me.” (John 5:46) Elijah pictured the work of restoring the fundamental truths concerning the kingdom of God which had been lost sight of by Christians after the death of the apostles. With reference to this Jesus explained, “Elias truly shall first come [preceding the Lord’s coming to the temple], and restore all things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(Matthew 17:10,11) Jesus at the same time indicated that John the Baptist had done an “Elijah-work’’ in Israel, fulfilling on a small scale the prophetic prediction regarding the more extensive work of a similar kind which would be done, under the direction of the Lord Jesus, just preceding the time when the Kingdom should be ushered in. Reference to this great preparatory work, which included the restitution of fundamental Kingdom truths, is made in Malachi 3:1-3 and 4: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, the chief purpose of the vision of transfiguration was its designation of Jesus Christ as Jehovah’s great representative and vindicator. The voice out of the cloud was heard to say, ‘’This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The fact that Jesus warned the disciples that they must tell the vision to none until Jehovah had raised Him from the dead shows that the exaltation of Jesus to the position of honor would be after His resurrection.—Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 5:7-9.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark190"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>Importance of Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus was sent to earth to do His Father’s will, and He was wholly obedient. He declared that He was sent to bear witness to the truth, and His faithfulness in carrying out His commission was recognized in the title 'The Faithful and True Witness’.—Revelation 3:14; 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The disciples of Jesus, of whom the three witnesses on the mount were representative, must likewise be obedient to God and to God’s appointed King, Christ Jesus. God’s commands must be obeyed. “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice . . . rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.&quot;—1 Samuel 15: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In these latter days knowledge of God has increased and all who will may grow in knowledge and understanding. Christ Jesus having come to His temple, the fulfillment of the prophetic vision of transfiguration is taking place. The Lord at the temple is the Greater Moses, as foretold, •’For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.”—Acts 3: 22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?”—1 Peter 4:17,18.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark192"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>Confirmation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Peter, in his second epistle, urges the faithful to give diligence to adding to faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance patience, to patience godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love. He states that this is needful that they might “neither be idle </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">[margin]</span><span class="font11"> nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ”. He then introduces the transfiguration vision, showing that it pictured the power and coming of Christ. (Matthew 16:27-17:8) This coming in power and glory, the continuity indicates, was witnessed by the disciples when the Lord took them up in the mount to see the transfiguration. It was a prophetic tableau of His coming to His temple. The transfiguration scene was corroborative or in confirmation of what the prophets of old had written at God’s dictation. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font11"> rendering has it, “We have the word of prophecy made more sure.” The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott </span><span class="font11">reads, “We have the prophetic word more confirmed”; that is, we have additional proof or confirmation of what the prophets foretold. The thought is not that prophecy was of less value than the transfiguration scene, nor, as suggested by the common rendering, that the word of prophecy was “more sure” than what the disciples themselves witnessed. Rather, each confirms or supports the other. Similarly, Paul wrote, “. . . so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy [spirit], according to his own will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Peter does not refer to some particular prophecy, but had in mind all prophecy bearing on the coming of the Lord. Before Jesus’ first advent to give His life for man the prophets of God had spoken of His birth and His work and His death, but until He did come these prophecies were not understood. So also the prophecies relating to His second coming, for judgment and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">606 </span><span class="font11">vindication, were not understood until in course of being fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the coming of the day of Jehovah, the “dawn” of day mentioned by the apostle, all whose hearts would be in the right condition would recognize the “day star”. Christ Jesus is the “Morning Star”, and the knowledge of His presence is given to those who are watchful. (Revelation 22:16) “Star” means </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">prince,</span><span class="font11"> and Christ Jesus is the “Prince of Peace”, who comes in the glory of His Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All the prophets foretold the coming of Jesus and the setting up of His kingdom, but these prophecies could not be fully understood until in course of being fulfilled. Peter did not urge believers to become interpreters of prophecy, but his advice was that they should keep the prophecy before their minds in connection with the prophetic vision of transfiguration, As a light in a dark place, until the day dawn.’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>Not of Human Wisdom</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">The apostle knew that prophecy could not be interpreted without the Lord’s direction. He did not attempt to interpret it, and the words in 2 Peter 1: 20 were apparently intended for those who might be led away by self-appointed interpreters. Just as the prophecies relating to Jesus’ first coming could not be understood in advance, so those which apply to His second advent could not be understood until the Lord had “come to his temple”. That event was itself the keynote of prophecy, and the vision on the mount of transfiguration not only confirms prophecy, but points to its real purpose as being the manifestation of Jehovah’s vindicator at His temple when that event takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Until the actual coming of “day dawn” and the rising of the “day star” the Lord’s faithful people had some light, sufficient for their need; but there could be no general understanding of prophecy until God's due time had come. Many who have attempted the interpretation of prophecy before the time have failed, and have disappointed others who had too much confidence in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the very beginning of the Christian era men began to use the Word of God deceitfully, mixing it with worldly philosophy and twisting prophetic and other scriptures to serve their own selfish ends. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has for hundreds of years claimed the right to interpret the Word of God and has</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">made merchandise of that claimed authority. Other religious organizations have made similar attempts to limit the scope of the Lord’s Word to their own narrow viewpoint. Some have attempted to foretell the exact time of the Lord’s coming, and have drawn erroneous conclusions in regard to that event, some going so far as to prepare and wear white ascension robes and mounting roofs and other eminent places on a set day, thus making themselves ridiculous and casting reproach upon the Word of God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>Increased Light</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Paul indicated that there would be increased light shining from the Word of God at “the end of the world”, and other Scriptural statements corroborate this, including the words of Peter under consideration. Daniel stated that at the time of the end knowledge would be increased and his prophetic utterances would then be understood.—1 Corinthians 10:11; Daniel 12:4, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is as events in fulfillment of prophecy take place that these obscure utterances become luminous. Shedding some light all along the way as the watchful and faithful children of God followed the apostle’s admonition to “take heed”, the prophecies now blaze forth with the splendor of the rising sun, revealing the Son of Man with radiant countenance and raiment white as the light.—Matthew 17: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In due course “every eye shall see [discern] him”, but first those instructed of Jehovah and His great prophet Christ Jesus are made acquainted with this glorious truth. They have been awake and watching and have seen the “day dawn”. The day star has arisen in their hearts.—Isaiah 54:13; Revelation 1: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These faithful ones are commissioned to bear to others the testimony of the present Kingdom, setting forth the evidence, demonstrating the fulfillment of prophecy, and pointing to the imminent vindication of the name and purpose of Almighty God.—Matthew 24:14; Psalm 46:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“He cometh with clouds,” and as the cloud o’ershadowed the disciples in the mount, so now the cloud speaks of the presence of Jehovah. It was so in the wilderness journey, as God went forth before His people. Clouds represent trouble, but they also represent protection and comfort. To the people of good will the cloud will speak of guidance and care; to the enemies of</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the Lord it portends judgment and punishment. —Exodus 13: 21, 22; 14:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yes, soon every eye </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">shall</span><span class="font11"> see Him, though in the cloud, and they also that pierced Him by persecuting His remnant people on the earth; for He &quot;sliall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.’’—2 Thessalonians 1: 7-9, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As Peter, James, and John saw the Son of man coming in His kingdom (Matthew 16:28), so Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good will witness and testify to the realization of that which the transfiguration vision so beautifully foreshadowed and of which all the prophets in words sublime have spoken, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, in majesty and power as Jehovah’s great Vindicator.</span></p>

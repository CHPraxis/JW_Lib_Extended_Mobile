<h1><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>The</span><span class="font18"> Golden Age</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XVII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y., Wednesday, January 15, 1936 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 426</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Ideas on Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">TpiIE GOLDEN AGE</span><span class="font8"> has no health experts on </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J-</span><span class="font8"> its staff, and does not expect to have any. In the past it has published numerous health articles from various sources where the writers seemed to know what they were talking about. These articles have not always been consistent with one another; which is not to be wondered at, because no two health experts agree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Metabolism, the life process, the breaking down and using up of old cells and the manufacture of new cells, is dependent upon food, elimination, exercise, air, water, honesty and unselfishness. There may be other factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man is made up of sixteen elements, all found in wheat. When a dozen of these elements are refined out of the flour, the food made from the flour when stuffed into the system produces about the same effect as plaster of Paris would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God has given man a wonderful variety of fruits and vegetables which the common experience of man proves are necessary to health. Jesus ate roast lamb and broiled fish. The lamb was roasted, and certainly was not fried in an aluminum frying pan, nor was the fish thus cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The very first act of a healthy animal in the morning is that of elimination. Knowing this, it is the duty of man to train himself accordingly, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font8">though it becomes necessary at the beginning to rise a half hour earlier than he could wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every organ of the body must be exercised. Walking is splendid exercise. A suitable way to obtain it is by carrying the message of God’s kingdom in printed form from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If elimination is perfect, there is no danger from drafts. Such a person may occupy a corner room with all the windows in the room up from the bottom and down from the top and the wind whistling through the room all night without any danger whatever of his catching cold. Air </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is necessary to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Drinks suitable for mankind are cold water, often mentioned in the Scriptures for that purpose, and the fruit juices which naturally flow from the eating of fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An honest person is a happy person, and happiness is necessary to health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Love for God means accord with the great fountain of life, and could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If there are 1,200 kinds of diseases, it seems nonsense to say that mankind must have 1,200 kinds of poison scratched into his arm to keep him well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surgery is sometimes essential, but before submitting to the knife try the prescriptions above given, and remember that thousands, yes, millions, have been restored to health both by osteopathy and by chiropractic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Don’t bother to write in and call attention to the 25,000 remedies known to druggists. Some of them may be good for something, but most of them are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is about all </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> knows on the subject of health. It has no ambition to be known as a health magazine. There are some 30 schools of diet. It cannot claim and does not wish to claim allegiance to any of these schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is fully convinced that millions of people are killing themselves by eating white bread, too much pastry, fried potatoes, tea, coffee, spirituous liquors, late hours, laziness, hypocrisy, dishonesty, lack of air and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you know some better way to keep well, go to it. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> claims no monopoly of wisdom on the subject. If you know more and know how to steer your way around among the 25,000 “remedies”, 1,200 present and prospective serums, 30 schools of diet and the men with carving knives who are ready to cut out about forty percent of the stuff you came into the world with and still try to make you think you are as good as ever, you just go right ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is not putting the clamps down on health articles in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> but it is just trying to tell everybody that while it is not indifferent to the physical health of its readers, it has no ambition to be what is sometimes called a health magazine.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Breathe Deeply</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">E SHOULD all feel better if we breathed more deeply. Stop and take notice how shallow your breathing is, and then take a few deep breaths and see how different you feel. Of course, you cannot constantly think of your breathing, but to straighten up now and then and draw in several deep breaths will do you good.—Mrs. J. Howard.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Free Treatment to the Poor</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T&quot;\r.</span><span class="font8"> C. 0. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grimes,</span><span class="font8"> M.D., says that since reading the Watch Tower books and booklets and learning therefrom about the goodness of Jehovah God he has made it a rule to give free medical service to all who are too poor to afford a doctor. Many good men in the medical profession offer very low rates to the poor, and never collect a large part of their fees.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Excellent Cough Syrup</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">TpOR a very excellent cough syrup, make a strong tea of horehound leaves and the young stems. To the liquid add several drops of oil of eucalyptus and enough honey to sweeten. Take a teaspoonful when the coughing begins. It usually brings immediate relief.—Mrs. C. E. Huber, California.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Diabetes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">TAIETITIANS say that a tendency to diabetes may be corrected by the following pleasant preparation: Grate raw beets, and simmer until all juice is extracted. To this juice add the same quantity of orange juice and also an equal quantity of sweet cream. Take two tumblerfuls a day, adding the yolk of an egg to each tumblerful.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Kerosene for Stings</span></h3>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>&quot;Non-Habit-Forming Drugs”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">rpilE Buffalo (N.Y.) health department ad</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font8">vises against the use of so-called “nonhabit-forming drugs” in the form of sedatives and hypnotics used to induce sleep. In the one city of Buffalo there were nine deaths in ten weeks from the use of such drugs. Perhaps such drugs are called “non-habit-forming” because there isn’t much time to develop a fixed habit after you get to using them. Dead people do not form habits.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>1.421 U. S. Soldiers Died of Gas</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">N OFFICIAL report of the War Department estimates that 1,421 United States soldiers died of the effects of gas poisoning during the World War, 1,221 of whom were in hospitals when the end came. Besides these there are many thousands of others whose health and happiness were ruined by the same means. The report claims that mustard gas, first introduced by the Germans, is still the most effective gas known.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Ask to Be Put in Splints</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">F YOU are in a highway accident, and are one of the injured ones, you have a right to ask to be properly splinted before you are moved. Very many compound fractures are caused by well-intentioned persons who move the injured without knowing how to do it; so says the Roadside Red Cross, now setting up First-Aid stations at the points where the greatest numbers of motor accidents occur.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Olive Oil for Constipation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">F</span><span class="font8">OR constipation take olive oil and lemon juice before breakfast and before the evening meal. Start with a teaspoonful the first few days, and increase gradually to two tablespoonfuls. I squeeze the lemon into a tablespoon and fill with olive oil. This saves using a glass. The lemon cuts the bile, and the olive oil passes it on.—Mrs. J. Howard.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>The Green Demon of Ceylon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE green plague of Ceylon, the most deadly form of malaria known, and the most persistent, slew more than 113,000 persons in 1935. It is known that in the ignorance and panic many persons must have been buried while yet alive. In some instances little children buried both their parents.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>To Prevent Rabies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O KEEP </span><span class="font8">your dog from getting rabies you </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">can now </span><span class="font8">get a serum which will work if squirted in by a doctor. The dog is almost certain not to get the rabies, as he is most likely to die as a result of the pus injected. However, nothing can be guaranteed, for it happens that sometimes dogs get rabies from the anti-rabic serum. Of course, the dog would probably not get the rabies even if he didn’t have the serum injected, as rabies is extremely rare. Owners of kennels in Bound Brook, N. J., Oceanport, N. J., and Palisades, N. Y., who have handled thousands of dogs, testify that they never saw a dog with rabies. One of them says, “It has been my good fortune to have been intimately associated with dogs for the past thirty years, and I had never seen a case of rabies until serums were put in use within the last five years.” Nevertheless, the doctors are out to get laws passed which will make it compulsory for you to have your dog inoculated. There is nothing like making things of that kind “compulsory”. It brings in the dough.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>New Way to Become Blind</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">NEW way to become blind has been discovered. All one has to do if he wishes to lose his sight is to get some of the new drug dinitrophenol. Twelve women in the San Francisco Bay district used the drug to reduce their fat, and all w’ent blind. It is estimated that 100,000 American women are using the new drug. It really does remove the excess fat; literally burns it up.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Aids in Insanity Cures</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font8">HAS long been knowm that genuine love and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font8">kindness to the insane helps toward their recovery. Now it is learned that the opening of beauty shops in insane asylums is having wonderful effect upon the patients. They becoming interested in their personal appearance, it is not long until they become interested in other things, and the brain is greatly helped.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>For Skin Disease and Scalp Trouble</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AN </span><span class="font8">EXCELLENT application for skin and scalp diseases is made by dissolving four moth balls in two ounces of olive oil placed in a cup and heated in hot water or over a flame until the moth balls are melted. Rub on affected parts. So states Mrs. C. E. Huber, California.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE doctor told us my mother would never get up again, as she had inward cancer. My brother and I started to give her violet leaves, dock root and red clover tops. We made a pitcherful of the tea at a time, and she would drink of it, hut did not know’ what it wms for. We told her it was a tonic. From that time she began to improve, and she is up now and able to read. She also comes downstairs to her meals and sits on the porch when the weather is nice.—Mrs. J.

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">T IS claimed that chloramine (obtainable at drug stores), one 4.6-grain tablet for each ounce of water, makes a mouth wash which entirely removes the odor of garlic or onions. The cause of the odor is the aromatic substance in the essential oils which clings to the surface of the mouth, tongue and teeth after eating. Those who have tried this pronounce it very satisfactory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Simon Louis Katzoff,</span><span class="font8"> M.D., Ph.D., of Bridgeport, Conn., graduate in law, pharmacy and medicine, prominent physician and author, says he would no more put vaccine virus into a man than he would put a bullet into him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Is Taking Medicine Unscriptural?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">rpHERE is nothing in the scriptures of God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Word that forbids the taking of medicine that is known to be curative and not really injurious to the bodily health of Christians whose liyes and bodies are truly devoted to Jehovah God and His service. Note 1 Timothy 5:23: “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities”; this being written to faithful Timothy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isaiah 53 is quoted in Matthew 8:17: “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.” (A loose quotation from Isaiah 53:4) But it will be noted in all the accounts of the healings by Jesus that these were not performed upon His consecrated disciples, but upon those outside to give them a witness and manifestation of God’s power, to aid them to believe on Jesus. As a result many of the healed ones became thereafter the followers of Christ Jesus. Those who have believed on Christ Jesus because of His teaching and the Word of God need not such miracles of healing to be performed upon themselves to establish and maintain their faith in Him. Note the apostle Paul: God did not remove his infirmities, even though it is written by Paul himself: “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” (Hebrews 13:8) Hence Paul writes: “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities.”—2 Corinthians 12: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ’s miracles of healing were meant to foreshadow the great physical and mental and spiritual healing which He will accomplish for all of mankind who seek Him under His kingdom, when He reigns for a thousand years, to bless “all families of the earth”. Then He will take mankind’s infirmities and sicknesses, if they obey, and bear them away permanently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The power to accomplish cures in the name of the Lord was a “gift” from Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. This gift was not given to all followers of Christ Jesus in His earthly days and the days of the twelve apostles. Hence 1 Corinthians 12: 8, 9,10, 29, 30: “For to one is given, by the spirit, the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge, by the same spirit; to another faith, by the same spirit; to another the gifts of healing, by the same spirit; to another the working of miracles; . . . Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even as the “gifts of healing” were not given to all, so it was not the will of Jehovah God that the imparting of these “gifts of healing” should continue after the death of the apostles and their immediate or contemporary associates; but that such “gifts” should pass away, especially with the passing of the true church out of the stage of infancy and childhood to the maturity of manhood. (Ephesians 4:11-14) Hence, after speaking concerning the various “gifts” of the holy spirit, including healings, Paul writes: “Charity [love of God] never faileth: but whether there be [gifts of] prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be [gifts of] knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”—1 Corinthians 13: 8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul was favored with the “gifts of healing”; yet he writes: “But Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.” (2 Timothy 4: 20) Shall it be said that either Paul or Trophimus was disbelieving or unfaithful in not removing Trophimus’ sickness? Also concerning his companion, Epaphro-ditus, he writes: “Ye had heard that he had been sick. For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. I sent him therefore the more carefully.” (Philippians 2: 26-28) But Paul does not say he used the “gifts of healing” upon Epaph-roditus, nor did he prevent his getting “sick nigh unto death”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accordingly, a close examination of James 5:14-16 shows that it does not refer to bodily sickness and bodily healing, but to spiritual sickness and healing, such sickness spiritually being due to sins. And the oil used to anoint the sick one in the name of the Lord is not literal oil, but symbolizes the Word of God as a soothing comforter and healer and inducer of joy in the Lord, even as literal oil was used as a remedy in bodily healing. (Compare Hebrews 1:9.) The rest of chapter 5 of James bears out this </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">understanding. Hence the cures that so called </span><span class="font8">&quot;faith-healers” are reported to accomplish cannot be attributed to the holy spirit or power of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God, </span><span class="font8">but to the spirit and power from whom such “faith-healers” derive their religious teachings and which teachings such cures are performed to support and help to propagate, thereby to turn the people’s attention away from the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ and its work of vindicating Jehovah’s name and providing permanent cure of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N AN article which appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Culture,</span><span class="font8"> Dr. Simon Louis Katzoff tells the following tragic story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ She was one of the most beautiful children I have ever seen. I had known her for some time, although she was not a patient of mine. In fact, she wasn’t anybody’s patient. She was never ill. She was a splendidly healthy girl, glowing with vitality, bubbling over with childish enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Although she was but budding into young girlhood, you could visualize the sort of woman she was going to grow to be, strong, keen-minded, intelligent, a woman of quality, fit to mother a prince or a president. I used to call her the wonder girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then came the day when they bared her soft, well-rounded little arm and jabbed it with the virus point. She didn’t want it done. There was no need of it. And her parents fought against it. They knew that she had the health and strength that spells immunity to smallpox, but the authorities, the tools of the medical autocrats, insisted. So they injected into that blooming, perfect body the wicked vaccine virus, poisonous pus that comes from the sore of a diseased cow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And it did its deadly work. The poison sped through her system and the roses faded from her cheeks. She became a pallid, sickly thing, grew rapidly weaker—and died. The authorities said she died of pneumonia, but I knew better, and so did a number of physicians who saw and discussed the case. Her death was caused by the poison that was criminally injected into her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And as I looked upon the shrouded wax-like figure in the little basswood box surrounded by blossoms that would have matched her budding beauty, I felt as though I was looking upon the helpless victim of a murder, and I solemnly and silently vowed to work, as long as I lived, to wipe out the criminal practice of vaccination. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ENTLEMEN:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A notice was recently received by me from the office of the attendance officer, stating that I have failed to comply with the compulsory school law. I respectfully refute this statement with the following facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My child entered the Caesar Rodney school at Wyoming, Delaware, last fall, was in regular attendance there until transferred to the Brecht school, Lititz Pike, Pennsylvania; attended there regularly until another transfer was made to the city of Lancaster, when I presented her at the Administration Building, where I was informed that even though I could produce a certificate, the absence of any scar on my child’s arm would necessitate revaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At that time my child had a severe cold, the weather was at its worst and I decided that vaccination then would be more of a hazard than a safeguard to the child’s health. Furthermore, I did not know even the name of any doctor in Lancaster, and was depending upon taking my child to a doctor in Philadelphia who was held in high esteem by friends of mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I wrote for an appointment, and after quite some delay there came a reply stating that the doctor had died in 1932. Following upon this came the news of the serum scandal at Marietta, causing me to be more reluctant than ever about going to a doctor whose reputation I did not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just at this time I met a friend who was in position to know with absolute certainty that a doctor of his acquaintance was most particular in the handling of serums or vaccines, and ordered it fresh for each occasion. I promptly saw this doctor, and in the course of a month three different appointments were made which apparently the doctor found it impossible to keep. The last appointment was for Saturday, March 9, and I remained at home the entire afternoon, but was again disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During all of this time I was perfectly free to take my child into every other kind of public gathering—to movies, to church, to Sunday school. In fact, every Sunday in the city of Lancaster thousands of children of preschool age and unvaccinated are allowed to congregate in the churches and Sunday schools of the city, while the major portion of the congregation is made up of adults who have long since ceased to be protected by vaccine injected in early childhood, so it seemed to me indeed a shame that my child has had to miss so much school under circumstances I was doing my best to handle wisely, particularly because of two experiences of quite recent occurrence which I have found it impossible to dispel from my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first was that of a high-school girl who was vaccinated by my father-in-law, Dr. J. M. Houston, Elm Grove, West Virginia. In the weeks following her vaccination I personally answered frequent telephone calls each day from her parents who were almost frantic when the girl would suddenly lapse into unconsciousness so profound that nothing could arouse her, lasting anywhere from several minutes to several hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The second case was in Johnson county, Tennessee, where I met a mother and her very beautiful daughter of fifteen a few hours after they had received the shocking news that the daughter’s leg must be amputated because infection following upon vaccination had materially involved the bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having been an eyewitness to these most serious results of vaccination, no one could persuade me that the proceeding is altogether without danger, and if I had succeeded in having it done within the last few weeks, it would have been with the utmost reluctance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This combination of circumstances has caused me to look into the subject of vaccination very closely and I have, within the last few days, uncovered facts and figures which prove that any person who objects to vaccination has just as much, and more, to support his viewpoint than those who advocate it, in the form of information gathered during the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These facts and figures I am going to submit briefly, to show that my latest decision not to have my child vaccinated at all is not made through indifference to my child’s welfare, nor through ignorance of the subject of vaccination. To begin at the beginning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First act of vaccination performed by Edward Jenner, 1796. Twenty-two years later, in 1818, after vaccination had been practiced quite consistently, a severe epidemic of smallpox prevailed, and fresh doubts were thrown on the efficacy of vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1840 an act of Parliament was passed rendering a certain method of smallpox inoculation unlawful in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1898 the so-called &quot;conscience clause” was added, relieving parents of any penalty who satisfied a magistrate that they conscientiously </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">believed that </span><span class="font8">vaccination would be prejudicial </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">the health of the child. “Somewhat gloomy forebodings were expressed both in Parliament and elsewhere at the time of its incorporation in the act of 1898. On the contrary, its operation appeared to tend to the more harmonious working of the Vaccination Acts, by affording a legal method of relief to such parents and guardians as were prepared to affirm that they had a conscientious belief that the performance of the operation might, in any particular instance, be prejudicial to the health of the child.” (See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font8"> on Jenner, Vaccination and Smallpox.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Turning from England to the United States, I found in the health reports of the U. S. Army figures obtained under conditioris most favorable to their being accurate and fraught with the greatest significance. Here are the figures:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Deaths from Public Health Service reports, 10 weeks, September 20 to November 29, 1918: Whole United States (official estimate): Population 110,000,000, deaths, 350,000; rate per 100,000, 318; soldiers in camps (round numbers at signing of armistice), 1,500,000, deaths, 21,994; rate per 100,000, 1,466.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The death rate in the army exceeded that in civilian life to an extent one may well term staggering. With respect to these figures William Howard Hay, M.D., of Buffalo, New York, makes comment as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘Were not our boys in the army thoroughly ‘protected’? They were physically fit on admission to the army, else they could not have gotten by the examining boards; they were thoroughly, very thoroughly immunized against typhoid, meningitis, pneumonia, influenza, yet they died like flies, not on the firing lines, but right here at home in the concentration camps, where they were surrounded by the finest sanitary precautions that science could devise, and not only did they die, but they died of the very diseases against which they w<sup>T</sup>ere supposed to have been rendered immune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Do you doubt this statement? Look up the records of every cantonment in the country during the concentration of the army, and see for yourself whether or not this is true. The death rate in some camps reached four or five times the rate among civilians, these weak ones who were not able to go to war, -who did not have the blessings of immunization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“How much good did the serum treatment do these boys? Ask Louis Pasteur, if you can conjure up his disembodied spirit. We have no real proof of the boasted effectiveness of any form of antitoxin or vaccine serum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The true figures on vaccination for smallpox have never gotten before the public though they can be seen in the files of the various departments of the army as well as the government, if one cares to ask for them. If the record of vaccination in the Philippines alone were ever to become a matter of general knowledge it would finish vaccination in the whole country, at least among those who are able to read and think for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“After three years of the most rigid vaccination, when almost every little brown man had been vaccinated from one to six times, there occurred the severest epidemic of smallpox that the islands had ever seen, with a death rate running in places to almost 60 percent and in all well over 60,000 deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Did you ever know this before? Assuredly not. Yet it is found in the government records in just this form. Manila and the surrounding provinces were vaccinated most thoroughly; also they showed the highest case record and death record of the whole archipelago, while some of the outlying country was not so thoroughly vaccinated and escaped with proportionately less disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“How much good did we do these poor fellows? Ask Edward Jenner. He knows now, if so be that we know after death, and I am willing to believe that he would gladly spend a part of his eternity in ‘purgatory’ if he could undo the wrong he did the world by vaccination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More eloquent than ever this irrefutable testimony, in a country where “the majority rules”, is the fact that there are now only ten states in the Union where vaccination is compulsory, as against the overwhelming majority of thirtyeight states classified as follows: In six states, compulsion is optional with local authorities; in twenty-eight states there is no compulsory vaccination; while in four states compulsion has been declared unconstitutional and is prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The government bulletin entitled “The Notifiable Diseases” for the year 1932 will satisfy anyone that smallpox in these states is no more prevalent than in those where vaccination is compulsory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a climax to all this, there came to my notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">just yesterday information more important than all the rest, proving this to be more of a question of religious liberty than anything else, since the Bible over and over declares that “the life is in the blood” and that the taking of the blood of any animal into the human system even by drinking, is strictly forbidden; and that any person attempting by any other means to unite human blood strain with animal blood strain was to be stoned to death, and yet, calf-lymph (a component part of the blood stream of the animal) is introduced into the blood stream of human creatures by the process of vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one can possibly deny the truth of these statements nor deny that Infinite Wisdom has surrounded us with these restrictions, and on this ground I would now deem it a direct violation of my conscience to have my child vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This being the case, it is a violation of the Constitution of the United States any longer to exclude my child from the public schools, as no person is to be deprived of his rights and privileges as an American citizen by reason of his being obedient to the voice of his own conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By not having my child vaccinated, I invade the right of no one, and imperil no one. Failure of my child to be vaccinated—all being vaccinated who wish to be—since, if the vaccinated are not protected by their own vaccination, they would not be protected by the vaccination of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I stand ready and eager to comply with every clause contained in Section 1423 of the notice received from the attendance officer, as it requires only that I delegate the control of my child to others for the purpose of education and necessary school discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kindly preserve this document so that it may be brought to the attention of whomsoever it may concern, and all of these, I trust, will be 100-percent Americans, glad to take just action in support of liberty and the right of everyone to be “secure in his own person”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">-------, 1935 Mrs. F----E. H----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Mrs. H---:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days ago my father handed me a clipping from the Lancaster </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Era,</span><span class="font7"> containing a letter written by you, addressed to the Lancaster board of school directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I read this letter with a great deal of interest and am writing you with still more interest to learn whether or not you are still out of jail. I say this, not facetiously, but in all seriousness. For unless your family belongs to the proper social or political caste which the school board dare not touch, you will most surely be fined or imprisoned or both and pressure will be brought to bear upon you to the extent that you will either have your child vaccinated or will buy your way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have you not followed in the papers the case of John and William Marsh, two farmers from the mountains west of Carlisle? John and William were brothers, both farmers, both with large families, both poor, but making a living for their families. Nine years previous to the fall of 1933 William complied with the law and had two of his children vaccinated. They both went blind, one in both eyes, the other in one eye. The</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>the Foregoing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">eyeballs became pustular and sloughed out. So when in the fall of 1933 both brothers had other children ready to enter public school, they refused vaccination. They were promptly imprisoned. The prison term expired and they were imprisoned again after being released for a day or two. Finally the officials fixed it in such a way that the sentences simply repeated or renewed themselves, so that releasing and imprisoning was unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By this time a few of the more intelligent people were beginning to admire the courage of the fellows and to take an interest in the case. I wrote John Marsh a letter congratulating him on his courage and advising him to stick by his principles. As a result the two Misses Marsh brought the two blind girls into my office, which was at Camp Hill at the time, and told me the whole pitiful story. They were poor, they couldn’t afford to have a lawyer. They didn’t want any more blind children. Is there any liberty-loving citizen who could ask for less?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the aid of an uncle we called a mass meeting in the grange hall at Boiling Springs and told the people a few facts about vaccination. We asked for donations to hire a lawyer for these fellows. Over a hundred dollars was collected and turned over to the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I got busy and wrote to a number of the so-called “defense of liberty” organizations, among which were the American Medical Liberty Union, the Civil Liberties Union, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth-Teller. I</span><span class="font7"> wrote to several private attorneys who had a reputation for square shooting and defending the underdog, among which was Charles G. Margiotti, now attorney general of Pennsylvania, and Andrew G. Smith of Pittsburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">But I couldn’t find a one who would touch the case. Either they had to go buy a duck or they felt a defense was not justified or they advised a fake vaccination scar or they had some other excuse. They usually ended up by stating that there were only a few states in the Union with compulsory vaccination laws and the easiest thing would be to move out of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So I and other champions of the Marsh cause accomplished nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, like all things, it had an ending. William was released by the officials in Carlisle because he was the father of the blind children and public opinion was becoming so outspoken that a “necktie party” for some of the officeholders was feared. Upon the release of William, the public forgot all about John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the school officials didn’t forget about John or his family. They watched with vulture-like eyes the gradual culmination of events. The family of John Marsh, deprived of its income through the imprisonment of its head, was reduced to rags and poverty, dependent upon the neighbors for even food. Now was the critical time. The poor must be aided. The benevolence of official charity must be exerted. The children were committed to the county almshouse, and before such commitment the Act of Assembly was enforced ; the children were vaccinated forcibly, against the pleading desires of the mother, while the father lay in prison. The ends accomplished, the father was released from prison and another victory for compulsory medicine was recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And if John Marsh, embittered and filled with hate, becomes an outlaw and a bandit, what then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you were as poor as John Marsh the same thing would happen to your child. How are we going to stop it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only when a group of clear-thinking people such as yourself get together and form a closely knit organization with membership sufficiently large to impress a few politicians of its importance by a realization that it had a tremendous voting power. And then by smashing the compulsory vaccination law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Vaccinated Seventeen Tinies</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">CCORDING to the theory of the wise medics, vaccinated children are protected against smallpox. Unvaccinated children cannot harm the vaccinated ones. Just why an unvaccinated boy should be sent home from school is hard to understand, in view of the foregoing, unless we view it in the light of a sort of medical coercion, and that is just what the denial of public school rights to unvaccinated children is. Charles Zeigler was vaccinated when he was ready to start school. It made him violently ill, but did not “take”. So the doctors and school authorities have been vaccinating him and sending him home alternately until the boy has missed an entire term in the course of several years, and has had to submit to being vaccinated seventeen times. Now he is home again, and cannot return to school (where all the children are “protected”) until he produces some kind of certificate. But the family doctor will not vaccinate him again, and it would do no good if he did. Many intelligent men believe that compulsory vaccination is an outrage and an imposition which the medical trust will continue as long as the American people will stand for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Vaccination Compulsion</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE American Medical Liberty League, Inc., 35 East Van Buren St., Chicago Ill., notifies its many friends that, with the exception of New Mexico, there is not a state north of the Ohio or west of the Mississippi where vaccination is compulsory, and in five of those states, enlightened California, Arizona, Utah, North Dakota and Minnesota, compulsion is forbidden. Ohio and Oregon have vaccination optional with local authorities. In the remaining states of the Union vaccination is not compulsory in liberty-loving Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Those holding most firmly to the superstition are the Atlantic seaboard states that have great ports, six in number; also Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">One More Serum Overboard</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Simon Flexner,</span><span class="font8"> of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, states that it has been known for twenty-five years that the virus used to prevent infantile paralysis when applied to monkeys makes a certain percentage of them immune and paralyzes the rest of them, and that though numerous attempts have been made to preserve the immunizing properties and remove the paralyzing action the results have not been satisfactory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Soft Song” Men Become “Religious”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt;&lt;0OFT SONG” men, more generally known as “confidence men”, seem to have discovered where the easy money is to be had and are now flocking into the so-called “religious” business. The work is nothing, and the pickings are good. The Reverend Nicolas Toti, arrested by immigration authorities at Yonkers, laughingly admitted that he was an impostor, but had no difficulty shaking down Roman Catholic priests in New Britain, Waterbury, Bridgeport, Ansonia, Meriden, Danbury, New Haven, Hamden, Sharon, New London and Bristol, Conn., for $10 to $30 each. In Wisconsin he and another capable “soft song” man cleaned up $700 in one week from the same crowd. Of course, it is the people who pay, in the end. In a tour of six states he gathered in $1,557 in a few weeks. He laughed as he told about cabling the emperor of China for an audience, and coming away with $1,000 as easily as a boy can take a bite of an appl?. When not working the Roman Catholic priests he takes off his collar, dresses like a Protestant dominie, and works among the Protestant ministers, principally in the South. A capable “soft song” artist can learn all that any of these people know in a few minutes, and after that it is all a matter of theatricals. The man that can put on the best show gets the most money. The ability to snivel easily is one of the principal desiderata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hierarchy May Desert to Smith</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">T THIS writing the probabilities are that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has already deserted Roosevelt, finding that the policies advocated by the pope and adopted by Roosevelt have not worked out as expected. Their next choice would logically be Alfred E. Smith; and if America ever has another president, Smith is likely to be the man. William Randolph Hearst, whose mother was a Roman Catholic, and whose wife is reputed to be a Roman Catholic, has declared for Alfred E. Smith as his candidate. Smith, as everybody knows, is a Roman Catholic of the most pronounced type. That was the reason, and the only reason, he could not be elected before, but the American people, in their present perplexity, would probably be ready now to turn the country over to him, and to the pope, and get what the people of Germany got for doing the same thing. Coughlin’s alleged 8,500,000 or more voters would all go to Smith, without a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Smith Takes the Wafer Seriously</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE wafer, first manufactured in the eleventh century, is a small piece of unleavened bread bearing upon it the initials I.H.S. These wafers, sometimes given to the sick, are supposed to be the actual body of Christ, which, of course, they are not. If the sick vomit them, as sometimes happens, they are recovered and used again, as it would be out of order for the body of Christ to go down the drain pipe. Jehovah’s witnesses see in the bread and wine used in memorial of the Savior’s death, and of their share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, only symbols, but Roman Catholics are taught far otherwise. It is the Roman Catholic view that Alfred E. Smith represented, when, in speaking of Germany, he said in an address to Knights of Columbus: “In Germany—well a Jew ain’t a man, although his people sent the Redeemer into the world. A Catholic is not a man either, although in his veins flows the blood of the King of kings.” Smith acknowledges that the United States is a Christian nation and is puzzled that God does not strike dead the opponents of the Catholic church in Mexico.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Benefit of Clergy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> NUMBER </span><span class="font8">of subscribers have sent in various and sundry evidences of the zeal of the clergy. Picking out some of the tokens, the following come to hand:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Father” Jerome, O.S.M., of Chicago, Ill., says, “The intercession of our Blessed Mother and St. Jude are most powerful in Heaven. In recognition of your charity to us in our need, they will help you in your needs. ... As a token of my remembrance and appreciation, I send you a Blessed Medal of good St. Jude.” Now, why doesn’t “Father” Jerome go to Jude direct and eliminate all this letter-writing and begging and medal-blessing<sup>1</sup>? The medal, by the way, looks as if it was made of aluminum. Best not to wear it next to the skin, if you have been favored with one and are thinking of wearing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Cadle Tabernacle of Indianapolis, which calls itself the world’s largest soul-saving enterprise, says that for $10 “you can endow one of the chairs in the auditorium, in honor of one of your loved ones. Their name will be on a plate, fastened neatly to the back of the chair. . . . You may take six months to pay”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">St. Aemilian’s Orphan Asylum has a neat scheme of getting ten thin dimes. They send you a folder into which you may insert these ten coins, one for each of the five sacred wounds and one for each of the five sorrowful mysteries. The spaces in which you insert the dimes are marked, “Agony in Garden, Scourging at Pillar, Crowning with Thorns, Carrying of Cross, Crucifixion, Left Hand, Right Hand, Left Foot, Right Foot, Sacred Side.” This is all in the business. It is suggested that the “sacrifice of an ice cream, candy bar, cigar, cigarettes, liquor, movie, show or dance will gladden the heart of the Suffering Christ and his poorest of poor—The Orphans”. How anyone who has any love for Christ can thus commercialize the memory of His suffering is indeed a sorrowful mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now “Christ’s Beggar”, the “Very Rev.” Msgr. Jos. F. Kroha, connected with the foregoing St. Aemilian’s Orphan Asylum, implores as follows: “In a spirit of sacrifice and as an atonement and expiation for your sins you are urged during Lent to forego some of the luxuries of modern life, as candy, gum, tobacco, cosmetics, intoxicating drinks, sodas, ice cream, movies, theaters, dances, public parties, elabo</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rate dinners, etc. </span><span class="font8">But keeping the savings only defeats the purpose of sacrifice and turns an intended virtue into another vice—avarice and selfishness.”—A swell idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next, the abbot general of the Cistercian Order sends out the Abbatial Blessing and says, “Large sums of money are needed, and therefore I appeal to you for help.” A circular enclosed with the letter says, “Since the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass can give more help than anything we could do by prayer and good works, it is only natural that we desire ardently to secure daily and for all time the special fruits of the Mass. This privilege is offered you if you will join the Cistercian Perpetual Mass League. By sending ten dollars, either in a lump sum or in parts, or a hundred dollars for an entire family . . . you will be enrolled as a perpetual member.” Only ten or a hundred dollars, gentle reader!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The appeal of the Eighteenth Street Methodist Episcopal church is pathetic. Its modest budget of $3,500 must be met. More than half of this goes for the pastor’s salary and taxes on the parsonage, which, for some reason, is not tax-exempt. The organist must have $260, the sexton $600, following the example of the pastor. The 18th St. M. E. might get some pointers from the Catholic laborers mentioned in this column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is an idea for Protestant “pastors” who cannot send out medals, rosaries, relics, scapulars or other trinkets, nor offer masses at so much for “membership” in the mass league. The Penny-a-Meal Bank is quite a catchy idea, a wonderful plan, in fact. Place one in every home. Results are astonishing. So says the Banthrico Co., which assures the pastor or sheepshearer further, “It requires only a contribution of one penny at each meal by members and friends of your church. The Penny-a-Meal Bank is loaned to each of them for the accumulation of their pennies. Each Bank in use will bring in from $100.00 to $300.00.” The Bank has a coin slot that prevents coins from being shaken out, and a strong lock on bottom end that opens only with a key. You have guessed it, Clementine, the “church” keeps the key.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now here is a rather unique plan. Have the suckers (excuse it,—the “faithful”) send in $2 OR MORE [this is in caps] for a Vigil Light. It must be a “blessed” vigil light, of course. As an inducement offer a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">beautiful</span><span class="font8"> rosary, made with metal in which has been mixed the metal from coins which were (perhaps) in circulation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">in our Lord’s day and which (very perhaps) the Lord himself handled. Just think of it. Of course, the amount of this metal in each rosary is infinitesimal ; but what of it, if it brings in—that is, if it may be touched by your very own hands? On the other hand, it may be that thirty of these coins, the metal of which was mixed in the rosary chain, were handled by one who professed to be the friend of Jesus and greeted Him with a kiss in the garden. One can never tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Or, appeal to the imagination; that always works, or has always worked. Take these nice little envelopes, for instance, each with a number on it (they have your number), and each bearing a “holy” picture. One is to contain offering for the Catholic University, another an offering for the “Holy Land”. Then there is a pretty picture of St. Peter’s Cathedral, the building of which precipitated the “Reformation”, referred to by the Hierarchy as “the great sedition”. This envelope is to contain the offering for the “Holy Father”. Next comes the “All Saints” envelope, with the reminder that this is a Qioly day of obligation’. It has on it a picture of a priest holding aloft a glass of wine, which he is about to drain. The idea is that the more the priest drinks, the more of the “holy souls” escape from “purgatory”. Then there are various and sundry other envelopes, and each has a space for name and address and the suggestive line marked with the inspiring $acred $ign of $atan’s $anctuary. There is one envelope marked “Initial Offering Envelope”, upon which appears the legend, “Each member is requested at the first service attended to contribute 15 cents in this envelope to defray the cost of the envelope system.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, best of all is the plan of Holy Rosary Cathedral of Regina, Sask., which sends out a letter with the following inducement to ‘love</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and good works’: “In the hope that you will continue this same charity towards us this year, I am enclosing 2 books of tickets. One is on the Holy Rosary Cathedral and the other on the Blessed Sacrament Church, which on account of financial difficulties His Grace has been obliged to take over. You will notice that the first prize is $1,000.00 ; 2nd $250.00; 3rd $100.00; and that the person selling the ticket which wins the $1,000.00 receives $200.00. Besides these, fortyseven cash prizes, ranging from $25.00 to $5.00 are offered—all for 25c. The draw takes place -------. I feel, dear friend, that in a district where a little money is in circulation it will be very easy for you to sell these tickets. I do hope you may win the $1,000.00, or one of the other large prizes. . . . How shall I conclude this letter if not by again begging you in youi’ charity to be mindful of our misery. We could hardly be more destitute here. ... I place our cause in your hands. I depend upon your help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though in dire misery “His Grace” is still able to offer prizes totaling $2,025, which is something. Anyway, he was willing to stake it on the chance of bringing in many times that amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An item which has been overlooked is that “Father” Jerome, first mentioned, will be glad to pray for your intentions, especially if you send $2 </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">or more</span><span class="font8"> for a Vigil Light. You can choose any of the following benefits; Happy Marriage or Happy Death, Success in Business, Employment, Family Happiness, Peace of Mind. “We extend this privilege to you,” says “Father” Jerome, “for whatever offering you can afford.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And thus, dear reader, endeth this account of the zeal of the clergy. The object of this effort has been to present things honestly and without misrepresentation. Hence the frequent quotations. No doubt you have been duly edified.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>She Died a Catholic</span></h2>

<p><span class="font8">took sick and had to be taken to a Catholic hospital, where she died. She died a Catholic! By what means an individual who has never been a Catholic in life becomes a Catholic in death is a matter of great perplexity. In one’s last illness the mind is not always clear, and it is possible for a sick person who has been wearied with entreaties, cajolements or what not to finally “give in” because strength to resist gives out. When Catholics speak of converts to their “faith”, it includes numerous such cases. This is one reason for the existence of Catholic hospitals. It is difficult to credit with sincerity those who resort to such questionable and unscrip-tural means to gain converts to their “faith”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that in this case the “regenerating baptism” was administered after the patient breathed her last, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">Catholics hold that a priest can grant absolution even after apparent death on the chance that life still remains in the body. Whatever may be the tortuous reasoning process by which the zealots seek to justify such obnoxious methods to increase “the glory of holy church”, it is certain that their course of action is contrary to all sound reasoning and thoroughly unscriptural. It is the result of laying more stress upon the word and “authority” of fallible men than on the Word and authority of Almighty God. The doctrines of the Roman Hierarchy are by no means as clear and explicit as some suppose, but the questioning individual is silenced by the rebuke that he is doubting “holy church” and that he must exercise faith in God’s supposed agency. The assumption is that “faith” is coh-trary to “reason”, and that to be an acceptable believer one must believe everything taught him, without investigation or consideration. Such is not the faith which the true believer exercises or which God requires. True faith has a reasonable foundation; and knowledge and understanding, so highly recommended in Scripture, are an essential and integral part of that faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many sincere Catholics, no doubt. That they are hungering for something more satisfying than the husks of tradition and ceremony is certain. Let them turn to the Word of God and honestly and prayerfully seek for “knowledge and understanding”, making use of such helps as will really answer their questions, and they will find the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the news of the discovery of a new land beyond the ocean reached the peoples of Europe, it reacted differently on different classes of people. To those who were adventurously inclined, it opened up newer opportunities for adventure or spoil. And to those who were regarded as dissenters from the established church, and oppressed, it offered an asylum and a haven, where they hoped to worship their God freely, according to the dictates of their own conscience. And so, when spurred on and encouraged by this hope, one family after another reached the shores of the new land, now known as America, they formed their own exclusive settlements and communities, guided by the differences of their religious beliefs and practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the colonies had declared and won their independence by a successful revolution, they adopted a constitution embodying the fundamental laws for the governing of the new-born free nation of the United States of America. Later it was seen fit to add amendments to the already adopted Constitution. The result was the ten original amendments, declared in force in 1791, and constituting a supplementary bill of rights, taken from the suggestions of the States. The first part of the first Article of Amendments declared: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">True “patriotism” is defined as “devotion to the welfare of one’s country”, and I fail to see any amount of patriotism in the acts of men whose energies are directed against small, harmless children and their widowed mothers, who have done no harm to anyone, intend to harm no one, but want to live in peace with their God and their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “patriotism” of George Washington and Patrick Henry and other truly great Americans was not directed to injure and ostracize wellmeaning small children who had refused to salute an emblem. I can’t think of heroic Washington, of liberty-loving Patrick Henry, of fatherly Benjamin Franklin and of benevolent and magnanimous Abraham Lincoln doing the things which are being done today under the name of patriotism. No! I have too much respect for them to expect of them such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we want to be truly patriots like those great men, let us do the things that will help to the welfare of the people and the country, by lending a helping hand to those who are in distress, by carrying a message of comfort to those who are in need.—A.

<p><span class="font7">For nineteen centuries the people of good will have looked with expectancy to the coming day when there would be a separation of the nations of the earth into two specific divisions. They have based their expectations upon the prophecies recorded in the Bible, which they fully believe. The fact that the Lord has declared that there shall be a separation of the nations is conclusive proof that the separation must take place in due time. That due time is now here, and already the work of separating the nations is progressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should separation take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What irresistible power is doing the separating work ? What influences have to do with such separation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the proof that the separating work has begun ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it possible to now foresee the final result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does the separation involve religion, commerce, politics, and the people in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What must the people of good will do in order to be on the safe side?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible and the well known physical facts make the answer to these questions simple, clear and easily understood. The man who by reason of his learning in the Bible and acquaintance with world conditions is therefore fully qualified to make known the correct answer to these questions, and related questions, is Judge Rutherford. His books published in more than sixty languages and distributed amongst the people in excess of 200,000,000 volumes is proof of this assertion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Sunday February 23, 1936, at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, California, Judge Rutherford will deliver a lecture to the public on the subject, &quot;Separating the Nations,’’ and will fully answer the foregoing questions. The lecture will begin promptly at twelve o’clock noon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same time, that lecture will be broadcast by radio throughout America and will be transmitted by radio, wire, and other electrical means to the ends of the earth. It is of vital importance to hear it, because the lecture will disclose facts and indisputable proof showing the separation of the nations has begun, and will enable every intelligent person to choose the side he will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whether you agree or not, you cannot afford to miss hearing Judge Rutherford. Ascertain in advance what radio station in your vicinity will broadcast the lecture and over which you can hear it best. Set the dial of your radio on your station and wait for twelve o’clock noon, Pacific time, and then carefully listen. Tell your neighbors about it and invite them to listen with you.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE BIBLE is not the product of man. It is the authoritative Word of God given by Him to men for their instruction in righteousness. There is no other true and perfect guide. Men wholly devoted to God wrote the Bible at the dictation of Jehovah. Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible. There are two lines of testimony proving that the information contained therein is from the Lord and therefore true. First, the historical facts could easily have been handed down by tradition from father to son from the day of Adam until the day of Moses. Second, man being the most intelligent earthly creature, it is to be expected that his Creator would give him a correct guide, and in harmony therewith God inspired holy men to write the Bible. At 2 Peter 1:21 it is written: ‘Holy men of old wrote as they were moved upon by the spirit of God? The indisputable argument supports these two points, the proof in detail thereof being set forth in the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, </span><span class="font8">which you should read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus Christ is the Son of Jehovah God and was sent to earth to give the truth to those who desire to learn. The words of Jesus prove that the Bible is God’s Word and that it is true. He said: “Thy word is truth.” Jesus often referred to and quoted from the prophets who lived prior to His day on earth, and this He did with the approval of Jehovah, for the reason, as He stated, that He, Jesus, ‘spoke the words of God as the Father gave them to Him.’ (John 3:34) Jesus said that Moses wrote of Him, and He often quoted from Moses. (John 5:46) Jesus urged the people to study the Scriptures because they disclose God’s purpose toward man. He who believes on God and Christ Jesus must believe that the Bible is the truth. Knowing the Bible to be true, then you may be certain that it is the safe guide for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why has God given the Bible to mankind? The answer is found in 2 Timothy 3:16 in these words: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” That it is a guide for man one of the holy prophets under inspiration wrote, at Psalm 119, concerning the Bible: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Only by learning and following the instructions given in the Bible is it passible for man to go in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil is man’s worst enemy, and at all times he has endeavored to turn men away from God; and in doing this he has caused some men to repudiate the Bible, while others grossly misrepresent and misapply it. He has used men who claim to teach the Bible to keep the people in ignorance of what the Bible really contains. Many have been the attempts by the Devil and his agents to destroy the Bible and to destroy all books written which enable the people to understand the Bible. Those efforts by wicked men cannot succeed, for the reason that it is the will of God that man shall have the opportunity to learn the truth. If he diligently seeks to know the truth, he will find it. God does not force the ■truth upon anyone. If a person would understand the truth, he must diligently apply himself to gaining knowledge thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophecies of the Bible were written centuries ago, and are now being fulfilled. No human mind could have thought out, composed and written these prophecies; and this of itself is proof that the prophecies proceed from God and are written down by men as God directs. That the prophecies are now being fulfilled shows that now is the due time for man to understand the Bible. To aid the people to gain a knowledge of the Bible men and women who love and serve God have joined together in a work of bringing these Bible truths and helps to the attention of the people because this is the will of God that it shall be done. The Bible alone makes known how man may gain life everlasting in peace and happiness. To gain a knowledge of the Bible is therefore a great favor from Jehovah. You owe it to yourself and to your children to obtain that knowledge of the truth. The Bible does not support any religious organization. It discloses the purpose of Jehovah God toward the human race to guide the man to God through Christ Jesus, the world’s Savior.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>“Nearly if Not Entirely Secret”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font8">ROBABLY some priest or preacher wrote an editorial for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Oklahoman</span><span class="font8"> under the headline “Misnaming Themselves<sup>-</sup>’ and intended to reflect on the courage and honesty of Jehovah’s witnesses. The editorial in question contained the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No real importance attaches to the name of the “witnesses”. But there is something significant if not measurably sinister in the fact that the order is nearly if not entirely secret. It is at least disconcerting to discover the existence of an order which chooses to work under cover for what the Quakers work for openly. Why this secrecy, when liberty of conscience is recognized and guaranteed by the federal constitution ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This was too much for one of his subscribers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">0. </span><span class="font8">P. Cottman, who wrote the editor the following letter, which letter will be enjoyed by all:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Herein you will find a. clipping from your editorial page </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Oklahoman,</span><span class="font7"> dated Nov. 14th, 1935, headed “Misnaming Themselves”. The subject matter therein contained is about and concerning “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Being interested in the work that these people are now doing and have been doing for the past eighteen years, and having some knowledge of the volume and magnitude of the work already accomplished, I am surprised, to say the least, to find such “Misinformation” given publicity in your editorial column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did a fellow by the name of Rip Van Winkle write this editorial? Or was it written by someone who has been asleep for the past twenty years? Whoever it was that wrote this is either not keeping up on the happenings or he deliberately tried to hide the truth. He does not seem to know that Christ Jesus is the ‘Faithful and True Witness’ of the true God, Jehovah. See Revelation 1: 5. He does not seem to know that true Christians must be footstep followers of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. See 1 Peter 2:21. Therefore a true Christian must be a witness for the true God, Jehovah, which means to bear testimony for the true God, Jehovah. In this connection, concerning the duties and name that Jehovah God has given to His people on earth, read Isaiah 43:10,11,12, and Isaiah 44: 6, 7, 8. You might read the next three verses of chapter 44, which says something about “graven images” and “other gods”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One might fail to study the Scriptures and not be informed of the above provision in the Bible concerning the name and duty of Jehovah God’s people, but please tell me how anyone could live in the thriving city of Oklahoma, in which the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oklahoman</span><span class="font7"> is published, and not know anything about Pastor Russell, now deceased, Judge J. F. Rutherford, president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brooklyn, New York, or the work that is being openly done by said Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, to the praise and honor of Jehovah and His Son Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you say that you do not know anything about </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you say that you do not know anything about the radio programs sponsored by Jehovah’s witnesses featuring Bible lectures spoken by Judge Rutherford ? These have been broadcast for about five years by more than two hundred radio stations in the U.S.A., said lectures being electrically transcribed. Your own station WKY has had some part in this work by radio, and will you say that it was done secretly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you say that you do not know that Judge J. F. Rutherford is one of “Jehovah’s witnesses”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you state that the great chain broadcasts sponsored by Jehovah’s witnesses and featuring Judge Rutherford’s Bible lectures, many of which used more than 150 radio stations, was in secret? Was this done in a corner? Your fine radio station WKY joined in some of these chain broadcasts. Have you forgotten about the wide coverage that your station enjoys, •when you say “nearly if not entirely secret”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you state that you do not know anything about the Petition to the United States Congress signed by more than 2,400,000 citizens of this nation, in which Congress was asked to safeguard the radio for freedom of speech? This petition was circulated by Jehovah’s witnesses; will you state that this was a secret matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of this giant petition the Congress of the U.S.A, caused a hearing to be held by the Federal Communications Commission, Broadcast Division. Will you state that this hearing was also to keep something secret? You know that this is a matter of public record and what Jehovah’s witnesses have been trying to do and are doing, by the grace of Jehovah, is to get the Truth before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will you state that you never saw or heard of the millions upon millions of radio announcements that have been distributed to the people, inviting them to tune in one of the radio broadcasts sponsored by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font7">hovah’s witnesses and featuring Judge Rutherford in Bible lectures? May I ask, Was this done in secret?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can you remember as far back as June 2, 1935, when your station WKY joined in with many other radio stations in America and throughout the world, in the greatest broadcast that the world has ever known? The occasion was a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled at the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. Judge Rutherford delivered the speech “Government” before a visible audience of over twenty thousand people on this date, and the message was carried to the world by the greatest hookup of wires and telephone, radio and sound amplification that the world has ever known. May I ask, Is that news? Did you help to advertise this bit of news? Did you try to keep this news out of reach of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We might call your attention to many other things that have not been done “in secret”; but that is not the question that I want answered. Will you give the people the facts and the news? That is what many people are now asking. I shall thank you to let me know what you are going to do about correcting the “Misinformation” in your article under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yours truly,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ONCERNING the editorial “Misnaming Themselves”, in the November 14 issue of your paper, please note the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your editorial is a gross misrepresentation of the truth which you should, and doubtlessly do, know.—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The name “Jehovah’s witnesses” is not a misnomer, and they who bare that name did not choose it themselves. It is a name given by Jehovah to those who are fully devoted to Him. They “bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ”.—Isaiah 43:10, 12; Revelation 1: 2, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As everyone knows who has listened to Judge Rutherford’s lectures and has read his publications, it is not a secret order in any sense of the word. All such know that your statement is false, and I believe that you know it as w’ell as many others who read the article. (John 8: 44) In fact your article supports certain Scriptural truths called to our attention by Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* • *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “Man of Galilee”, who forbids His followers to use carnal weapons, is in perfect accord with Jehovah, His Father, who commanded the Israelites to slay the Canaanites. Jehovah is the Giver of all life and He reserves the right to take life. He alone has that right, and all else is murder whether legalized by man or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Israelites were God’s chosen people, and the Canaanites were His enemies. The slaying of the Canaanites was typical and foreshadowed the slaying of Jehovah’s enemies at the end of the world, where we now are, but first He wills that all the world be notified of this one of His purposes. This slaying of His enemies will be done by His executioner and avenger, the “Man of Galilee”, Christ Jesus, the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, are process servers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So you see it cannot be a secret order, as the distribution of the more than 200,000,000 of books and booklets in 60-odd languages in the past 13 years will testify. The Devil would have people to believe it to be a secret order, and you have been easily duped by that great deceiver. I consider myself one of Jehovah’s witnesses and deem it the very highest honor that can be bestowed on any of His creatures, the result of His creation. Where do you stand? Do you wish to continue your assault against Him ? If so, you may expect complete destruction in the near future.—Dr. John L. Wooding, to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Oklahoman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Land of the Free</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE following is taken from a story in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-Tribune:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Oct. 31, it was discovered that Vivian Hering, 6 years old, of Secaucus, N. J., was muttering something under her breath while her classmates saluted the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On investigation it was found that Vivian had been reciting, not the pledge of allegiance, but the fifth verse of the 20th Psalm—“We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">She was expelled with her sister, Alma, 11, who refused to say anything. When their case came up for hearing, a New Jersey lawyer and an educator who appeared in the Hering girls ’ defense were threatened with lynching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Assemblyman Alex Adams is one of many laws passed without due consideration of the letter and spirit of the constitution. Religious liberty was a matter that strongly enlisted James Madison’s feelings. When it was proposed that under the new constitution “all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of the conscience”, Madison pointed out that this provision did not go to the root of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, is something which every man may demand as a right, not something for which he must ask as a privilege. To grant to the state the power to tolerate is implicitly to grant to it the power of prohibiting, whereas Madison would deny to it any jurisdiction whatever in the matter of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clause in the bill of rights, as finally adopted at his suggestion, accordingly declares that “all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Rev. William C. Kidd, principal of Lakewood high school, brands Russell Sperling, 16, Lakewood student refusing to salute the flag, a “publicity stunt for Jehovah’s witnesses”. Such a statement reveals religious bigotry and intolerance. The truth of the whole matter is, Russell Sperling is a dissenter or nonconformist to arbitrary law and is defending his constitutional right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an editorial “Dr. Crane and Oaths” you truly say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“As for the teachers’ oath, there is, of course, no harm in it on the surface, but beneath the campaign that forced it upon the statute books is an obvious effort to confine thought in the schools to definitely prescribed limits. Otherwise there would be no need for the oath. No one believes that the recitation of a compulsory oath could influence those who would [take it]. The real significance of the oath is that it is designed to frighten teachers against deviating from old formulas and introducing an occasional new idea in their classes. The law requiring it is not only an insult to teachers, but it is an objectionable step toward Fascism in that its underlying purpose is to open to pupils only lines of thought which those who inspired the compulsory oath think they should follow. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nowhere under God’s canopy of heaven did civil and religious liberty exist until Washington established it in the British colonies in America. This is the message our flag brings to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To salute the flag is not in the true sense an act of patriotism. Major Andre saluted the three militiamen near Tarrytown, but his dissimulation was quickly apprehended. So you see the mere saluting the flag is no evidence of patriotism; it may be only a form of patriotism and the power or real essence of true loyalty to country lacking. Patriotism is obedience to what the flag stands for, namely, love—the love of family, the love of home, the love of the nation. That is what it represents, and under that flag there should be the most perfect state of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The man or woman who practices what the flag stands for is one of the best of neighbors and one of the safest of friends and one of the greatest of patriots.—Samuel Bright, in the Asbury Park (N.J.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News.</span></p>

[New York magistrate Brodsky’s definition]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident the parents of the children that refuse to salute the flag are conscious of the difference between degenerate democracy that shouts for the flag, and the Power behind the breeze that floats it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The children’s attitude toward flag salute can conscientiously be supported by all true wideawake Americans. And if there is any liberty, school boards will do well to let it remain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N TEXAS this week two young Negro boys accused of murdering a white girl were taken from the sheriff by a mob and lynched. Nothing has happened. County Attorney 0. P. Moore said, according to The Associated Press, “I do not call the citizens who executed the Negroes a mob. I consider their action an expression of the will of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And County Judge A. P. Hahn added that he could not condemn the members of the mob because the youth of the Negroes would have prevented them from being “adequately punished”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One assumes that both the county attorney and the county judge, on being inducted into office, took an oath to uphold the Constitution, which, according to report, guarantees all defendants the right of fair trial. Nothing in the Constitution or in all of its amendments gives a mob the power to seize, murder and mutilate criminal suspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Proving again the idiocy of “taking oath”. As illustrated by the hocus-pocus of making school children swear fealty to the flag and to the Constitution of which the flag is a symbol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The irony is this: a number of immature children, members of a religious cult, Jehovah’s witnesses, have been expelled from school for refusing to abide by the silly ceremony of saluting the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the mature Texas prosecutor and judge, already sworn, flagrantly violate their oath and wink at lynch law and mob murder. And they keep their jobs, with amens from “nigger haters”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will the same people, organizations and papers that condemned the “unpatriotic” school children and demanded their expulsion now step forward, please, and demand the ouster of the Texas officials?</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font8">HADES of William Penn! The memory of the historically minded Pennsylvanian tells </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">him that </span><span class="font8">one of the fundamental articles of the original charter was religious toleration. We were to be even freer than the Colonists of Maryland, for under the Calverts it was necessary or compulsory to believe in the Trinity under any church discipline—but in Pennsylvania a man was free to worship as he chose and follow the dictates of his own conscience. Naturally, test oaths were abhorrent to the Quakers, since their simple belief rested on the literal interpretation of Scripture. If there is now a law in Pennsylvania which makes it obligatory to salute the flag or make a pledge, which in the eyes of many religious sects amounts to taking an oath, it is time for intelligent Pennsylvanians to look into the matter, and instead of resorting to the Inquisition measures of flogging, haling into court, expulsion, etc., either make allowance for conscientious objectors or abolish such a childish statute by due course of parliamentary procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chauvinists are not our thoughtful constructive citizens, and much flag waving and its natural concomitants inevitably lead to conflict of some sort. Intelligent and understanding persuasion will do far more to educate children in fundamental Americanism, and never lead to Bolshevism, if that is the fear of the school authorities. The writer has always understood the modern Communist was an atheist, while utterances of the sect called “Jehovah’s witnesses” sound like primitive Christianity.</span></p>

I was at a woman’s club the other day where we were all expected to extend our arms stiffly and mutter over the set words of the flag salute.

<p><span class="font8">While there is nothing wrong with saluting the flag—with reservations—there is something damnably wrong about compelling children to do so. It is a vicious form of idolatry. “If you get people to worship a flag, they stop thinking and you can do anything with them, like making a king holy, kneeling to him, taking off your hat to his robe—then dying for him.” It prepares the next generation for cannon fodder to make the world safe for Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flag helped make Mexico safe for the American oil interests in 1914; Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues. It brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916; it helped make Honduras right for American fruit companies in 1903; in China, in 1927, it helped see to it that Standard Oil went its W’ay unmolested—to mention just a few.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aul,</span><span class="font8"> the apostle of the gentiles, was a Roman citizen. He obeyed the laws. He preached obedience to the laws. Yet he went to his death for refusing to bow to the imperial eagles. We call him St. Paul now. Several thousands of the early Christians chose to go to the beasts of the Arena rather than to bow to the statues of the emperors or to burn incense to their images, although a mere gesture of reverence would have saved them from horrible deaths. We call them martyrs and saints now. The Saracens butchered millions of men and women who refused to kiss the Koran. When we ostracize a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">young boy and deprive him of the benefits of our</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">public schools (nonsectarian) </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">because he re</span><span class="font8">fuses to do what his parents taught him </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">wrong, are we showing more respect for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font8">vaunted liberty of conscience than did </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the Ro</span><span class="font8">mans and the Saracens? Those Jehovah’s witnesses are, apparently, law-abiding people. There is no law which enjoins saluting the flag. Liberty of conscience is written in the Bill of Rights, and if we must violate it to obtain </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">salute to the flag, the price is too great. And I venture to say that saluting the flag is not the only means, nor the best means, of teaching true patriotism. There is our history and the lives of our great men. Our school authorities do not seem to distinguish between patriotism and chauvinism. Nor does the moral discipline of our youth occupy a conspicuous place in their activities, with the lamentable results visible everywhere.—E. D. Berry,in the Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">E HAVE natural flowers and artificial flowers. The artificial flowers may look as • beautiful as the natural flowers, but they lack ' perfume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is real love that comes from the heart ■ and soul which is ready to sacrifice everything. There is also false love—love for the sake of <sup>1</sup> business—love to uphold the artificial blue blood. What a mockery!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just as there are two kinds of flowers and two kinds of love, there are two kinds of patriotism. True patriotism is within the heart and soul. No one can give it to you or take it away from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are other kinds of patriotism—“for profit—for selfish gain”—but the patriotism of Miss Grace Estep of Canonsburg, Pa., to my way of thinking, as I read her views: “I believe our government to be the grandest on earth and I love the principles set forth in our Constitution, but I think the present attitude of the school authorities is silly and affords a real cover for any real enemy who may choose to work against the national welfare while diligently saluting the flag”—is true, real, loyal, 100-percent American patriotism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">N MY judgment, the action of the school board of Canonsburg in dismissing this teacher and punishing her pupils for following the dictates of conscience was a violation of their oath of public office under the Constitution. Congress shall make no law regarding the establishment of religion nor prohibit the free exercise thereof. Such action of the school board is not only a violation of their oath of public office, but a usurpation of authority also.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">ITH all respect to the D.A.R., I venture to suggest that the Teachers’ Oath and compulsory flag salute are a denial of the very principles for which its distinguished ancestors fought and died; namely, “liberty and justice for all” (including, perhaps, even “Jehovah’s witnesses”).</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">PLEA to “stop persecuting little boys and young women teachers who, for reasons of conscience, will not salute the flag”, was made in an Armistice Day sermon by the Rev. Dr. Arthur C. Baldwin, pastor of the Chestnut Street Baptist church, 40th and Chestnut sts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At services in the church yesterday, Dr. Baldwin said that “today we rank among Public Enemies Number One many men who would salute the flag every day but whose whole plan of life is selfish and anti-social”. He reminded his congregation that the Romans persecuted those who “refused to drop the pinch of incense upon the altar”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Beware of a flag worship,” said Dr. Baldwin, “which puts the show above the substance and gives an exaggerated emphasis to a ceremonial. Saluting the flag as a reminder and recognition of a great and unique heritage is one thing. Making that act a final test of good citizenship is quite another. The real test is character, neighborliness, obedience to the fundamental laws. Without that, flag saluting is a farce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Patriotic organizations that are blacklisting such as the late Jane Addams, in the name of patriotism, would do well to get down to cases and fill their blacklists with profiteers, political judges, armament makers and a thousand other flag wavers who by life and influence are undermining the nation’s moral strength.”—Philadelphia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Bulletin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">SN’T it about time that somebody stood up in defense of these little school children who are being bullied by grown-up petty flag-saluters? Has our government become so bad that it has lost its appeal to reason, and can be sustained only by compelling formal oaths of allegiance upon mentally and physically helpless pupils, and upon economically helpless teachers? If our government has fallen so low, oaths of allegiance are broken reeds on which to lean, and if our government is really good and worthy of defense, oaths of allegiance are superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If our flag really stands for freedom and liberty within the law—as is supposed to be guaranteed us by the United States—then I should, and do, respect the government of which the flag is a symbol. But this thing of bullying little children who are too immature to know what it is all about smacks of tyranny—and rather silly tyranny at that. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If we must in our </span><span class="font8">day revert to the methods used </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by Gessler on </span><span class="font8">William Tell, why not go the whole way, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">force the parents of these non-flag-saluting </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">chil</span><span class="font8">dren to use crossbows to shoot apples off of the heads of their children?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">THE St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star Times</span><span class="font8"> quotes the Rev--L erend Edward Dowling, S.J., as saying the following in an address at the St. Louis University, the Jesuit institution of that city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The American revolution unseated monarchy in England and established it in the United States, ’ ’ he asserted. “Guided by Montesquieu’s philosophy, or blunderingly false observations of the British structure, our nation was constituted and frozen into a rigid constitution during a transitional period of ethics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The result was that while Pitt’s 1784 victory over Fox demoted the British king to the status of an archaic gargoyle, and the fluid and unwritten constitution enabled the British governmental structure to flow realistically, our static Constitution embalmed the monarchic idea of a strong executive.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Crossing his fingers and explaining that he regarded the American Constitution as the greatest achievement of a human group at any particular time—but not all time—Father Dowling listed his reasons for asserting that revolution did not give us a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“First,” he said, “it was a horizontal revolution between two groups of people on a horizontal plane. It was not a rising of the poor against the rich. Aristocrats like Hamilton, Charles Carroll, Baron DeKalb, Slave-master George Washington, Count Pulaski and Banker Morris fought against Rothschild’s Hessian cattle and the lowest of the cockney rabble.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Hang-overs of a Yellow Gang</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8"> WANT to say that I recognize no one who loves his country more than I love it, yet I have never saluted the flag, and never will, because my nature does not run to such idiocies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I went to the public schools, to the colleges of forty years ago, and not once was I ever instructed or demanded to salute the flag; yet I loved it as a symbol of my Government. The youth of that day were not vociferous in their cry of “loyalty”, nor did they seek to interpret another’s attitude or posture of body as reflecting his sentiments. One wants to laugh and shout when happy; another wants to be still and very quiet; while another always breaks down and cries when overjoyed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then how absurd to interpret one’s posture or manual behavior as indicating sentiments. The real truth about the matter is that there are hang-overs of that yellow gang who delighted in the recent war in making some German or German sympathizer ‘&quot;kiss the flag”. This, plus the feeling or thrill it gives “him” to march by with the flag while all about people are saluting, gives us this insanity and intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next thing, we will have to execute the fool nonsense of rising every time some jade of a politician or business leader enters a room, or passes, and will have to humiliate ourselves in the sand if the president passes or his name is mentioned!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nope. Regardless of what others may think, I am not a salutin’ citizen. I am too much a Jefferson type. Honoring men and things has no place in a nation of equals. A flag that must be saluted, that must have force used to get a salute, is a flag trailing in the dust—and my flag is not trailing, and no man shall dictate to me my sentiments nor how I shall express, them.— S.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘And Sing Loud!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt;&lt;/^ET patriotic, or else—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'J This is the gist of yesterday’s ultimatum to the teachers and pupils of Chicago’s public schools, as formulated by the high-minded patriots of a school board whose whole system has been one of the outstanding examples of political racketeering in the field of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The kiddies and their dear teachers are ordered to stand up, at a specified time every day, salute the flag, recite the pledge of allegiance, and sing the national anthem—“because,” the board’s order announces, “it is one of the primary objects of the board to instill in the minds of youth the loftiest ideals of patriotism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">School-board jobs in Chicago rate among the choicest plums in municipal politics, bitterly contested, expensively won—and in a great many instances very profitably occupied. The three-way school control sponsored by the board is perfectly adapted to the practices from which grafters profit. If love of country runs rampant among political chieftains of the system, it is of a kind which entails a minimum of personal sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the outfit, by the long-term record, which now orders the kids in school to stand up and sing the national anthem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And,” the board’s order might add, “when you sing, sing loud!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Loud singing, practiced gestures, words memorized under compulsion—these are the elements of the only kind of patriotism that the old-line politician understands. It is a regimented patriotism. It is a patriotism for appearance and effect. It is an easy patriotism. And, above all, it is a patriotism which does not enliven the private conscience or interfere with exploiting a public trust for personal profit.—San Diego (Calif.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Union.</span></p>

It seems to me obvious that their efforts will have exactly the contrary result. A child’s emotions must be spontaneous. Patriotism and love of country are emotions which must spring naturally from beliefs. They cannot be created by force or intimidation. Can one conceive of any course better calculated to produce communists, anarchists and wholly antisocial citizens? Undoubtedly the fear of the Russian type of communism is back of this whole movement. Could anything be more stupid, illogical and subversive of all that our country stands for, than to adopt the methods and technique of communistic Russia as a means of combatting communism? Is it not inevitable that the intuitions of youth will grasp the fact that Americans who preach the doctrine of freedom and liberty, but apply the practices of suppression, are hollow hypocrites, not really believing in the institutions upon which their government and society are founded?—Robert E.

<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font8">ROBABLY the world’s worst case of hysteria was the spell that seized this country in 1917 and held it in bondage for several years. When the storm had spent its fury it was to be hoped that sanity would return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now it seems that before we reach a normal state we are to be whipped back into the old madness. All this fuss and feathers about our flag is sickening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I love my country and I cherish its flag, the banner that stands for the protection that makes life worth while; the emblem of the greatest nation of the earth. We should teach others to love this country, and respect for the flag will follow that love. But our present procedure is making our flag an emblem of tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You love your mother, of course, and cherish her picture. How would you like to be compelled to kiss her picture? How would you like to be compelled to kiss your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When I was a child my teachers taught a patriotism that was free of hysteria. We had no flag worship. No child was asked to salute the flag.

<p><span class="font7">“Democracies, when they are in sound health, are tolerant. When they become intolerant, something is wrong. English tolerance toward political and social dissent in peace time is well known.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even in war, he added, “England meets the test.” “In no other country could a man who had taken an antiwar position during the war been elevated to the highest executive office within five years, as was Ramsay MacDonald.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font8">T IS to be hoped that the members of the Lakewood school board will keep their selfrespect by<sup>7</sup> refusing to expel the Sperling boy for refusing to salute the flag as required by a rather silly law. It’s obvious from your news story last evening that the reason for the boy’s action is not in conflict with the intent of the law. And even if it were, most of us are under the impression that the reason for public schools is that they are expected to train in citizenship.

<p><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">HA</span><span class="font8">T a relief! Apparently no communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of us were led to suspect that our schools and colleges harbored dangerous radicals, communists, people determined to overthrow our form of government. Amid shouting and tumult, charges and counter-charges, salute and oath laws were passed which were designed to test the loyalty and patriotism of teachers and pupils, laws which would smoke out the dangerous characters who would, obviously, fail to meet such a test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So far, the only persons smoked out, to the writer’s knowledge, are a teacher and some children who, solely for religious reasons, declined to conform, in the belief that they should not pledge allegiance to any earthly authority. They certainly have a courage of conviction which would be creditable to any patriot and church member, though the nature of their conviction is not popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The writer is relieved to regain a previous confidence that our schools and colleges are doing more than all other agencies combined to build sound patriotism and that we do not need to worry about our teachers and professors. Maybe we do need to worry a little about the growing tendency to crack down on people who act, think and speak in an unusual and unpopular manner, remembering that the unusual and ■unpopular have many times meant progress for man.—Hugh Nixon, in the Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The chief representatives of the Devil are the organized churches. The more loosely organized denominations are not quite so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Naturally, if the Devil runs this country, the stars and stripes belong to him, so no true Jehovah’s witness can salute the flag or pledge allegiance to it “and the country for which it stands”. This is consistent, and teachers should not be asked or allowed to meddle with the religious beliefs of children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is little enough willingness to sacrifice for one’s belief in the world, and even if those who claim tolerance are themselves intolerant, we cannot afford to lower our standards of religious liberty. Least of all should children be troubled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">HAT does prove somewhat surprising— possibly terrifying—is the fact that even in little Williamstown, having a population of less than four thousand, the recent demand for oaths of loyalty from teachers and pupils brought to light several supporters of the sect known as the “witnesses of Jehovah”. The oath campaign of 1935 promised to unearth many a hitherto hidden lair of Communists and Sedi-tionists in Massachusetts. Thus far, according to all reports in the news columns, the chief result of this effort has been to give the “witnesses” a brighter and broader day in the public eye than they had ever had before. Indeed, their very existence had formerly been unsuspected. Now we know the power which we must reckon with, whether it be a child in Lynn or several children in Williamstown.—The Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Transcript.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">U</span><span class="font8">P TO date no teacher of Communistic leaning has been known to refuse to take the oath. We are unable to believe that there are no supporters of Communism in the school system of the United States. It appears that taking such an oath would not trouble a Communist. On the contrary, it might prove an advantage by serving as a cloak of virtue with which to allay suspicion and allow such a person to spread propaganda with greater freedom. Compulsory prohibition did not work out too well. It is reasonable to question if compulsory patriotism will ever be more than “oath” deep.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Saluting a Flag </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This address, which created such nation-wide interest, is obtainable on transcription records. These records are too large for use on phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C</span><span class="font8">HILDREN of true Christians have declined to salute the United States flag. The Associated Press has requested me to express my view of the matter. This I do from the Bible viewpoint. To many persons the saluting of the flag is merely a formalism and has little or no significance. To those who sincerely consider it from the Scriptural standpoint, it means much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flag, representatively, stands for the visible ruling powers. To attempt by law to compel a citizen or child of a citizen to salute any object or thing is entirely unfair and wrong. Laws are made and enforced to prevent the commission of wrongful overt acts that result in injury to another, and are not made for the purpose of compelling a person to violate his conscience, and particularly when that conscience is directed in harmony with Jehovah God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The refusal to salute the flag, and to stand mute, as those children did, could injure no one. If one sincerely believes that God’s commandment is against the saluting of flags, then to compel that person to salute a flag contrary to the Word of God, and contrary to his conscience, works a great injury to that person. The state has no right by law or otherwise to work injury to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For many centuries Satan the Devil has been the invisible ruler of the nations of the earth. God has permitted him to so act in order to put a test upon the human race and to determine how many will serve God willingly and how many will serve the Devil. For that reason Jehovah God gives this commandment to those who will receive His favor (Exodus 20: 3,4, 5): “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any . . . image, . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” Compulsory flag-saluting is a religious ceremony in direct violation of this law of God. It is an attempt to compel the practice of a religion contrary to the United States Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the third chapter of Daniel the Divine Record states that in violation of God’s law the government of Babylon made a law commanding all persons, when the national hymn was played, to fall down and worship before a certain image and that those who refused would be put to death in a fiery furnace. Three Hebrews who had covenanted to serve Jehovah God refused to obey that commandment, and said to the king: ‘We have no need to obey you in this matter, and if it be that you cast us into the fire, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace, and He will deliver us.’ The test was on. The three Hebrews were cast into the furnace; and because of their faithfulness God delivered them, and thus put His disapproval upon emblem-saluting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The present-day attempt to compel school children and others who believe in and serve Jehovah God to salute any flag is exactly in line with the Babylonish law just mentioned. To salute a flag means, in effect, that the person saluting ascribes salvation to what that flag represents; whereas salvation is of Jehovah God. The Hitler government, now a stench in the nostrils of all honest people, requires all persons of Germany to give a certain salute and to cry out, “Heil, Hitler”; and those who refuse to do so are severely punished. At the present time hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison in Germany because they decline to ascribe salvation to Hitler. They trust in Jehovah God and in Christ Jesus, and not in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are men and women who have fully pledged themselves to obey the commandments of God and Christ Jesus. They fully comply with the commandment of Jesus who said: “Render therefore unto Cfesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.” (Luke 20:25) The meaning of that declaration of Jesus is this: Jehovah God is supreme, and His law is above all human laws. “Caesar” stands for the state or human law. All laws of the state that are not in conflict with God’s law should be gladly obeyed by all who are devoted to Jehovah God. When the law of the state is in conflict with the law of Jehovah, then the Christian cannot obey that law of man. The apostles of Christ Jesus placed this exact construction upon the words of Jesus. In answer to charges of violating the law of the state they said to the high court: “Whether it be right in the sight of God [for us] to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. ... We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 4:</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">19; </span><span class="font8">5: 29) Jehovah’s witnesses take </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that same stand. </span><span class="font8">They gladly obey every law of the land which is not in conflict with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s law. </span><span class="font8">But </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">law of man is in direct conflict with God’s law they cannot and will not comply therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is written, at Romans 13:1: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers’’; and many wrongfully hold that “the higher powers” are the visible rulers of the nations of earth. That scripture, however, is addressed to the followers of Christ Jesus, and to no others. The “higher powers” to them are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and every true follower of Christ Jesus must obey God in preference to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flag of the United States is not the flag of God and Christ. It is the emblem of the power that rules the nation; and no one can truthfully say that God and Christ Jesus rule a government where crime is rampant. Men organize governments, and Satan the Devil overreaches and rules them because of their refusal to obey God, and hence the nations of the world are under the control of Satan the Devil, as stated in 1 John 5:19: ‘We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil one.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Weymouth)</span><span class="font8"> In proof of this Jesus says that the Devil is the invisible ruler of the world. (John 14:30) Satan, the god of this world, offered to give Jesus the world upon condition that Jesus would fall down and worship the Devil. Jesus refused and said (Matthew 4:10): “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At John 18:36 He said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” Jesus directed His followers to pray to God saying (Matthew 6:9-12): ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ Jehovah’s witnesses are true followers of Christ Jesus and must obey His commandments. To them the Lord says (John 15:19): “Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 8:23) “I am not of this world.” (John 14:21) “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.” Concerning His followers it is written in the Scriptures (Philippians 3:20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.), </span><span class="font8">“For our citizenship is in heaven.” (1 Corinthians 10:14) “Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.” This commandment is based upon the commandment at Exodus 20: 4, 5.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Fate</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are in a solemn covenant or agreement to obey God and Christ Jesus, and for them to break that covenant means their destruction ; as it is written, in Romans 1:31, 32, that ‘covenant-breakers are worthy of death’. At Acts 3: 23 they are told that ‘every one who does not obey Christ shall be destroyed’. When Jesus was about to be put to death the Roman governor pointed to Jesus and said to the Jews: “Behold your King”; and the Jews answered, “We have no king but Csesar.” (John 19:14,15) They were in a covenant to obey God. Their repudiation of their covenant resulted in their destruction. The question to each of Jehovah’s witnesses therefore is: “Shall I obey every command of man and die, or shall I obey Jehovah God and live?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a religious sect or cult. They are true followers of Christ Jesus. The Bible is their only creed. God has given them a flag, which is His message of truth. (Psalm 20: 5) Jehovah commands His witnesses to “lift up a standard for the people” (Isaiah 62:10), meaning that His witnesses must raise God’s standard of truth and point to that as the only salvation of man. Every nation has a different standard; and therefore none of these are God’s standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Pilgrim fathers left the oppressive nations in Europe and fled to America because of their sincere desire to be free to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. Now an oppressive rule is attempted to be enforced that takes away the liberty of the citizen to worship God as God has commanded that man shall worship. No one is injured by a man conscientiously serving God as he is commanded by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Supreme Court of the United States, in Church vs. United States, 143 U.S. 457, authoritatively ruled that the American government is a Christian nation. That decision requires the nation to recognize the law of God as superior to the law of man, and where the two are in conflict the Christian must obey the law of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the ships that ply the seas the Roman Catholic service is held. At that service the flag of the pope is displayed above the flag of the United States. The United States Senate went on record in February, 1929, as favoring the right of the flag of the pope to be thus displayed. A senator, supporting that action, said: “I for one refuse to depart from the time-honored American custom of placing the emblem of God above every other emblem of the world. I will not run down the pennant of God for any other emblem.” The Senate, by a vote of 68 to 19, sustained the senator in that position. The United States government is therefore estopped from saying that the flag of the United States should be honored above Jehovah God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The children in question have been taught by their parents to serve and obey Jehovah. They have made a wise choice, declaring themselves for Jehovah God and His kingdom of righteousness. All who love God will do the same thing. (Revelation 7: 9,10) Real American citizens, who obey the fundamental law of the land, believe in freedom of thought and freedom of speech, and, above all, in the right of man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. It is foolish to attempt to make good citizens by compelling them to act as hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of the schools’ giving time and attention to the formalism of flag-saluting they should give attention to the study and understanding of God’s Word, that the children may be guided in the right way. Men must be consistent in order to teach the children honesty. Children, because they love and serve God, refuse to salute the flag, and are severely whipped to make them “good citizens”. The president of the United States swears to uphold the Constitution. The Supreme Court decides that he has violated his oath by going contrary to the Constitution. The president denounces the Supreme Court and relegates the Constitution to the “horse and buggy days” and many applaud his action. If his solemn oath will not compel the president to obey the law, how much good will be accomplished by using physical force to compel God-fearing children to salute the flag?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Public officials manifest inconsistency, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">Rome loves to have it so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For more than 150 years honest Americans have obeyed the law without being compelled to salute the flag. Why the burning zeal to now enforce a religious ceremony by compelling flagsaluting? The reason is this: The same power that caused Fascism and Hitlerism to seize governments in Europe is moving to seize control of the American institutions, and the policy of compulsory flag-saluting is but a part in that program to put fear into the minds of the people and compel submission to an arbitrary dictator; and this is being done at the instance of the Hierarchy, operating from Rome, and prosecuting its scheme to rule the whole earth. It has its political ambassadors in almost all countries. On March 8,1934, a special cable dispatch from Rome to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font8"> states that a definite agreement has been reached by President Roosevelt and the Vatican and that diplomatic relations shall be established between the United States and the “Holy See” as soon as public opinion in America can be brought around to the idea. Compulsory saluting of the flag is in line with Hitlerism, and a part of the studied, diabolical effort to bring the people around to the Roman idea. It is high time that the loyal and faithful American people realized this great peril. True and honest men of America, in which class Jehovah’s witnesses are included, do not need shotgun methods or prisons to compel them to do what is right.</span></p>

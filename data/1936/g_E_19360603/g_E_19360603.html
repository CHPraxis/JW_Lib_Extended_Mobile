<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Philistia [Catholic Action] a Murderess for 1500 Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the reasons why Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font10"> is the most important book of this generation is that it is the first publication to positively identify Philistia, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, as the greatest enemy of righteousness in the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In that book, page 278, Judge Rutherford says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Heretofore the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had its own way. It has been a great test to the true followers of Christ Jesus. That wicked organization, acting under the pretext of being God’s representatives on earth, has crushed every organization that has ever risen against it.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360603_files/g_E_19360603-2.png" alt="" style="width:228pt;height:262pt;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Honey, we’ve been (hlc) drunk together for fifteen centuries for the (hlc) advancement of civilization.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Because their minds have been blinded by the Devil the human familylearnmore slowly than seems possible to imagine. Who would suppose that it could have in its midst for 1500 years an institution with an unbroken record for murder and not identify it for what it is ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everybody knows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims that the kingdoms of this world constitute the component parts of Christ’s Kingdom and that the subjects of these kingdoms are or should rightfully be subjects of the Hierarchy and dependent upon it for spiritual guidance and salvation. Yet the Roman Hierarchy has always consented to war, which is mass murder.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">547</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">No doubt, having the blasphemous and pretentious claims of the Roman Hierarchy in mind, President Tyler Dennett, of Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The human mind has not devised an adequate alternative by which human life as it changes, sometimes expanding in healthy life and sometimes degenerating in decadence, can be adapted to existing institutions. It must be clearly apparent to all thoughtful observers that this worship of force, this exaltation of the military and coercive power of the state, has poisoned the public life and thought of our day. The saddest aspect of the present-day life is the complacence with which free citizens acquiesce in the curtailment of their liberties. It is not a healthy sign.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Ethiopia a Case in Point</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">When Mussolini announced his intention to seize Ethiopia he made no bones of the fact that his motive was thoroughly selfish. If the pope represented Christ as he claims to represent Him, he had a chance when the war first broke out to take his stand by the side of the Prince of Peace, even if it meant to suffer martyrdom. It is no more for a pope to suffer martyrdom than it is for a carpenter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the pope is not the representative of Christ. Instead, he is the representative of the Devil. His first pronouncement was that he hoped for •'justice” in the contest. He hoped for nothing of the sort. What he hoped was that Mussolini would win and that similar methods will win all over the world and bring the nations to his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is enough truth afloat in these days that even the Catholic journalists could plainly see the pope’s opportunity and his failure to grasp it. Thus the Catholic </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reichspost</span><span class="font10"> of Vienna said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Italy is not only a Catholic country, with Catholicism its official religion. Rome harbors both Italy's government and the head of the Catholic church. It will be difficult to explain to the Asian rice farmer and the African goatherder the peculiar status of Vatican City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When it became certain that the invasion of Ethiopia was only a matter of a few weeks a congress of 2,000 Catholic nurses called to see the pope at his summer home, and were urged not to let their neutrality hinder them from rendering enthusiastic service on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the church bells in Italy, including those of St. Peter’s, rang when war was declared against Ethiopia. The pope, however, explained that while the other church bells rang to call the people to war, St. Peter’s rang for a different reason. But probably nobody believed that, not even the pope himself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>“Christians&quot; vs. Catholics</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Coptic priests have led the people of Ethiopia far from the letter and spirit of Christianity. Nevertheless, the Ethiopians claim that this war is a war between Christians and Catholics, with themselves as the Christians and the Italians as the Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Portuguese explorers were much surprised in A.D. 1490 when they found an unknown land with a church on every hill or sightly piece of land. Between 1490 and 1630 Jesuit priests came in large numbers, and in 1626 prevailed upon the then emperor Susenyos to issue orders that the people must accept the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church. This they refused to do, and thousands were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Susenyos was forced to abdicate, and his son Fasilidas restored the rights of the people to worship as they had done for centuries before they even knew there was such a thing as a pope. To this day the Ethiopians, in grateful memory of Fasilidas, when they cross a bridge named after him, and which is still in use, all say, “May God have mercy on the soul of Emperor Fasilidas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Ethiopians to this day hold the memory of the Jesuit priests in disesteem. To gain possession of this extremely churchy country is one of the ambitions of the pope, and sufficiently accounts for the encouragement he has given to Mussolini to pursue his Ethiopian objectives. Meanwhile he showed some diplomatic benevolence by directing that the Italian Catholic mission at Addis Ababa be turned over to the Ethiopians for use as a hospital for wounded Ethiopian soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the war got under way many of the more intelligent and independent editors, as, for instance, the editor of the Huntington (W.Va.) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser,</span><span class="font10"> made inquiry,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What would be the effect, we wonder, if the Roman Catholic church would threaten to excommunicate all Italian communicants who took up arms against Abyssinia [Ethiopia] ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Seeing that the pope was caught in a jam between Italian sentiment for war, on the one hand, and the consciences of all the rest of the world, on the other, the Roman Catholic archbishop, Arthur Hinsley, of Westminster, England, tried to dodge, for himself and for th? pope, by saying that the pope is a helpless old man and could do nothing as respects the Italo-Ethiopian war. This strange admission was made in the face of the fact that the pope claims to be the vicar of Christ and by his triple-crown advertises himself as emperor of heaven, earth and hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The plain fact of the business is that the pope backed Mussolini in his Ethiopian campaign morally (?) and financially with the hope and expectation that Italy would win the war, in which case he expects the Jesuits to regain control of Ethiopia’s religious business, and give the Roman Catholic Hierarchy the master key to the “Dark Continent”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Blessing Instruments of Murder</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Many American papers have carried pictures taken in Ethiopia showing Italian Roman Catholic priests blessing tanks used and intended to be used in the murder of tlieir fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Neus,</span><span class="font10"> under the caption of “The Soul Is Not Forgotten as II Duce’s Men March On”, contains a picture of an “Altar” mounted on a tank, with a typical hypocrite standing behind the candles and cross withe which, apparently, he cannot carry on his business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font10"> carried a dispatch from Rome reciting that, in a competition open to the whole country, the bishop of Civita Casteliana, Orte and Gallese was awarded the first prize for propaganda, but returned the award to Mussolini to help forward the war. At the same time, so says the dispatch of the British United Press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the bishop removed his gold beads and pectoral cross and handed them to the premier, declaring that the entire Roman Catholic clergy of Italy had invoked the blessing of God on the Italian troops and prayed constantly for victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The archbishop of Taranto, Italy, is well pleased. He declares that Italian troops are advancing in East Africa as pioneers of civilization, with the elan of the ancient Roman empire and the noble sentiments of its successor, “Christian” Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Joao Becker, Roman Catholic archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, is reported as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I pray to God that in the present international controversy that intrepid Italy, land of genius, science and art, may not be humiliated. I also pray to God to protect Fascist Rome, the pope’s Rome, eternal Rome, Christianity’s seat. Can anyone contest Italy’s right in this matter when, in the last analysis, the entire question hinges upon equitable redistribution of colonial domains among European countries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All these things show that in all parts of the earth the Roman cult is at one with Mussolini in his rape of Ethiopia.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Roman Hierarchy Double-crosses the League</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Never for peace at any time, the Roman Hierarchy upset the British plan for peace. When that apostle of “sanctions”, Great Britain, sought to use the League of Nations and discourage Italy from doing in Ethiopia what Britain has done in every corner of the world, the pope broke up the party as cleverly as any burglar ever jimmied a safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Without the knowledge or consent of the League the pope’s man Monsignor Luigi Ma-glione, then a bishop, now a cardinal, persuaded France and Britain to offer to split Ethiopia in half and thus end the war by giving Italy much of what she wants. The plan did not go through, but it virtually destroyed the League of Nations, and it placed Anthony Eden, whose sympathies are largely Roman Catholic, in virtual control of the British Empire. The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font10"> said pointedly and savagely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While in Geneva Mr. Eden was pursuing, to all appearance, the straight course of a League policy, while on the platform ministers were pledging themselves over and over again to that policy, a secret diplomacy was at work behind the scenes. Quietly a plot was being hatched to sabotage and destroy the work which ■was being done in the open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Hierarchy tried in vain to put the blame for this act of treachery upon the Masons, whom they have attacked so savagely in Italy and Germany. In their hue and cry after Jehovah’s witnesses, and anybody and everybody else that they think stands across their path to worlddomination, the Jesuits are not forgetting the Masons, so signally marked for attack in Italy and Germany by the Fascist forces, and so one reads in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> the parenthetical comment of Sir Norman Angell:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Believe it or not, Freemasons are much favored in France at this moment as the scapegoat in the present Italo-Ethiopian war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This, of course, is Hierarchy propaganda, put out to throw the public off the scent as to the identity of the real originators of the Italo-Ethiopian contest, the Roman Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Singapore (Straits Settlements) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune </span><span class="font10">said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The League of Nations is dead. All that we can do is to bury it decently. The League of Nations could not succeed because it was based on two false assumptions—that the people of the world were willing to give up fighting and that the governments of the world represented high-minded and unselfish interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Foreseeing that the League of Nations is done for, the presidents of Colombia, Guatemala and Dominican Republic have suggested a proposed Association of American Nations for the government of the Western world. The plan is endorsed by the heads of 17 other South American and Central American States. The suggestion is made that such an association or league would most certainly be under the direct control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">German papers accuse the Austrians of being under Jesuit control, which is no doubt as true in one land as in the other. Public notices have been posted in Austria that all persons must register as being on the government’s side or be counted as state enemies and be treated as citizens of inferior rights. This is characteristic of countries under the thumb of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">A careful study of the drawing on this page shows the ‘‘Holy&quot; Roman Empire in process of reconstruction. The details are worthy of the closest scrutiny, from the hands of Gog, the prime minister, at the top, to the blueprint and the conspirators at the bottom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the title “What Is Fascism?” from the pen of David Wilkie, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> has twice published the facts as to how the Roman Hierarchy is moving “with great velocity” to bring the entire world under its control. Having had fifteen hundred years of active co-operation with the Devil the Hierarchy is more suited to his purposes than any other institution. It knows how to call to its assistance the munition linns which control the governments, the politicians which do their bidding, the newspapers which extol their acts of folly, and the clergy of the Devil, both Catholic and Protestant, that are ever ready to do the will of their father.— John 8:44.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rebuilding the “Holy” Roman Empire</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The newspapers contain many stories of “persecution” of Catholics in Germany, but at an interview in Madison, Wisconsin, Dr. Hans Luther, German ambassador to the L’nited States, when questioned about such persecutions, said angrily, “There is nothing of the kind.” This statement was no doubt the absolute truth. Why should Hitler persecute his fellow Catholics and thus mar the partnership between himself and the pope that made his seizure of Protestant Germany possible ? The ones that are really being persecuted in Germany are Jehovah's witnesses, and Jehovah alone is their shield and their exceeding great reward.—Genesis 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Devil is not clever enough to cover his any very great anxiety to even make the attempt. Thus, the pope telegraphed Hitler his congratulations when the latter occupied the left bank of the Rhine in violation of Germany’s treaty obligations. And at the very time that the newspapers were carrying stories of the arrest in Germany of 150 Catholic priests for possessing and circulating Communist literature Hitler telegraphed congratulations to the pope regardingsomethingof interest in the pope’s life or priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Hierarchy is so far in control of the British Empire that the present king of England is the first in centuries to fail to state in his oath of office that he will protect and defend the Protestant faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The People</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are Unhappy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rule of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is intended to benefit the Hierarchy; it is not intended to benefit the people. The natural effect is that the Hierarchy has everything and the common people have next to nothing. They are not even allowed to see the films that they wish to see or to read the books that they wish to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How the Ratti-Hitler and Ratti-Mussolini partnerships work in practice is shown by meatless and butterless Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in Germany, and meatless Tuesdays and Wednesdays in Italy. Also, in Italy, there are stringent rules as to quantities of meat that may be served in hotels, restaurants and dining cars. After a while some bright Dominican will probably suggest that there is no need to worry about the meat supply so long as guillotines can be made and operated so cheaply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In all seriousness Charles Morgan, London correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> declares that there are now more martyrs of conscience in Europe than in the fiercest period of the Inquisition. What he did not say, and perhaps did not know, is that the persecuting power is the same now as it was then, and is taking advantage of human distress and weakness to make the pope once again the master of the world. This time the scheme will fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Quebec is unhappy. Charges were publicly made against Abbe Lavergne, and suit was brought by political opponents, that he had represented it to his followers as a mortal sin to vote otherwise than as he dictated. As soon as news of the suit got out the Abbe Lavergne went to a hospital to attract sympathy for himself. In the hospital, surrounded by every comfort that his foolish parishioners could bestow upon him, it was the easiest thing in the world for him to send out verbal slop about his great peace and joy in thinking about “Christmas” instead of the election which he had tried to control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ontario is unhappy. Thus the Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Telegram</span><span class="font10"> said editorially of this bunch of highwaymen in black nightgowns:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We can subscribe to Roman Catholic charities, do business with Roman Catholics on the same basis as we do with Protestants, employ dozens of Roman Catholics in our business and treat them with utmost fairness—but dare to oppose them in any matter of principle or public policy and we are ‘bigots’, and are promptly damned with ‘bell, book and candle’. We believe in living in peace and amity with our Catholic friends—we have Catholic friends—but the official mouthpieces of the Catholic church make it very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The statement is often made that the Catholic church is not in politics. One wonders, therefore, just what particular thing it is in in the province of Ontario when it circularizes every parish in the province that Catholics could not vote for either one of two parties named, and in many parochial schools the children were taught to pray for the fall of the government.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Pressure in the United States</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">No government wishes to be subjected to constant irritating pressure from one group. The Knights of Columbus have made a nuisance of themselves by their repeated insistence that the United States embroil itself in Mexico’s internal affairs. Not only has the Roman Catholic archbishop McNicholas said in effect that nothing that the Knights of Columbus have to say on the subject is of any interest to anybody, but the Mexican government itself, in an open letter, published in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font10"> said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a fact not denied that, in our past history, the Catholic church, through its spiritual conquests, had attained a political hegemony of such extent that at one time it had in its hands not less than four-fifths of all the property in the country, to the regrettable detriment of Mexico’s inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same open letter accused the Roman Catholic clergy of appealing for freedom of conscience, whereas that same clergy condemned such freedom as opposed to its fundamental dogma, applying this criterion in its cruelest form by means of the inquisition. It accused the church directly of instigating and supporting most crueLinternal conflicts in Mexico, and asserted that the church was guilty even of treason in seeking and aiding foreign invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Heinrich Bruening, former leader of the Catholic Centre party of Germany, and one-time chancellor, last fall spent several weeks in America, closeted with Catholics, apparently discussing some great plan they had in hand. While in America Bruening’s presence was concealed. After his return to Germany it was announced he would be back this spring; and one naturally wonders what is his mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Father E. J. Higgins, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Astoria, Queens, Long Island, N. Y., claims that whereas Roman Catholics are only one-seventh of the total population of the United States, yet in the Great Foolishness of 1917-1918 they comprised 42 percent of all the American soldiers and more than 50 percent of all the naval men. Assuming that this statement is correct, why is it that Catholics are so much more eager than any other people to show their contempt for Him who said, “Blessed are the peacemakers”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Buffalo the Reverend Carlo Celotto, pastor of St. Anthony’s church, baptized an American flag. This is plainly paganism, the attempt to graft a new and godless “religion” upon the American people, and, instead of being meekly accepted, as the Germans accepted Swastikaism, should be most indignantly rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Los Angeles </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner</span><span class="font10"> mentions that there are “seven Jesuit provinces in the United States”. This is all a part of the arrangements for taking over the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an address before the Miami Police Benevolent Association, Andrew J. Kavanaugh, director of public safety, said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The German government stands out today as a paragon of police efficiency. German methods, I believe, can and should be put into effect in Miami. I believe every Miamian should be required to register at police headquarters as well as to be mugged and fingerprinted. In this way, we could have on file a complete record of our citizens as well as all pertinent information regarding them and their whereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A necessary feature of the modern inquisition will doubtless be the fingerprinting of everybody, barring priests, politicians and plutocrats.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Co-operation Between Clergy and Laity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the pope’s latest encyclical he says, “The close co-operation between the clergy and laity involved in Catholic Action is strongly approved.” Catholic Action includes such efforts at throttling free speech as were made to get Judge Rutherford put off the air. Additionally, it is interested in replacing Protestant postmasters and other employees with Catholics, even if less efficient, wherever it can be accomplished by fair means or foul. It includes boycotting radio stations that broadcast anything, regardless of how true it is, that displeases the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or wounds their “religious susceptibilities”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pope extended his blessing to the United States and its rulers (the people?). This blessing was supposed to come via the virgin Mary, Michael the Archangel, John the Baptist, the holy apostles, Peter, Paul, and all the saints. Not sure if a radio blessing works the same as the other kind, but in six months after the pope blessed Woodrow Wilson he was a helpless cripple, and when he blessed the Charity Bazaar at Paris it took fire within a few minutes and 150 women were burned to death. The pope’s blessing usually works this way; scores of examples can be cited, so look out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every effort is being made to get the United States in as a part of the revived “Holy” Roman Empire, twentieth-century style, but the same underneath as it was in the Dark Ages, when millions of victims suffered because of faithfulness to principle or devotion to Jehovah God. The Hierarchy has not changed, and will not change, because it does not want to change. It is the same power for evil and misery that it has always been. Its complete annihilation is imminent.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Coughlin and Catholic Action</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Everybody knows that Coughlin is trying to seize control of the United States. Those who enjoy what the Yankees call horseplay, and what the Europeans call camouflage, enjoy his sudden outbursts against Roosevelt. These outbursts are all the more ridiculous in view of the fact that the assassination of Huey Long was of such interest to both ends of the partnership that Coughlin hastened to tell Roosevelt of Senator Long’s death personally. Coughlin readily perceives that the American people are easily bamboozled, and no doubt gets a big kick out of his part in the performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Chicago twelve men, Cardinal Mundelein one of them, have seized the purse strings of the city. This is Fascism, pure and simple. Fascist elements other than the cardinal in this scheme are the presidents of four banks, four newspapers and advertising agencies, two packers, and one railway. The people of Chicago, the taxpayers, are tied hand and foot. They can have only what these twelve men consent to give them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Always for War, Never for Peace</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The pickings of the Hierarchy are usually more in times of war, and so they usually prefer war. That they really could do something for peace, if they were the least bit interested in peace itself, is shown by what happened in southern Ireland when they thought there was a chance that the kaiser could win. The priests compelled 2,000,000 Irishmen to swear they would not obey the conscription act. They were all afraid they would be sent to hell if they disobeyed the priests, and that is one reason why American boys were conscripted to take their places in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who were educated or who have lived under the influence of the Roman Hierarchy, as is the case with Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the “first lady of the land”, do not see the horror of the Devil's civilization in the proper light. The college girls who waited upon her, telling her they were of the Gold Star Mothers of Veterans of Future Wars and would like free trips to France so that they might see where their future sons would be buried, were truly patriotic in the most absolute, complete and perfect sense of the word. They caused no end of laughter at the expense of the munition-makers and the super-patriots that are under their hegemony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mrs. Roosevelt did not rise to the occasion. She had the opportunity of a lifetime to stand squarely behind these courageous and sensible young women. Instead, she reprimanded them, prefacing her reprimand with the infantile pabulum about its being “just as funny as it can be” and “a grand pricking of lots of bubbles”. Then she let it be known that she believes in war, saying, “There are certain things that are sacred, and you don’t make fun of them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The White House glorifying the Morgan-Wilson nonsense of 1914-1918</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">To a logical mind, reasoning along that line, it naturally follows that the following are, by inference, “sacred”: The World War; war profiteering; the cruel loss to mothers, wives and sweethearts; the death of soldiers on the battlefield; the wounding and maiming of men, women and children, and the shellshocking of the same; the shedding of tons upon tons of human blood; shells and bullets flying on their deadly mission; the orphaning of children; starving of noncombatants ; hospital bombing; spreading of disease, especially venereal; the preaching of bloodlust and hate; bargaining over the price of human blood; the squandering of untold billions of the people’s wealth, wrung from them by force and violence; all the official acts of the wartime officials (not to mention the strategical blunders by army officers that caused the death of millions); and after the war: the continued drive for bonuses by professional legionnaires; the oompah of the brass band that accompanied the gold-star mothers and the bribe that it was; and, finally, the author and instigator of it all, Satan himself. (The dictionary defines “sacred” as referring to that which is devoted to Jehovah. To blame Him for the World War, by saying that it was for His sake, is to defame His holy name.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Hierarchy Must Be Reckoned With</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">All lovers of peace instinctively know that the Roman Hierarchy is for war, and not for peace, and that it must be reckoned with in any peace moves. To be sure, the pope did send a radio blessing to his eucharistic show in Peru in which he hypocritically said, “God wills that the Christian spirit of true peace be spread over Europe and over Africa,” but this was at the very time when he was backing Mussolini morally and financially in his African venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The correct view of the Roman Hierarchy is that nothing that it does is ever honest, ever sincere, ever true. The mantle of hypocrisy covers its every move. Whenever it can do so it uses Protestants to glorify itself. Thus Dr. John Milton Phillips, of Connecticut, proposed a “Truce of God”, a prominent feature of which was an appeal to Pope Pius XI by Greek Catholics, Lutherans, the Federal Council of Churches, etc., that there shall be no war for five years. The Federal Council of Churches, however, was not willing to go along on the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Eight months later George Lansbury, British labor leader, proposed another “Truce of God”, and started it out the same way by an appeal to Pope Pius XI. This time the proposition was that all the churches were to get together at a world congress of religions in Jerusalem, and from Mount Calvary call a “Truce of God” and bid the war spirit to rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This Jerusalem setting for the &quot;Truce of God” propaganda is especially interesting in view of the fact that for generations, while the Turks had control of the country, these heathen gentlemen had to have armed guards at all the principal shrines, especially that of the so-called “Holy Sepulchre”, to keep the professed Christians, Roman and Greek Catholics, and other schismatics, from murdering one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Quite likely both of these “Truce of God” plans originated in the fertile brains of the Jesuits, an important part of whose job is to keep the Protestants busy with idle and foolish words while they deprive them of their liberties. There is no certain proof of it, but it looks likely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An agreement has been reached between Ratti and Mussolini by which, in case of air raids, Vatican City will go dark along with all the rest of the country. The pope is having a bomb-proof shelter made in the Vatican gardens, where he and all the residents of his little burg can hide in case of an air attack.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Bullding Up to an Awful Letdown”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">When people that believe in killing one another get caught in an emergency they show plainly the spirit of their master, the Devil. Lum’s restaurant, New York city, burned while the Roman Hierarchy’s “Holy Name Society”, consisting of some 20 priests and other men and women, 100 in all, were having a party, dinner and dance. When the fire broke out pandemonium ensued, and the newspaper accounts show that the holy (?) participants acted like wild beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Men and women were pushed from all sides, were trampled, were piled in struggling heaps and were stripped to the waist. One man had his shoes torn off; another fell on the stairs and was pushed all the way down on his chest; one girl escaped without her shoes and stockings. (There is some doubt as to when all this stripping occurred, however.) Seven died or were killed, and 35 were injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> did its usual job of playing up the Roman church in a “glorious” manner, even in this disgraceful scene; for it published the account of the wretched and shameful panic under the title “Heroism of Priest Saves Many Lives”. Subsequently they even published one of his pictures. Anything! Anything to gain a little notoriety.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Self-confessed Murderers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Glasgow </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald, </span><span class="font10">commenting on an address delivered in that city by Dr. G. A. Frank Knight, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He stated that it was an undeniable fact that whereas all other churches had in modern times abjured principles of intolerance and persecution as being contrary to the law of Christ, the Church of Rome by recent legislation had maintained the medieval claim to exterminate heretics by force. That this is no mere piece of imagination he showed from a large number of recent declarations made by church authorities at the Vatican, in which it was stated that “the Church, being perfect, must kill, and killing heretics is the only efficient remedy”. This was announced in 1900 by Father Marianus de Luca, professor of Canon Law in the Papal University in Rome, and it was followed by the official statement of Cardinal Lepicier in 1910, who stated that the Church of Rome held that heretics should not only be excommunicated, but rightfully put to death, just as it was not an evil act to kill ferocious animals in the jungle. These views of Lepicier had been endorsed by the Vatican with its warm approval. The Roman Church therefore stood committed to the murder of Protestants. That that was so was brought out by a large number of other quotations from eminent Roman authorities, even as late as 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no other known aggregation of men that boast of their desire and intent to tyrannize as do the shameless creatures that make up the Roman Hierarchy. In “The Belief of Catholics” Reverend Father Ronald Knox says: “A body of Catholic patriots, entrusted with the government of a Catholic state, will not shrink from repressive measures in order to secure domination of Catholic principles among their fellow countrymen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an address in Boston Cardinal O’Connell said that “the Catholic church is a power and influence which had better not be overlooked”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A dispatch from Vatican City says that the pope “prays each day in his private chapel for the welfare of American Catholics and nonCatholics”. The latter, it was explained, are “equally the spiritual sons of the “holy father’ ”. If that be so, then why does he wish to kill them </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I </span><span class="font10">And if he does not wish to kill them, why do Catholic theologians insist that when the Catholic church gets strong enough that is just what it intends to do? And if those Catholic theologians are wrong, then why doesn’t the pope himself come out and say so? And if murder is wrong, anyway, why doesn’t the pope come out and denounce that too, while he is about it ? And why does he at the same time finance and back Mussolini?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Read carefully the public proclamation of John Harney, reproduced on page 556, from the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font10"> of 1901. That unmistakable statement of purpose, made officially by a Catholic leader who today is even more prominent and powerful as such in America, no pope of the Roman Hierarchy has yet repudiated as the position he and his cardinal allies insist is theirs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Hierarchy Dirty Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">It is hard for the Roman Hierarchy to do anything except lie, but in these days it is hard even to do that without getting caught at it. “Fides” should mean truthful, faithful, honorable, but does not, when applied to the news-distributing agency quartered at Vatican City. It seems (o be largely devoted to trying to “get” Jehovah’s witnesses. At hand the Malaya </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Leader </span><span class="font10">of Singapore, containing the silliest lies about Judge Rutherford as trying to arouse the Africans against the whites. Then </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font10">published the truth about the Roman Catholic “Watch Tower Movement” in Northern Rhodesia, and “Fides” sent out other dispatches of a widely different tone, now trying to shift the blame to the Watch Tower, but not admitting that it is its own baby, now back and on its own doorstep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Furious because Judge Rutherford told the truth over WCPO about the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Telegraph</span><span class="font10"> shamelessly admitted and even boasted that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“The Catholic Telegraph</span><span class="font10"> ran him off the local radio station a few years ago”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It can be added that no one else would do such dirty work. When it comes to doing despicable, underhanded, un-American work of this class, no one but the Hierarchy can do it as well or would do it at all. Frightened by the Hierarchy the owners of WCPO, Cincinnati, apologized to the Hierarchy, and said they had given instructions Judge Rutherford would hereafter be denied facilities of their station. So be it. God’s arm is not shortened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the same issue in which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Telegraph</span><span class="font10"> boasted of this second piece of dirty work it also made reference to the manager of station W9XBY, of Kansas City, saying threateningly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Evidently he needs a little education, and we have no doubt about the ability of the Jesuits to impart it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New Orleans Sodality, group of female agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, make a comical declaration that they are for peace, but only if Judge Rutherford is shoved off WDSU radio station and kept off; otherwise, and in six days, they threaten to go after all WDSU advertisers. Such a cry for peace is by no means original. In ancient days the wicked Jezebel, as well as her son, made a similar proposal to Jehu, who was zealously bent upon executing his God-given commission. See the record at Second Kings, chapter 9.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The McManuses and Callahans</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In an address at Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Alfred McManus, of Philadelphia, let the cat out of the bag. The Jesuits, in their great hue and cry against an imaginary peril of Communism, have enough sense not to mention Jehovah’s witnesses at all, for they are well aware that the people as a whole know the harmlessness and innocence of the people of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What they aim to do is to inflame the minds of the people against an imaginary Communistic foe so that they may with popular consent seize</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">the country under the pretext of desiring its real welfare. When they get what they want (if they get it), what they will do to Jehovah’s witnesses will be good and plenty (so they think). But their man McManus at Hazleton lacked their shrewdness. He put the two together in his address. They should keep him at home, for he let the cat out of the bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘His Rivirince,’ the ‘Rivirind’ Mr. Callahan, broadcasting for the so-called “Church of the Air”, says that he is sick of the new candor in which “children refuse to do reverence to the flag”, by which he means to take a crack at the children of Jehovah’s witnesses, the only ones involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He fails to mention that, as a result of virtual control of America by Catholic gangsters, the country has become so unsafe for decent people that Lindbergh and his wife felt called upon to leave everything and flee to England. It is the idea of ‘His Rivirince’ that when the Catholic Hierarchy has killed off all the Protestants or chased them out of the country there will be no reason then why any</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;t do not doubt. If they a ere strong enough that the Catholic people would hinder. even by death if necessary. ihc spread of heretical errors among the people, and I say rightly so.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">This was the statement made by the Bev. Mr. Harney, a Paullst Father in 8t. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, in New Brunswick, N. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Friday evening. The Paullst Fathers have been conducting a mission for the. last three weeks In that church. Last week the services were for the benefit of non-Catho-llcs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A feature of last week's services was a ‘•quertion box.&quot; Thia question was road by Father Harney on Friday night.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">•‘Does the Catholic Church regard Prol-estants at heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even with death if necessary!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Harney’s answer was:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">'-In a way. I say yes. Certainly the Church does consider Protestants heretics, in a way. A forma! heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truths of God and the Catholic Church. No man. by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead others into win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I do not doubt, if they were strong .enough, that the Catholic people would hinder, even by death If necessary, the spread of such errors through the people. And 1 say. rightly </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;As human society protects itself against the murderer and the mgn who prows a traitor tb the government, so the Church of God bus the right to protect Itself. The Catholic Church never dreamed of punishing one who is materially a heretic—one who believes things to be true that a^ not true— any more than a tether would punish hi* child- who does wrong unintentionally. The history of the church has been a history of toleration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, &quot;Tbe Catholics have proved more tolerant than the Protestants.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In an Interview last night. Father Haniey stated that his remarks on Friday evening, as above quoted, were correct. He said they expressed his personal convictions and 'were In accord with those of tbe Catholic Church</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Contempt for the Bible</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">On Pope’s Day, Madras, India, February 6, the Very Reverend Father S. R. Santos, referring to the doctrine of papal infallibility as a beacon to light the path, said that man’s guide was “certainly not the Bible”. Wonder if he ever noticed Jesus’ statement, “Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth,” or the apostle’s statement that the Holy Scriptures are able to “make thee wise unto salvation”, and “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path”, and a hundred other texts of like import. But, since these texts are all from the Word of God, for which, as the Very Reverend Santos implies, all Catholic priests have only utmost contempt, why should he bother his head about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An INS cablegram from Vatican City represents the pope as saying to the 2,000 Roman Catholic nurses that they should “pray to the good Lord that he may second the activity and industry of clairvoyant men who understand the exigencies of the real happiness of peoples and social justice”. That the Roman Hierarchy is under the guidance of demons is true not only from the above statement of the pope, but also by his words which follow: “For those men are doing their utmost, not by use of threats, and cannot make the situation worse by irritating the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">spirits</span><span class="font10"> who render this situation more difficult and threatening daily.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not being sure as to the year in which Christ died, the pope made both 1933 and 1934 “holy years”, and at the close of the second one, Joseph Sehrembs, bishop of Cleveland, issued a prayer for success of the bread show at Cleveland, referring, in 1934, to “these days of universal distress and affliction”—thus showing what the two “holy years” accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Hierarchy is all twisted on the “Christmas” business, as on everything else. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Everymans Almanac</span><span class="font10"> (put out by the Santa Fe Railroad System), page 27, in a footnote under the month December, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christmas to celebrate the birth of Christ was first made a legal holiday in the Roman Empire in 534. Though the exact date of Christ’s birth is uncertain, December 25 was probably selected because it already was a festival in honor of the Sun God, Mithra, which seemed an appropriate association for the Christians’ “Prince of Light”. Customs for celebration vary in different lands, some of them even having been adopted from pre-Christian times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Says Emily Kardelic, of Illinois:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I just have to tell you about a remarkable experience in a funeral chapel, where, on January 19, 1936, two bodies lay, one of a deceased sister in the truth, the other a deceased elderly woman who had attended the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses some years back, and had no sympathy with church systems. Her dying wish was to have Jehovah’s witnesses take care of her funeral, but somehow her daughter and friends were not satisfied and called a Catholic priest to deliver a sermon in the chapel, to which he agreed. Everything went off splendidly; the priest was in a front scat listening to Judge Rutherford’s lecture, “Where Are the Dead ? ’ ’ After the lecture was over the priest got up very angry and strode toward the rear. Suspecting what was up, I followed him and heard him say to the daughter, ‘ ‘ Now how can I get up there and talk when Judge Rutherford said the dead are dead and know not anything. What can I say </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">V ’ ’</span><span class="font9"> The daughter tried to encourage him to go ahead and speak his piece anyway, but he strode on out, leaving her in the lurch. It was a splendid witness for the truth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>The Hierarchy an Italian Racket</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The previous make-up of the cardinalate of the Roman church was twenty-four Italians and twenty-five non-Italians. The new make-up is thirty-seven Italians and thirty-one non-Italians. Peter was not an Italian; he was a Jew. In the new batch of cardinals, fourteen out of eighteen were Italians. One of the fourteen was the assistant in charge of Jesuit work in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font10"> saints are quoted at $44,000 up. The more money that can be scooped in, the better, but the least that a real Roman Catholic “saint” can be made for is $44,000. This is just that much more than it cost in Bible times, as anyone can see by reading Romans 16:15, 2 Corinthians 1:1, Ephesians 1:1, and a dozen other similar texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If Dutch Schultz gave up enough to the Hierarchy racketeers he will be made a “saint” some day, and steps in that direction have already been taken, including his glorification in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary Digest.</span><span class="font10"> Murderer of nobody knows how many of even his own friends, a villain that not oven his fellow racketeers could trust, untrue to the women he called “wives”, with a racketeer income of about $150,000 per week, every dollar of which was made in crime, Dutch Schultz, when mortally wounded, became a Roman Catholic, was buried in “consecrated ground” (which is a joke, because all ground belongs to God himself), and the man who sprinkled him says that when he had done so “sanctifying grace, a higher life, the life of God himself throbbed in his soul”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What presumption! What blasphemy! What foolishness! As one gangster said of his deceased comrade, “If a guy like that can get into heaven, there won’t be anybody in hell.” That is merely another way of saying that the heaven of the clergy will be hell for everybody, including the clergy themselves. What a farce!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a 2,000-word encyclical the pope said of an ordinary Roman Catholic priest that 'die is a mediator between God and man. He must be another Christ [an antichrist]”. It is not necessary to say more; that says it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pope wants Americans “converted”. A leaflet issued by the Paulist League sets forth the following benefits which accrue to members: “A plenary indulgence (1) on the day of enrollment; (2) on various feast days; (3) once a month, if they assist at mass in honor of the holy spirit and pray for the conversion of America to the Catholic faith; (4) at the hour of death.” In addition, various and sundry indulgences.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Purveyors of Idolatry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A note from R. E. Browning, of Quebec, enclosed a picture, taken from a Montreal paper, showing poor human creatures on their knees kissing a bishop’s episcopal ring. His landlady, a French Catholic, saw this picture. She had been reading Mr. Browning’s French Bible. Of her own self this lady saw the point when she read Revelation 22: 8, 9: “And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">: for</span><span class="font10"> I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.” Commenting on this Mr. Browning said: “When the lady read the ninth verse she got as deep a thrust from that two-edged sword as I ever saw: in fact, it was suicidal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A statue of Mary in the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain, wears a mantle upon which are embroidered 78,000 pearls. The statue is also adorned with many other jewels, such as diamonds, rubies and emeralds. Mary was poor and married a poor man. As everybody knows, when her Firstborn came into the world He first saw the light of day in a stable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At hand a “fine lot” of advertising literature from “Father” Stedman, The Confraternity of the Precious Blood, 5300 Fort Hamilton Parkway, Brooklyn, New York. Notice that he says of the particular “miraculous medal” sent along with the other material that “Mary Immaculate herself” “designed this medal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is interesting because the last “miraculous medal” received by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> was of a different design. This new one, sent by “Father” Stedman, has quite a few improvements, consisting of eight arcs nicely arranged with the curves toward the center. Whichever one of these medals Mary designed, the other fellows should let it alone, and not horn in with something different, pretending that Mary designed it, when she didn’t design it at all. It confuses purchasers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Inventors of Evil Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following are the dates of various Roman Hierarchy inventions: A.D. 300, prayers for the dead; A.D. 539, the “mass”; A.D. 600, “Purgatory,” worship of Mary and the “saints”; A.D. 788, worship of cross, images and relics; A.D. 965, baptism of bells; A.D. 998, imposition of “Lent”; A.D. 1000, “holy water”; A.D. 1079, celibacy of the priesthood; A.D. 1090, worship with beads; A.D. 1190, sacrifice of “mass” and sale of indulgences; A.D. 1215, transubstantia-tion and auricular confession; A.D. 1220, adoration of wafer; A.D. 1414, refusal to give communion wine to the people; A.D. 1545, church traditions placed on a par with the Scriptures; A.D. 1546, apocryphal books placed in the Bible; A.D. 1854, Mary declared bom without sin; A.D. 1870, infallibility of pope claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Patrick Hayes, archbishop of New York, has himself mixed with Peter the apostle. In an address at Cleveland he said: “Peter is here in the person of the legate of Peter’s successor. The apostles are here in their successors, their excellencies, the members of the Hierarchy, who shed such splendor by their illustrious presence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As there were but twelve apostles, whereas there were 150 bishops at the Cleveland style show, and as Mr. Hayes was Peter, the other eleven apostles were in the other 149. That makes about one apostle to every 13 bishops. Maybe that is all right, but it just doesn’t seem fair for Mr. Hayes to have one apostle all to himself and each 13 of his fellow bishops have each to get along with part of one. And besides, 13 is an unlucky number!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Simon-pure Hypocrites</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Notice an item in the Cleveland </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font10"> that the Most Reverend Joseph Schrembs brought to the United States and located in that city a bevy of Franciscan nuns, one of whom will be on her knees every second of the year. What sense is there in that? and where in the Scriptures can any justification be found for such a course ? Bishop Schrembs’ paper, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Univcise Bulletin,</span><span class="font10"> is the one that managed to call Judge Rutherford 78 evil names in one issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a letter to all Catholics in the Cincinnati archdiocese, John T. McNicholas, archbishop of Cincinnati, said to the flock whom he was encouraging to exercise their right of suffrage: ‘We must give an example, in word and deed, of a fine spirit of religious toleration.” Too bad he did not think of this two years ago, when his official organ, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Telegraph,</span><span class="font10"> was resorting to such intolerant measures to get Judge Rutherford off the air in the Cincinnati territory. Archbishop McNicholas is a Dominican. In the days of the Inquisition the Dominicans were the inquisitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pope, nearly 80 years of age, is reported as resting after a tiring week-end in which he celebrated the feast of the purification of the virgin Mary. Everybody thought the Roman Catholic Hierarchy believes in “Mary Always Immaculate” and wonders why the pope should celebrate a feast commemorating her purification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">D. Gatto, Maryland, sends information copied from the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> that Mastai Ferreti, otherwise known as Pope Pius IX, was expelled from the Grand Lodge of the Masons, Scottish Rite of the Orient, of Palermo, Italy, March 27, 1874, for perjury in cursing those he had solemnly pledged to love and fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A dispatch from Vatican City says the pope blessed 52 Jesuit priests, many of them Americans. It looks, at this writing, as if they were going to need it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Bait for Suckers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Somebody sent in a picture of the so-called “holy” figure on the tile chimney of John Sterle, of Fairchance, Pennsylvania. At first John got 25c each for letting people see this tile. By no stretch of the imagination can it be called a miracle, but the newspapers whooped it up, the chimney was removed to the local Roman Catholic church, and before the fake blew up the church had netted $1,100. The 4,400 suckers that invested in this fake are now ready with another 25c for the next one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It will set you back only $10 to send a list of 20 living and 20 dead people to the Very Rev-erendFather Bede, O.M.C. Provincial, 812 North Salina St., Syracuse, N. Y. Then when he gets your $10 he will, so he says, bind the 40 names in a scroll and leave it where St. Anthony-on-Hudson can take a look at it whenever he likes. Don’t let the fact that Anthony is stone dead disturb you. Others have paid, and why should you hold back and not give Mr. Bede your $10 ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Advertising matter of the “Purgatorian Society, St. Peter’s Church, Fifth Street and Girard Avenue, Philadelphia, Pa.”, explains that one may have a “perpetual membership” for $10, which may be paid at the low rate of 50c a year, if necessary. When you get your card you are assured that “perpetual members are free from all further obligations and will partake of all the spiritual advantages and benefits of the Purgatorian Society forever, both before and after death”. According to the regulations, “if after the death of a member the certificate of membership is presented, the ‘holy sacrifice of the mass’ (low mass) will be offered specially for the repose of his or her soul.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only objection to this arrangement is that the cards have to be on asbestos, to stand the 1,000 years in “purgatory”. And if the poor soul loses the card he is out of luck. Suppose a fellow sticks out in the bake oven for 1,000 years, and finally lands in glory. He thinks everything is all right now; but not so. He is still a member of the Purgatorian Society “both before and after death”. He may be walking innocently down Main Street of the Happy Place, talking to some friend of the long ago, when up comes a spiritual cop and says, ‘Let me see your card.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He looks around, and behold! the card w’hich was at first safely in his breast pocket, under his left wing, has been fanned out by the feathers of the pope's flabelli, and he is left cardless. The cop leads him to a magistrate with red wings (who was once a cardinal). The magistrate thereupon tells him what a fool he was to part with his $10 in the first place, what a further fool he was to spend 1.000 years in “purgatory”, when Dutch Schultz didn't even stop there overnight, and finally tells him he will have to go to hell after all, and turns him over to an angel with an Irish brogue who takes him to a chute and with a good shove sends him on his way.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Bones and Boneheads</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The bones of Lazarus are being shown in France; not the Lazarus who went to Abraham's bosom, for he has them along with him, but the other Lazarus, who went to hell, the Bible hell, and was awakened out of death. At least a Catholic priest in France says he has them. If you don’t believe it, then you are lacking in “faith”, and just like everybody else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Somebody sent in a sample of the card index of “Holy Family Church”, form 103-C-4334-B; and do they look after their flocks ? Of the husband, wife and all the children they inquire the names, year of birth, baptism, first communion, confirmation, Easter duty, confession, mass, school, catechism, home instruction, working, and envelopes. Then they want a summary for the family of the number of delinquents, non-baptized, first communion, confirmation, Easter duty, missing mass, Catholic schools, public schools, attending catechism, failing to attend, working, and envelopes. That is all on one side of the card. Turning it over, there is a place for the family address, the father’s name, the mother’s maiden name, with inquiries regarding each as to whether they are Catholics, converts, possible converts or Protestants. Then they want to know about their marriage, whether it was mixed, or whether they were married by a Catholic or a minister or a justice of the peace; whether the marriage was “convalidated” (rendered “valid” by a priest), whether “lost”, and impediment (if any) or disposition. That is all for a starter. Then getting down to business, they want to know for the family the number that are in the various Catholic societies, the Sacred Heart, Rosary, St. Vincent de Paul, Holy Face, Holy Name, Jr. Holy Name, Sodality, and Altar Boys, and how many are Non-Parish. Then they want to know what Catholic literature each member takes, the home condition, the nationality, the charity, the number attending the adjoining parish, the number of children under instruction, the number going in protest, and the reason. The points on which information is sought are 40 in number, and constitute an infamous prying into the private affairs of the people for which, in the Scriptures, there is not a shadow of reason or right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font10">EAVEN is the habitation of God and of His creatures that are in full harmony with Him. At Isaiah 66:1 it is written: “The heaven is my throne.” The things of heaven are invisible to human eyes. Is it true that all good persons go to heaven when they die? No, that is not true. Such false doctrine is taught by men, but finds no support in the Bible. David, the king of Israel who was much beloved of the Lord and who was used to picture or foreshadow God’s beloved Son and King Jesus Christ, died before Jesus came to earth. Several hundred years after the death of David the Bible declares, at Acts 2: 34, ‘David is not ascended into heaven.’ Among the other good men mentioned in the Bible are Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Job and others, and when Jesus was on the earth these good men had been dead for many hundred years, and Jesus then said (John 3:13): “No man hath ascended up to heaven.” At the same time Jesus stated that no man could ever be taken to heaven except he be born again. No human creature can ever be in heaven; and before a man can go to heaven he must be wholly devoted to God and to Christ Jesus, die as a man, and be resurrected by the Lord as a spirit. Only spirit creatures inhabit heaven. The Scriptures definitely show that only 144,000 creatures once human will be changed into the likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ and be for ever in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why has God so limited the number? Long centuries ago Jehovah declared His purpose to have a royal or capital organization, and that Christ Jesus is the Head thereof and that the members of it should be 144,000 in addition to Christ Jesus. That organization is called Zion, and is the chief organization which Jehovah has declared He will use for ever. God’s universal organization is symbolized by a good woman, and it is that organization that gives birth to those who will be of the heavenly, royal or reigning family. It is written that all such are born of God’s woman and are all taught of God.— Isaiah 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The selection of those who will be of the heavenly organization began more than 1900 years ago, and the faithful apostles were the first selected by the Lord Jesus. The manner of selection the Scriptures point out is this: The man first learns that Jehovah is the true God, who has made provision through Christ Jesus to save the world and rule it in righteousness to the vindication of God’s name. The man must then fully consecrate himself by agreeing to do God’s will, and, having made that agreement, he must faithfully and fully carry it out. He is called out of the world and called to a place in the heavenly organization. He must follow in the footsteps of Jesus, which means that at all times he delights to do the will of God by faithfully obeying. He must prove his integrity toward God. He cannot do this in a week or a year, but must continue faithful even unto death. For this reason the Lord Jesus declares to such, ‘Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life,’ which means the very highest element of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That faithful 144,000 all die like other men, and God raises them out of death, not as human, but as spirit creatures. Concerning this it is written that “they lived and reigned with Christ”. (Revelation 20:4) They have part in the chief resurrection, and over them death can never again have any power. Concerning these faithful ones it is written, at 1 Corinthians 15: 53, that “this mortal must put on immortality”. Immortality they receive at the resurrection. While these men are in the earth and alive as men they must be faithful servants of God and Christ, and the condition upon which it is possible for them ever to be made immortal and be in heaven is that they must be faithful; and for that reason it is written in the Scriptures that such seek immortality, eternal life. (Romans 2:7) No other creatures will ever receive immortality, that high and exalted condition of life being limited to Jehovah’s capital organization under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan has deceived many people by causing them to believe that all men are immortal and that a man can be wicked all of his time on the earth and by making a confession upon his deathbed he can be taken to heaven. Such is a false and wicked doctrine. You may ask, Did not Jesus say to the thief that he would go to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">heaven the very day he was put to death ? No, that is not what Jesus said. Where did the thief go ? That question will be answered on another occasion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE Albanian king, himself a Moslem, is trying to get the Albanian women to cease covering their faces, and to revel in their ignorance. His sisters, also Moslems, are helping him, often riding through the streets in modern attire. Most of the Albanian women stick to the old customs and dread the new ones.

<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font10">EFERRING to the superpatriots of Massachusetts who have saddled the state with a teachers’ oath bill that is both stupid and silly, President Daniel L. Marsh, of Boston University, called attention to the fact that in 1932 the Communists got only 90,000 votes out of 38,000,000 votes cast, and then said: “If anyone thinks that oaths are not lightly taken and easily broken, let him attend a court trial, or watch some grand jury begin a graft investigation, or listen to certain national, state, county or municipal officials take the oath of office, and then watch how these officials keep their oaths, and he will see a carnival of perjury. The fact is, the observer will discover that men, in order to gather riches to themselves or to keep from being detected in crime, or to shield someone else, or to build up a political machine, will trifle with the most sacred institutions of our whole system of law. They will trample honor and religion underfoot. They will pile perjury upon perjury, until the public is confronted with a malodorous mountain of iniquity.” Dr. Marsh branded both the American Legion and the D.A.R. as “well-intentioned but misguided organizations”. He described the bill as “a bubble escaping to the surface, betraying some rotten condition underneath”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font10"> SPHERE is plenty of disloyalty in this country, but it is not in the classrooms. It is in the countinghouses, the newspaper and magazine offices, and in those places where the plans are made for periodically inflating and deflating money and credit, in the grinding down of labor, in cheating the raw material producer out of a fair price for his products. These are the practices that undermine societies and destroy nations. Our danger is not from radicalism, but from Fascism. Fascism asserts itself more effectively when it can dictate what shall be taught in any public school.”—Sioux City (Iowa) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">CCORDING to statistics of the fifty most important states of the world, 2,400,000 people died of starvation in 1934, and about 1,200,000 people committed suicide as a result of starvation. At the same time, owing to the collapse of prices, 267,000 carloads of wheat, 258,000 tons of sugar, 26,000 tons of rice and 25,000 tons of beef were destroyed. This does not include foodstuffs destroyed by natural causes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font10">OT understanding the powers of the demons, and probably knowing little or nothing about these evil creatures, though the Scriptures have much to say on the subject, Dr. G. B. Kirkland, former British medical officer in Southern Rhodesia, tells of three types of murder by witchcraft which he has observed: the handshake of death, the spell of death, and the stretcher of death. Not only has he known of deaths by each of these methods, but reports having seen numbers of natives walk through a pit of lire so hot he could not get within twelve feet of it. They came out unsinged and stepped from the fire into kettles of boiling water. One was a woman with a baby in her arms; another was a man carrying a garland of flowers. The doctor, now in London, admits he does not understand how these things were done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ajos Pap, Hungarian carpenter, living in Budapest, is a spirit medium, i.e., in touch with and under the control of the fallen angels, demons. At spiritistic seances he has, on occasion, produced as many as thirty-two beetles by snatching at the air. This indicates that the demons well understand the design and structure and production of the lower forms of life. At one seance, many years ago, a spirit medium produced a small fish such as is found in only a small district in the East Indies. The fish dropped from the ceiling of the seance room, alive, wet and flopping, strangling for want of water. If not created on the spot, the fish was transported 12,000 miles in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font10"> of February 17, 1935, has a story nearly half a column long that there are about seventy Dutch Reformed ministers that are without jobs, with more being constantly ground out from the theological seminaries. The fact of the business is that these men who disbelieve the Bible have nothing to offer the people, and their only reasonable way to an honest livelihood is to turn farmer and produce something that will be of some benefit, at least to themselves. The young men who are diverted from the dishonest business of dishonoring God into the respectable business of farming are to be congratulated.</span></p>

A. S. Mackenzie, writing on the subject from Canada, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I enjoyed article about the British Israel subject. Said article should be helpful to any honest one enquiring the way to Zion. One text I would like to mention, as it was a great help to me. The very first verse in the epistle of James. It is addressed to the whole of the twelve tribes scattered abroad—and not lost. Some years ago I had it made clear to me that the idea of tribes being lost was not the Scriptural teaching. The reference is to the tribes that were scattered in the same way that a message could apply written from Scotland to the Scots who are scattered abroad. One can see poor logic in sending a message to anyone who is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">lost,</span><span class="font9"> but the messages of James and Paul did reach the nation of Israel even if scattered abroad, and this passage in the Bible should convince any honest enquirer that there are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">no lost tribes.</span></p>

He said: “It was not the men who won the war, though so many of them nobly gave themselves; it was not money, though many gave until it hurt; not munitions, not the Americans, who came in to help us. It was God and God alone, who gave us the victory.” According to that, the Americans don’t get a single tally anywhere for the billions of Liberty bonds which they so gladly subscribed for when they did not dare refuse to do so, and which shall wholly be paid by American taxpayers only.</span></p>

It had been urged that it would make the district safer for women and children, but this was denied, and the reverse held. There was some difference of opinion, but the resolutions were carried by a large majority.</span></p>

Now, though his mother wanted him to stay in Switzerland and finish his education, the government has ordered him back to Siam, where they can make him the puppet, while they get all the power and the glory. Poor little Ananda is only ten years old and doesn’t know what it is all about. There are others in Siam that are in bad, too; for at the time the order went forth that Ananda must come home the authorities there arrested 4 colonels, 8 majors, 30 captains and 78 other army officers and sent them to prison for conspiracy to cause a national insurrection. Sixteen state officials, fourteen of them from the ministry of the interior, were sent to prison along with their friends in the army.</span></p>

And what when the same shark had been killed and eaten by other Marquesans ? And in the case of the early Christian forefathers, who were eaten by men of other tribes, and afterwards the cannibals were eaten in retaliation, and then the last feaster eaten by the shark ?”</span></p>

The mangosteen is a wholesome fruit, which cannot be transported, not even with the aid of refrigeration or when coated with wax. Five days after leaving the tree the pulp melts away to a brown mass”.</span></p>

For some years now tractors, dredges and other heavy machinery have been carried in by airplane, and now the natives have become so used to the sight of the planes that men that were cannibals in 1927 now travel by airplane as freight at so much a pound.</span></p>

Then she picks another, lassoes him, and so on down the line. After a dozen such alliances, picking off $1,000 here and other alimony there, she is able to retire. About 1,000 such divorces were granted Mohammedan women in 1934.</span></p>

In some instances the insane were housed with the sick; and in one place, where four children were housed, the bathroom was used as a maternity hospital.

One of the policemen was in uniform. The party took Shoemaker thirty miles out of town, stripped him, crushed one side of his head by repeated blows, injured his throat so that he lost the power of speech, mutilated his shoulder and side so they were paralyzed, and then poured hot tar into his bleeding wounds. They then rubbed him in feathers and went off and left him. When human creatures found him and got him to a hospital, gangrene had set in and he died. His crime was that he was a Socialist. This is a fairly good look at Jesuitism, sometimes called Catholic Action, sometimes called Fascism, and sometimes called Hitlerism, as it appears at close quarters. How do you like the looks of it? The policemen who committed the murder have been arrested and will probably be reproved. In beating Shoemaker and two others the police rolled each naked man on a log, with a man holding each arm and each leg while they were beaten with chains and rawhide whips that cut to the bone.</span></p>

The assembly was quiet, law-abiding, and without ostentation. The names and addresses of the seventy-five men and women participating were duly filed beforehand at the office of your police chief. Nothing was done in secret. However, one of youi' city’s law-enforcement officers endeavored to stop the work, and cited seven of the witnesses to appear in the chief’s office. He himself did not appear there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this interview there was manifested the most decided spirit of viciousness. Two Legionnaires were called in, one of these making threats of mob violence toward innocent and law-abiding people. It is our firm conviction that your police chief was guilty of malfeasance in office and could be impeached, for he countenanced such methods by his every action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If we commit acts against the laws of the city of Lindsay we demand to be tried by the courts of Lindsay, and not before the mobs of selfconstituted authority. If the flag which these “super patriots” claim to reverence so much guarantees anything at al], it surely guarantees protection against vicious mobsters aided and abetted by your police chief.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Disobedience Brings Disappointment and Death</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE outstanding reason why Jehovah God selected Moses as the typical deliverer of His typical people was that “the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth”. (Numbers 12:3) That is to say, he was teachable, willing to be led.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A greater than Moses, inviting all the weary and heavy laden to come to Him and find rest for their souls, offered as a major inducement the fact that He is “meek and lowly in heart”. (Matthew 11:29) Jesus came to “preach good tidings unto the meek” (Isaiah 61:1), and the effect of His teachings will ultimately be “to save all the meek of the earth”. (Psalm 76:9) “The meek shall eat and be satisfied.” (Psalm 22:26) “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his w<sup>T</sup>ay.” (Psalm 25:9) “The meek shall inherit the earth.” (Psalm 37:11) “[Jehovah] lifteth up the meek.” (Psalm 147: 6) “He will beautify the meek with salvation.”—Psalm 149: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul the apostle was meek. That is why he ■was able to say from his heart, “When I am weak, then am I strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:10) His confidence was not in himself; it was wholly in the Lord. That is why he was able to say, “I can do all things through Christ which strength-eneth me” (Philippians 4:13), and in quiet confidence could be “persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day”.—2 Timothy 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because Moses was so meek, inclining away from himself and inclining toward God, it was necessary for Jehovah to lift him out of his timidity by a series of miracles, the rod turned into a serpent and then back into a rod, and the hand made leprous and then restored, before Moses could comprehend that God could really use him to do His work, when, from Moses’ viewpoint, someone else would be more suitable.— Exodus 4:1-8.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>Moses’ Brother Was Less Meek</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Inasmuch as Moses was meek “above all the men which were upon the face of the earth”, it follows, as a matter of course, that Aaron was less so, and the same could be said of his sister Miriam. Yet both of these were much used by the Lord, and were doubtless meek themselves above most of their fellow Israelites. Of the same parentage as Moses, they probably had some family traits, all inclining towards God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the miracles were performed in Moses’ presence, and upon his very person, he protested that he was not eloquent, and sought that some other might have the privilege of service for which, without his knowledge, he had been prepared by the hand of God. Jehovah therefore told him that He had sent his brother Aaron out into the wilderness to meet him, and to act as his spokesman before Pharaoh, which he did, with results known to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was Aaron that introduced Moses to the elders of Israel upon his arrival in Egypt. “And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: and Aaron spake all the words which [Jehovah] had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.” (Exodus 4: 29, 30) The arrangement seems to have been that Jehovah made known His will to Moses, and Aaron did the talking and performed the acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the time came for Moses and Aaron to appear before Pharaoh, Jehovah made confirmation of the message in the wilderness that Aaron should be the actor and spokesman. “And [Jehovah] said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet [spokesman]. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh.”—Exodus 7:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the instructions given to Moses follow : “Thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.” (Exodus 7:9) “Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters.” (Exodus 7:19) This was done when the waters were turned into blood, and done again, and the same language used (Exodus 8:5), when the frogs invaded the land. “Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice.” (Exodus 8:16) Manifestly, all the plagues were performed in the same manner. Aaron received his instructions from Moses, and himself was the actor and spokesman, by the request of Moses and the consent of Jehovah God. He was thus made very prominent before Pharaoh and before Israel.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>At the Giving of the Law</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">At the giving of the law at Mount Sinai, it was Moses only that was permitted to ascend into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">presence of God. Aaron, with his sons, and seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to go part way, and to behold the glory of God from afar. (Exodus 24:1) Only Moses was to come near; the others were not to do so.—Exodus 24:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the forty days while Moses was in the mountain (Joshua being at a distance, along with the others, but nearer to him) he seemed to the people to have been destroyed in the great fire which made the mountain smoke like a volcano, and Aaron, at their request, made the golden calf. The people, when they saw the calf, said, “These be thy gods, O Israel, that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.” Aaron knew that was wrong, and so he made a proclamation that the next day should be a feast to Jehovah. —Exodus 32:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Subsequently reviewing the matter Moses said: “And [Jehovah] was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.” (Deuteronomy 9: 20) But for the intercession of Moses Aaron would have perished along with the others on the day that Moses came down from the mount, “for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies.”—Exodus 32: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because he had married an Ethiopian woman. “And they said [truthfully, too, but not meekly], Hath [Jehovah] indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And [Jehovah] heard it.” (Numbers 12:2) As a result, Miriam, who was probably the chief offender, was smitten with leprosy. But Jehovah rebuked Aaron also, and Aaron repented and pleaded with Moses to intercede for their forgiveness. Miriam was healed, but shut out of the camp for seven days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a lesson here, for the consideration of those that are so quick to busy themselves with the private affairs of others, and to even lift their tongues against those Jehovah is manifestly using as His own servants. Before the Lord smote Miriam with leprosy white as snow He asked the significant question: “Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against ray servant Moses Numbers 12: 8.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>Korah, Dathan and Abiram</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">At the conspiracy of Korah, Dathan and Abiram and 250 of the elders of Israel, Aaron was himself the object of denunciation, and the conspirators used almost the same words against him and against Moses as he and Miriam had used against Moses. They said to Moses and Aaron, “Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and [Jehovah] is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of [Jehovah] ?”—Numbers 16: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah showed then, and always shows, that He is faithful to those that are faithful to Him. What Moses and Aaron had just caused to be done (putting ribbons of blue on the borders of the garments) was done by command of Jehovah. The object, stated by Jehovah himself, was “that ye seek not after your own heart, and your own eyes”. (Numbers 15:39) The people were to learn to walk with God, to seek His will in every affair of life, and to be wholly (holy) for Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and their wives and children, and tents, and all that they had, went down alive into an earthquake rent in the bosom of the earth, and the earth closed upon them. And fire came out from before Jehovah and burned up the 250 men that had backed them up in their madness. At that time Jehovah showed that He was using the house of Aaron to do a specific work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When twelve rods, one for each tribe, were laid up before Jehovah, the rod of Aaron, representing the tribe of Levi, budded and blossomed and yielded almonds in a single night. Jehovah thus drove home the lesson that He uses whom He will. None may question His wisdom or His almighty power. Thereafter the Lord’s selection of the house of Aaron to perform the work of the priesthood for fleshly Israel was never questioned by them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>The Disobedience at Meribah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The disobedience at Meribah is best told in the language of the Scriptures themselves:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin, in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before [Jehovah]! And why have ye brought up the congregation of [Jehovah] into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there ? And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of [Jehovah] appeared unto them. And [Jehovah] spake unto Moses, saying, Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And Moses took the rod from before [Jehovah], as he commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock; and he [Aaron, the spokesman, as usual, no doubt] said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and w’ith his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly: and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And [Jehovah] spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. This is the water of Meribah [strife]; because the children of Israel strove with [Jehovah], and he was sanctified in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And [Jehovah] spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor; and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And Moses did as [Jehovah] commanded: and they went up into mount- Hor, in the sight of all the congregation. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount.”—Numbers 20:1-13, 23-28.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>No Excuses Offered for Aaron</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">No excuses are offered for Aaron’s disobedience, and no apparent reason exists why any should be made. He was 123 years of age, and for forty years had not only witnessed but been an important personal factor in scores of scenes which can only properly be styled “acts of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a land without radio, telegraph, telephone or postal service he had been sent out to meet Moses and guided unerringly to the exact spot where he met his brother he had not seen in forty years. Together they had performed great signs and miracles in the presence of their brethren and of Pharaoh and had brought two million slaves out of Egypt, through the Red sea, and seen the waters close upon their enemies, at the hands of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He had seen God feed His people in a barren land, and sweeten bitter waters so that they might go onward in their journey. When they had lusted for flesh food he had seen that want supplied. He had witnessed the smiting of Amalek, and knew that the smiting was wholly due to God’s power, for when Moses’ hands were weary the battle was against Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He could remember when the whole mountain of Sinai smoked and trembled at the presence of Jehovah. He knew that in the ark was the law of his God, a perfect embodiment of wisdom and justice and love. In the same ark was his rod, which bore such eloquent testimony to God’s purpose to use him and his family after him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He had had the honor for forty years of being God’s typical high priest, and every year had witnessed hundreds of miracles in that office. Once, on the installation of the priesthood, he had seen the fires of heaven descend and lick up the sacrifice upon the brazen altar in the court of the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And, finally, he had been a participant in all the experiences narrated in this brief history of his life. When Jehovah God had given him his instructions at Meribah they should have been obeyed instantly and with meticulous care to obey both the letter and the spirit of the instructions. But instead of obeying God, and thus helping the people to see that Jehovah is the source of all their blessings, he had injected his own personality into it and impudently asked, “Must ue fetch you water out of this rock?”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>The More Guilty of the Two</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Moses shared in Aaron's sentence, which was that neither one of them should bring the congregation into Canaan, but Aaron was evidently the one most blameworthy. His death occurred almost at once, and he did not see the promised land at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Moses was privileged to see it, but not to go into it; and thus there is revealed something of the tenderness of the great and good and merciful God, who, while not withholding the penalty pronounced, is yet able to soften the blow and heal the wounded spirit by varying the method by which the penalty is carried into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is easy to see how the sin of the two men occurred. The Israelites were hard to handle, and are hard to handle to this very day. They were rebellious and thankless and forgetful, and interested only in self, and not at all in the name of the true and living God, who had given them life in the first place and was now leading them on toward liberty. And Moses and Aaron were themselves weary with the accumulation of years and the great burden of responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the best excuse is no excuse at all. They should not have done what they did; they knew better than to do it; and there was no need of doing it. Obedience would have brought the water and the favor of God besides, and that is everything. If one has that he has all; and if he does not have it he has nothing. The two men exalted themselves and dishonored God. Aaron is not mentioned in Hebrews, eleventh chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The account says that among all these rebellious Israelites God was sanctified. That means that He demonstrated among them that He is Jehovah, the true and living God. He did this in spite of the act of Moses and Aaron. He did it, first, by giving water to the thirsty two millions of people and their animals, and, secondly, by forbidding that those who had disobeyed and dishonored Him should enter into the promised land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘'But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of [Jehovah] thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.’’—Deuteronomy 28:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">URING the month of April, when the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font10"> book was released for the first time, more than 25,000 people in the United States alone were so interested and so thoroughly convinced that this book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font10"> written by Judge Rutherford, should be placed in the hands of the people that they made every effort possible to spend some time calling upon their neighbors and those in their vicinity with this publication. Were you one of these 25,000, or would you like to be one of the many who will again put forth an extraordinary effort in June to distribute this most heart-cheering message? The people of good will in the earth desire true riches. You can see to it and make it possible for these people to obtain true RICHES by availing yourself of the offer set out in the coupon below. We feel sure that almost every </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> reader has read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font10"> book, and enjoyed its contents, and these many thousands have found and proved to themselves the proverb, “Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.” The blessing they received they passed on to others; and if we could only relate here the many experiences enjoyed which have been reported to the office, you too would soon want to have a share in the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom. Why not begin now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a special 9-day period known as the “Zeal of His House”, June 6-14, during which time the book RICHES and the booklet CHOOSING and two other booklets will be offered, on a contribution of 35c. Will you join Jehovah’s witnesses in a mighty proclamation? Send your order in now and be a publisher during June.</span></p>

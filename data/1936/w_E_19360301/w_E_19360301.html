<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>LOYALTY AND FAITHFULNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“J/y </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother; bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.”—Prov. 6:20,21,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH requires absolute loyalty and faithfulness of every one whom he makes a member of his royal organization. The same rule appears to apply to all who receive life everlasting. Jehovah is the Father, or Life-giver, and there is no life everlasting received save that which proceeds from him. He dispenses the great gift of life by and through Christ Jesus, his executive officer. (Korn. 6:23) The mother of the members of the royal house is Jehovah God’s organization, symbolized by his woman, otherwise called Zion. All who arc born of her receive life from and are taught by Jehovah God. (Isa. 54:13) In brief, the meaning of Proverbs 6:20 is this: That the sons of God must keep his commandments and be guided by the law of his organization, for “the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> While the English word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">loyalty</span><span class="font5"> does not appear in the Scriptures, yet there are many words in the Bible that have exactly the same meaning as loyalty. The Scriptures clearly teach that every man who receives life everlasting must prove himself both loyal and faithful. There is a distinction between loyally and faithfulness. Technically, one might be loyal and not be faithful. No one is chosen as a member of the royal house unless that one proves to be both loyal and faithful. Always loyal and faithful, it is written of Jesus Christ that he is The “Faithful and True”. He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. (Kev. 19:11; 17:14) Thus it is seen that each one of the body membei's of Christ must be an image of the Head, Christ Jesus.—-Eoin. 8:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The correct definition of the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">loyalty</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faithfulness</span><span class="font5"> are found in the Scriptures. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">loyal</span><span class="font5"> is from the same root as the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">law. Law</span><span class="font5"> means a rule of action or conduct prescribed and made binding by the supreme governing authority, commanding what is right, and naming a penalty for the infraction of that fixed rule or law. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lawful</span><span class="font5"> means that which is pennit ted by and done in conformity to law. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Loyal </span><span class="font5">means that which is done in strict conformity with the law; that which is done in accordance with the law of God. A loyal creature is one who proceeds according to God’s law. Loyaltj’ to God therefore means to carefully and strictly be obedient to his law. His will is his law whether expressed or unexpressed, and that will is expressed by him in his Word for the correct guidance of the man who desires to be right. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) There is no other correct guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">* Faithfulness</span><span class="font5"> means more than merely to obey the letter of the law. A faithful one is trusty, trustworthy, established, steady, firm, secure, true and certain. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Faithful</span><span class="font5"> means fidelity in the adherence to right as directed by the Lord. It means watchfulness and carefulness in the observance and performance of a duty or the discharge of an obligation. To be faithful means to be honest, constant and unchangeable. It means integrity. To maintain one’s integrity toward God he must be faithful. That means he must be true and constant in his allegiance and devotion to God, because he is bound to God and Christ by a solemn covenant. It means tiiat the man in the covenant with God must be thorough and firm in the observance and performance of service entrusted to him. It means to be true, reliable, worthy of dependance and entirely dependable. Only the righteous who maintain and preserve their integrity toward God enter into his royal house. “Open ye the gates, that there may enter in a righteous nation preserving fidelity.” (Isa. 2G: 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">h’oth.) </span><span class="font5">In the examination of the texts that follow the distinction between loyalty and faithfulness may be seen, and also that God requires his sons to be both loyal and faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LOYAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The law of Jehovah, that is, the rule of action or conduct prescribed by him for man, is perfect, and he who walks truly and sincerely in the law of God goes in the right way, and, continuing therein, that man will receive the everlasting favor of God. (Ps. 19: 7-9) Of Jesus these words are recorded: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law<sup>7</sup> is within my heart.” (Ps. 40:8) That means that at all times Jesus is cn-tiiely devoted to Jehovah God’s rule prescribed for the righteous, that such at all times was the rule of his heart, and that at all times he delights to do the will of God. A similar rule applies to all men who are blessed of God; as it is written: ‘‘Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor silteth in the seat of the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.'’ (I’.s. 1:1.2) To meditate on the law of God day and night means to consider it all the time, that is, the man always con.Jders the will or law of God and is diligent to be guided by that law. He is constantly examining his course of conduct in the light of God's law. The “heart” means both the seat of motive and devotion, and must be always in harmony with God’s law. “The mouth of the righteous sp; aketh wisdom, and his tongue tallicth of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slide.”—Ps. 37:30,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>r</sup>’A person may outwardly observe the law of God, that is to say, perform v.hat i, often called the litter of the law, and others obsirving his course would say: “That is a lawful man.” But it is for the Lord to judge. He judges fiom a different viewpoint from that of man, because God looks at the motive that eaires the man to act. “The Lord seeth not as man sceth; for man lool.etii on the outward appearance, but the Lord Icoketh (&gt;n the heart.” (1 Sam. ](&gt;: 7) It is quite easy to deceive nun, but no one can deceive the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ L’nlcsS one delights* in doing the will of God he cannot live. “Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; for thy law is my delight. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed. 1 have longed for thy salvation, () Lord; and thy law is my delight.” (Ps. 119:77,80,171) The moving eair-e for obedience to the law </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> God must be love, that is, a ready response to the requirements of Ihe law without reference to what may be personally gained in this life. The right motive must be a sincere desire to serve God because he is right, righteous and just. For this reason God’s commandment i.s of the greatest importance, which says to man: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (Matt. 22: 37) The creature who is pleasing to God cannot divide his affection or devotion between God and any creature or any image or thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The law of God is bis rule of action or conduct prescribed for all men. The commandment of the Lord is a positive and emphatic expression of his will or law' concerning one that is in a covenant with Ged, the commandment directing the creature in the light way to go, and what he mint do. Every commandment of the Lord is a part of his law. Commandments not only prescribe the correct course of man or conduct, but make it imperative that those to whom the commandments are addressed follow such course of conduct. The Israelites were (tod’s covenant people, having voluntarily agreed to do his will. They were, as a nation, forerunners of tho.,e who have started to follow in the foot-heps of Je&gt;u; Christ that they might be a part of God's holy nation. The true Israelites are those who have entered into a covenant with Jehovah, trusting in the merit of Christ Jesus’ blood, and who arc specifically and emphatically bound to obey his law and his commandments For that reason God gave tins commandment to all of his covenant people, to wit : “Thou fhalt have no other gods before | besides </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(IluUtcrfiaiii)</span><span class="font5"> ] me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image<sup>1</sup>, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under Ihe earth: thou .‘halt not bow down thyself to them.”—Ex. 20:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>,J</sup> Every creature must choose either to remain with and serve the Devil if he so desires or to serve God, but whin one voluntarily agrees to do the will of God he enters into a covenant with God and therefore ir<sup>1 </sup>take, the name of Jehovah God. If he divides his devotion and service between God and the Devil or any of the Devil’s agents or representatives or image-, he takes the name of God in vain. That means he takes God’s naan<sup>1</sup> without any good resulting, but, on the contrary, there results to such a creature dhastir. That man </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ik</span><span class="font5"> comes an idolater, and must miller complete loss.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The emphatic commandment of the Lord at Exodus 20:3 is given for the benefit of the creature, because the endure who las agreed to do God's wdl must keep and perform his covenant or ngieenunt ami this he can do only by having no god besides Ji liovali. For this reason one in a covenant with Dod cannot pursue a course of conduct contrary’ to God's law. The saluting of a flag of an earthly government or the hailing of a man who u the visible ruler of such government i&lt; attributing salvation to what the fl.ig or the man hailed stands for or represents. Theie is no salvation or life for man save that which God has provided through Christ Jesus. The one who has entered into a covemu t with God has fully' agreed to that great truth. (Acts 4:12) For that creature to attnbule salvation to any’ man-made thing, rule or image, such as that which is represented by a flag of a nation or the man or men that control the nation, is a direct violation of the commandment of God and means that the man so doing is taking the name of God in vain, and if he persists in such a course he must suffer destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> To some persons the saluting of a flag of a nation or hailing a man who is the iuler of the ‘government means little or nothing, because they have no understanding of God’s commandment and have not enteic’d into a covenant with God to do his will. .Many pei-ons get in line with such ceiemony of saluting be -aiise they fear the power of men, and many’ salute because others do so, and many are unable to give any reason for so doing. It is entirely different concerning those persens who have entered into a covenant to do the will of God. There is no excuse for their not knowing. Some person who has covenanted to do God's will may salute Hags and hail men in order to avoid adverse ciiticism or persecution, and he may do such saluting with a mental reservation that he does not regard the flag or the man as of any real importance. Thereby such a person deceives men, but he doos not deceive God, who looks at the heart or motive. A person in a covenant, so acting, is a hypocrite and is an abomination in God's sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The covenant people of God have no right to tell otlicrs who are not in the covenant with the Lord to di cline to salute Hags or hail men or to salute and had mtn. Each one must choose for himself. The follower of Christ Jesus is directed to be quiet and attend to his own business. (1 The<sup>:</sup>s. 4:11) It is no part of his business to tell others what they may do or not do. With God's covenant jieople, however, each one must look well to his own course of action, that it is in harmony with the will of God. The covenant people of Jehovah God can be loyal to him only by strictly walking according to the divinely fixed rules. The Lord caused a recoid Io be made in his Word concerning time faithfid Hebrews who iefused to bow down to the image of the Devil’s oiganization, and without doubt this was done lor the very purpose of emphasizing the n&lt; cessity of strict obedience Io God’s Jaw or commandment. (Daniel 3) The covenant people of God properly obey every law of the land winch is m harmony wdh God’s law, but when there is a direct conflict between the law of man and the law of God the covenant people of God must obey God’s law regardless of what men may say or do.—Acts 4: 19; 5: 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FALLACY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> One in a covenant with Jehovah may attempt to reason himself into a position whore he can justify hi i conduct. He permits liis selfish motive to direct him in the wrong course. Ho builds up an argument to support his course, which argument is fallacious. 'That this point may be emphasized, note again the words of the first text herein: “Keep [obey] thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother.” The selfish man says, in substance: “I have reasoned this matter out for myself, and my understanding is that 1 can outwardly obey every Jaw of man, even such laws as are in direct conflict with God’s law, and 1 think it best to proceed along the course of least resistance, that I may dwell in peace with all fellow creatures; therefore I will get in line with whatever is the. rule of conduct in my community.” A person thus reasoning is not exercising the spirit of a sound mind. The covenant people of God must keep in mind that human reasoning and conclusions are often very fallacious. There is but one sure and -afc guide, and that is the Word of God, and therefore the Lord says to his covenant people: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3:5,6) The follower of Christ Jesus must measure his course of action or conduct by the law of God, and that alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> “The law of thy mother” is the proper course of conduct to be pursued by those who are of God’s organization. Great is the favor to man to be brought into and form a part of the organization of the Lord. No person will long be permitted to remain in that organization, however, who willingly violates organization instructions. To violate the instructions coming from God’s organization means to “forsake . . . the law of thy mother”. Jehovah has a capital organization, of which Christ Jesus is the head, and that organization, being the highest part or “hill” of his holy mountain, is also called Zion. Concerning the rule of action by which God's people must be guided Jehovah says: “Out of Zion shall go forth the law.” (Isa. 2:2-4) We are now in the “last da.vs”, and the house of the Lord i.s established above the kingdoms of this world. The Loid is in his holy temple and commands that all the earth keep silence before him. it is the time when many pioplc, that i.s, the great multitude, are coming and saying: ‘Let us go up to the kingdom of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that we may walk in the right way.’ Thereby they attach themselves to God’s organization. On the earth the Lord has an organization, and his servants in that organization the Lord teaches, directs, guides and instincts. The law or rule for man, and for the conduct of that organization, the Lord Jesus sends forth as the executor of Jehovah. The obligation is upon every one of the organization to be strictly attentive to and joyfully obedient to the instructions that the Loid sends forth from Zion. Christ Jesus, the head of that organization, is Jehovah’s great Prophet, and all who are in the covenant with God must give heed to and fully obey that great Prophet, and he who fails or refuses to obey suffers destruction. (Acts 3:23) In that organization God lias placed every man as it pleaseth him. No man can take that honor to himseli. (1 Cor. 12:18; lleb. 5:4) Eaclr one in the organization of the Lord must stand or fall 1o his Master. (Rom. 14:4; Eph. 6:9) A man whom the Lord has favored by giving him a place in his organization, and which place is subordinate to some other' place assigned to some other person in that organization, reasons that he is wiser than the other, possesses greater ability than otlicrs and that therefore ire will ignore organization instructions and pursue his own course. Instructions come to hirn through the regular course in the organization which he not only ignores but for which he substitutes his own ideas in performing duties to the organization. He regards organization instructions as of no consequence so far as Jie is concerned, and speaks with contempt concerning those wlio convey the instructions to him. lie murmurs and complains of what he is requested to do, is haughty, austere, highminded, and follows his own selfish course. Thereby he is guilty </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">forsaking the ‘law of his mother’, that is, of God’s organization. When his attention is called to the fact </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">he is disregarding organization instructions, such reproof angers him and he applies words of abuse to those who call his attention to his derelictions or shortcomings. The Lord has his own good way of rebuking those who stray from the path of strict obedience to his law or organization instructions. If one takes the improper course and is reproved, such reproof is for his good if properly received, as it is written: “For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.’’ (L’rov. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">C: </span><span class="font5">23) The converse of this statement of the scripture must be true. One in the covenant with God who disregards the commandment of Jehovah and the instructions of his organization is not in the way of life.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> If a man fears God he will think soberly and take the wise course, because “the. fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom’’. (Ps. 111:10) “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil,’’ that is, to hate and refrain from anything that would do injury to God’s organization or those who are diligent in performing sen ice in that organization, (l’rov. 8:13) Obedience to the law of God and to his organization is the only way that leads to life; as it is written: “The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from 1he snares of death.’’ (Prov. 13:14) To scorn, hate or willfully violate organization instructions, that is, the law of God’s organization, is a foolish course for one to take. One reaches the point where he must decide quickly whether be will heed the reproof received and turn to the right, or whether he will take his own selfish course and disregard the reproof that comes to him. One course leads to death, the other to life and the blessing of the Lord. Concerning this it is written: “How long, ye simple ones, will yc love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my w’ords unto you. But yc have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of mj' reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity; I w<sup>r</sup>ill mock when your fear cometh.’’--Prov. 1: 22, 23, 25, 2G.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> It is rank fallacy for a man to build up an argument to justify his own conduct and to willingly disregard reproof that comes to him for violating organization instructions. It may please God to put one man in his organization whose duty is to give instructions and who has less natural abilitv than many others, but that is no excuse or justification for others to disregard the instructions that proceed from the Lord’s organization. Each one has the choice of being obedient to organization inst’ uctions or of calmly and quietly withdrawing from the organization. If he would please the Lord he will do with his might wnat his hands find to do, trusting in the Lord to cause all things to work together for his good.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEEDING HIS OWN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The teachers of God’s covenant people, and who therefore feed them upon spiritual food eonvenunt for them, are not men. This is particularly true since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. God and Christ Jesus are the teachers. (Isa. 30: 20) The Lord Jesus at the temple is the dispenser of food for his own. He, must employ some human means to convey the spiritual food to the mind of creatures who have a human organism, lie would not employ divers means and numerous channels through which to operate his organization and transmit his spiritual food. The Lord has proved to his people, particularly within the last few years, that he is feeding his people the truth through the 'Watch Tower publications. No human ingenuity or ability could set forth the meaning of the prophecies which God's people have received within the past few years. Prophecy is not of private interpretation, and he who attempts to place a private interpretation upon prophecy shows himself to be a tool, for the reason that by his course of conduct he says in bis heart, There is no God, that is, God and Christ are not directing the covenant people. (2 Pet. 2.20; Ps. 14:1) The Lord himself leads his people and feeds them, and this includes the remnant as well as the “great multitude’’.—Kev. 7:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> If a man lias received the favor of the Lord Ly being assigned to some place in his organization on the earth, and then disregards the spirit mil food which the Lord has caused to be published for the benefit of his people, and that man substitutes his own teaching and interpretation, he is thereby without doubt ‘lor-saking the law of his mother’. When his wrongful course is thus called to the attention of such a man, that of itself constitutes a reproof from the Lord ami affords that man the opportunity to turn to the right. That it is the duty of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to call att• n-tion to these things appears to be certain fiom Hie Lord’s Word. When one sees that ho, has departed from ‘the law of his mother’, and thus receives reproof from the Lord, it is his privilege to give beul </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">that reproof and quickly face about. Can he receive the blessings of everlasting life if he fails and refuses to do so? The answer is found in the scripture which says: “For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof; therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.’’ (Prov. 1:29-32) If he do&lt;s hud the reproof and turn to the right, the Lord say.s to him: “But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell sc I'c-ly, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.”— Prov. 1 : 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> If one favored with being made a member of God’s organization on earth insists on following his o\.n ideas and in ignoring ‘the law of his mother’, and puts himself in opposition to the organization of the Lord, he by so doing becomes a worker of iniquity. The meaning of the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iniquity</span><span class="font5"> is not limited to these who commit heinous crimes against others. The word is from “inequity”, meaning </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lawlessness</span><span class="font5"> or one who acts contrary to God's law. It is those who are in line for the kingdom who are in danger of the pitfall of lawlessness. Obedience to the law of the Lord is required, as Jesus says: ‘Not everyone who says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that docs the will of my Father in heaven.’ The Lord then shows that when he comes to the temple for judgment many will think that they should receive the Lord’s everlasting blessing and enter the kingdom, even though they have been following their own selfish course. “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” (Matt 7:22,23) The angels of the Lord solving at the temple are directed by the Lord to oust all such lawless </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">oiks.</span><span class="font5"> “The Son of Alan will semi forth bis messengers, and they will collect out of his kingdom all the cati.ws of stumbling, and the doers of lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of tire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 13:41, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Huth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> One in the covenant with God, and who loves God, will not find any excuse to be offended and to put himself in opposition to God’s organization. If his heart is right, nothing can turn him away from the service of the Lord. He may think he has been unjustly treated by others in God’s organization ; he may feel soiely grieved by reason thereof; but if lie loves God and his law he will conclude that the trial has come upon him and will operate for his own good if he will stand firm for the Lord and in his service, and if he does love God he will do so. “Great peace have they which love thy law; and nothing shall offend them.”—1’s. 119:165.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The man may be forsaken and persecuted by his earthly parents, by his brothers and sisters, and by everyone whom he expects to be his friend, and yet that is no excuse for offense against the Lord and his organization. If one is obedient to the great commandment to love God, nothing will stand in his way of serving God and nothing will cause him to withdraw from the service of the Lord’s organization. “If anyone cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, further also even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.”—Luke 14:26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Based upon God’s commandment to his covenant people the following words arc addressed to the sons of God now on the earth: “Keep yourselves from idols.” (1 John 5:21) “Wherefore, my dearly beloved [brethren], flee from idolatry.” (1 Cor. 10:14) ‘Stubbornness is lawlessness and idolatry.’ (1 Sam. 15: 23) Those in the covenant with God, and who love him and who will receive his ultimate approval, will permit nothing to stand between them and absolute and complete devotion, obedience and service to the Lord within iiis organization. The citizenship of these faithful ones is in heaven. (Phil. 3:20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ruth.)</span><span class="font5"> The Lord Jesus is their King, and has taken his kingdom. The allegiance of the faithful ones is and must be wholly to Ged and his kingdom, and they will refuse to compromise in any manner with the enemy. Like the faithful apostle who has received his crown of life, each one of the faithful remnant now says: “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Horn. 8: 38, 39) In the heart of each one of these is written the law of God, and by his grace they will obey his law.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFULNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah assigned Lucifer to an important position in his organization. Lucifer became greatly impressed with his own importance and coveted that which belonged solely to Jeboxah and to which Lucifer had no right. Perfect from the beginning, fully capable of obeying the Jaw' of God, instead of so doing he became proud and turned to lawlessness or iniquity. (Ezek. 28:15) To carry out his sellidim he invented and publr-hed the first lie, and therefore became Ihe father of lies, whose end is destiuction. For centuries God has permitted the Devil to remain and exercise his lawlessness until God’s due time t &gt;&nbsp;vindicate his Word and name, and this has afforded the opportunity to other creatures Io voluntarily show their lawful obedience or to follow a course of lawlessness, to be faithful or unfaithful, and thus each one becomes responsible for his own destiny.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> God took out from Egypt, the world power over which the Devil had and exercised a control, the descendants of Jacob and caused Moses to lead them through the desert on the wmy to the land of promise. When they reached the land of Moab Moses assemlJed the Israelites and by the direction of Jehovah said to them: “Know therefore that the. Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations; and rcpayelh them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.”—Deut. 7: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Here God was announcing his unchangeable rule that he is faithful always and likewise docs what he promises, and that he requires like faithfulness on the part of all those who enter into a covenant with him. The question then was and now is, Who will stand on the side of Jehovah and there remain steadfast, immovable, dependable and true? Who will maintain his integrity toward God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> It is not enough that a man take his stand on the side of Jehovah and loudly proclaim Jehovah’s name. He must prove his complete devotion to Jehovah under the test. Proud Lucifer was not faithful to his covenant. Since Satan is to be destroyed because of his unfaithfulness, that is the unchangeable rule announced, that all shall suffer a like end who become unfaithful to God. That unchangeable rule is again emphasized by God’s Word: “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.” (Ps. 31:23) “Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my' house; he that tclleth lies shall not tarry in my’ sight. I will early destroy’ all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.”—Ps. 101: G-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The clergy have blasphemously said that God through Christ is holding out his hands, begging men to come to him. That is a wicked, blasphemous statement. The question is not, How many can the Devil get and how many can God get? but is, How many’ under the test will stand firmly’ on the side of Jehovah, maintain their integrity toward God, and live? Can the Devil get all men on bis side and against Jehovah? He will no doubt get the most of them, but there will be many who will maintain their integrity and prove Satan a liar. All the unfaithful shall die, and only the faithful shall live, because God gives life only to the faithful. His blessing is only for those who will remain true and steadfast. But he who makes haste to be rich in power, money, and honor amongst men, that he may’ satisfy his selfishness, is on the road to certain destruction: “A faithful man shall abound with blessings; but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. ’ ’—Prov. 28: 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GUIDE AND WARNING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> God has caused to be recorded in his Word “examples” and “cnsainples” of faithfulness and of unfaithfulness, that such may serve as a guide to those who would do right and a warning to those who are pursuing the wrong course. (1 Cor. 10: G-ll; 1 Thcss. 1:7; 2 Thcss. 3:9; Phil. 3:17) He commands his people to ‘study to show yourself approved unto God’. (2 Tim. 2:15) It is vitally essential that we thus consider the ones who have preceded us and received God’s approval. Furthermore, this rule may be set down as unchangeable, to wit: That no man can be faithful unless he loves God, and if he loves God he will put himself out of the way’ and be diligent in seeking to know and to do the will of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Adam became unfaithful because he did not love God. He did not love Eve, even though he may’ have said he did. Adam desired Eve for himself and desired to have his own way’. The same disposition continues to crop out amongst other men. A man may say: “I love Jehovah and I am faithful.” It is then up to that man to prove what he says. He faces a test in which he must choose between pleasing his wife and serving and pleasing God. The man says: “I love my wife and I will stand by her regardless of what comes.” In fact he docs not love his wife, neither does he love God. If he loved God he would joyfully do the will of God by obeying his commandments, and if he loved his wife, seeing that she had taken a wrongful course, he would point out this fact to her and attempt to guide her in the right way according to God’s Word. The man who really loves God will firmly stand on the side of the Lord and let his course of action be a sample or guide to help those who are near to him by earthly ties and who arc also under the test. One has no excuse or justification for departing from a righteous way in order to help somebody who is out of the way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> It is the small things that disclose faithfulness and unfaithfulness. God did not require of Adam the performance of a great task, but he did require him to be firm, steadfast and obedient. God has not required of those following Christ Jesus to perform great things, but he does require that they remain steadfast, true, faithful and dependable. “Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.” (1 Cor. 4:2) Whatever duty is assigned to one who is in a covenant to do God’s will, that servant must be faithful in the performance of such assigned duty.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Jehovah has never put his stamp of approval upon an unfaithful man, nor one who is partially' unfaithful. God’s rule shows that faithful men of old were approved because of their faithfulness; likewise tho«e of the royal house and of the great multitude must prove faithful and true to the Lord. In God’s organization men arc selected and sent forth to give aid to others that they may’ have a better understanding of their privileges of serving God and Christ. It is a small matter for them to do what they' arc asked to do in the service of the Lord. The truth is not the product of any’ man. The truth is the Word of God, who through Christ Jesus teaches his people. The Lord gives interpretation to his prophecies and causes the same to be published. It is the bounden duty of those sent to the companies of God’s people, therefoie. to give consideration to what is published by the Loi d’s organization for the aid and comfort of his people. If one is sent to a company and he disregards or fails to recognize the Watch Tower publications and the subject matter treated in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and in place and stead thereof substitutes his own private interpretation, the course of that man is both lawless and unfaithful; lawless, because of his failure or refusal to be obedient to organization instructions; unfaithful, because of pride and a disposition to exalt hiraself, and hence a failure to safeguard the kingdom interests. Men are not sent to the companies to exhibit their own learning and wisdom, nor to exhibit the learning of any other man. The kingdom is here, and the Lord’s commandment to those in line for the kingdom is that they must go and tell these great truths to others as a witness to the name of Jehovah. (Matt. 24:14) It is of God, his King, his purpose and his truth that is to be told to the people. As certain as the Lord has caused these truths to be published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the one who fails or refuses to use the same and substitutes his own ideas or teachings is lawless and unfaithful to the duties and obligations laid upon him. This docs not mean that such a servant must read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the companies, but it does mean that he will discuss, consider, and elucidate the subject matter that is treated in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and try to help the members of the companies to get a better understanding thereof, that they may all be better equipped for the service of the Lord as commanded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> If one is placed in a position to represent the Lord’s Society, his organization on earth, and therefore to have a part in the Lord’s witness work, and that person ignores </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the inslrue tions which the Lord gives therein, and substitute-' his own individual ideas aliout the interpretation of prophecy, seeking to make himself appear in the eye of others as learned and important, that man is unfaithful in giving attention to and looking after tiie kingdom interests. Such a person comes clearly within the rule laid down by the inspired Word, to wit: “If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness; from such withdraw thyself.’’ —1 Tim. 6:3-5.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> If one does not believe </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is used by the Lord to transmit to his people the truth, then that one should not attempt to serve in God’s organization. If he docs believe that the Lord uses </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to dispense his truth to his people, then in order to be faithful he will be diligent in carrying out the instructions of the organization and will give consideration to the subjects that arc set forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Any other course tends to confusion and division, which is both unlawful and unfaithful on his part. Persisting in following his own ways and devices contrary to the rules of God’s organization, he will in due time be gathered out from that organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> A man is assigned to the position of service director in a company of God’s people, and receives instructions from the organization of the Lord as to what are his duties. If he is faithful and is serving because he loves God, that servant will gladly be diligent to carry out organization instructions. The service director may think he is wiser than any other in the organization of the Lord, yet that is no excuse for him to insist on doing things in his own selfish way, contrary to the instructions he has received. Service in the organization is not for the purpose of enabling men to shine or show forth their ability. The Lord’s organization must be and will be harmonious and work together harmoniously, and the one causing discord will certainly be removed by the Lord. Therefore no one should attempt to lord it over his brethren or to rule them. The purpose of the servant of God and his work is to aid others, that all in the service may accomplish the will of God to his honor and glory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> Faithfulness also means careful observance and diligence in performing assigned duties. One is sometimes hoard to say: “I love the Lord and I am so glad to be on the Lord’s side.’’ He must be more than that. He must prove his love for God, and ‘this proves one’s love for God, that he obeys his commandments joyfully’. (1 John 5:3) If a task or duty of service is assigned to that one and he is forgetful, indifferent and negligent in the performance thereof, such is clearly proof of unfaithfulness on his part. It shows he is not dependable. It is not the one who says, Lord, I love you, but the one who docs the Lord s will, that proves his faithfulness. (Matt. 7:21) The Lord has committed to his people his goods or kingdom interests. Such interests being entrusted to them, the specific duty of the servant is to be diligent in doing what he is assigned and to do it as unto the Lord, and to make known to others that the kingdom is here and that everything must be subservient to the King and the kingdom. Whatever the task is, do and perform it as unto the Lord. “And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.’’-Col. 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> No servant of the Lord can shirk his duty to the Lord in order that he might please men. Faithfulness means that one must be true, constant and wholly devoted to God and his kingdom interests regardless of what any men may think or say. “Not with eyeserviee, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.’’—Eph. 6: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3T</sup> If there is entrusted to one a duty to perform in the Lord’s organization and, in order that he might please some person and have that person to think well of him, he in any manner compromises or fails to perform fully that duty for this reason, he is to that extent unfaithful. If a man uses fair speech in connection with his performance of duty to the Lord’s organization, and docs so in order that he may have men’s persons in admiration, he is to that extent unfaithful to the Lord. (Jude 16) One who maintains his integrity toward God must be for God and his organization first, last, and all the time, and that without regard to any person connected with the organization or outside of it. How mon may judge you is of no consequence. The Lord’s judgment is of supreme importance. For that reason the true servant of God is blind to evervthing save that which is pleasing to the Lord.—Isa. 42:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> If one thinks to treat lightly the small things committed to him to do and to perform because they are of small moment, such is a tendency to unfaithfulness. Fidelity to the Lord requires one to exercise great care and thoroughness in the performance of duty or in discharging an obligation in the Lord’s organization, however small it may appear to be. If you are assigned to a duty and you say, That is such a small and insignificant matter I will let someone else do it, such is a lack of appreciation of serving the Lord and a lack of fidelity and faithfulness. Honesty and integrity and the discharge of obligation or the performance of duties do not constitute the development of character, but such is proving whether or not we love God and his organization or whether vve will please self or some other creature. If unfaithful in the small things it will be easy for one to be negligent and unfaithful in matters of greater importance, “lie that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much ; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.” (Luke 16:10) The rule for all true followers of Christ Jesus must be fidelity in all things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> In this time of judgment the test is now upon human creatures and is, Who will stand on the Lord’s side against all opposition? The faithful therefore must be constant and unchangeable, always showing allegiance and devotion to God. The question was put squarely up to Moses, and the record of his course of action is made for the purpose of showing what is the correct course for one to take and please God. Having been reared in the royal family of Egvpt, Moses could have received all the honors and plaudits that men might bestow upon another. To receive such he must be unfaithful to God and to his people. The Hebrew's were the chosen people of God and were greatly in disrepute amongst men, and because they were God’s people they suffered at the hands of Satan and his agents. Moses chose to share the afflictions that came upon his fellow Hebrews rather than to enjoy the riches of the great world power. He had faith in God and maintained his integrity. (TIeb. 11:24-26) Moses was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Moses and his faithful fellows refused to yield to the Devil, but remained steadfast and true and received the approval of God. (Ileb. 11:32-39) Thus the rule is definitely fixed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> When Jesus began to perform his covenant the first thing the Devil did was to attempt to cause Jesus to be unfaithful to Jehovah. Hungry and faint after a fast of forty days, it might seem to be a small thing for Jesus to use his power to make some food to refresh his body. The ven’ smallest act of unfaithfulness Jesus would not do. In that and other temptations that followed Jesus declared himself constant and unchangeable toward God and summed up the whole matter by saying: “It is written, Thou shaft worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” (Matt. 4:10) Such must be the rule of all faithful followers of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> To some who have made a covenant to do the will of God it may seem a small thing to salute a flag and sing certain songs of fealty to earthly powers. It is small, but to yield to pressure and to so salute and attribute salvation to any except Jehovah God is an act of unfaithfulness to God. Those in a covenant with God well know that salvation, security, protection and blessings proceed only from God and his kingdom and that there is no other. To salute flags and men means to attribute salvation to them, which is unfaithfulness to Cod. During the past two years this test has been particularly upon Jehovah’s people in Germany. Some have fallen under the test, while others have stood true and firm, preferring to suffer imprisonment, stripes and death rather than to be untrue to God and his kingdom. They have chosen the wise course. It is unl-ten of the faithful men of old who stood firm under persecution that ‘the world was not worthy of them’; and likewise it must be said that those who today withstand persecution and remain firm, constant and faithful to God, the world is not worthy of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The Devil brought to bear upon Christ Jesus al) of his cruel and wicked agencies to cause Jesus to cease bearing the message of his Father to men. Jesus stood firm and immovable, always remaining laithful. Charged with sedition and treason, condemned without any evidence, he was sent to an ignominous death by the political rulers in order to appease the bloodthirsty clergy who were aiding as the Devil’s visible agents. Jesus remained true and steadfast, and therefore God gave to him the title “The Faithful and True”. Jems warns his followers that they must be subjected to similar persecution. (John 15:11', 20) God permits such wicked persecutions to be carried forward by the Devil until his time ends, and this affords to man an opportunity to prove his integrity and to prove the Devil a liar and to have a part in the vindication of God’s name. While his covenant people are passing through these terrible trials Jehovah continues to say to them: ‘God preserveth the faithful.’ (Ps. 31:23) The unfaithful shall perish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The hour of most crucial test is now upon the people of God because Satan knows that his time is short until the final showdown. The unfaithful will compromise and side-step the issue. The true and faithful will remain constant, firm and immovable, regardless of what men may do unto them. They will not fear man, who can only kill them, but their fear is of God. who is able to destroy their very existence. They v.ill not deny 1 he. Lord nor forsake his organization, ht.t remain faithful and true </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">receive his approval. (Hatt. 10:26-35) To those on the Lord’s side, and therefore in the covenant with the Lord, Jesus says: “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">unto </span><span class="font5">death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Rev. 2:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> This does not mean that one must merely believe on God and Christ Jesus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">continue so to believe until death overtakes him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">means that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will, by his grace, remain true and constant, giving unto God and Christ full and complete allegiance, constant, immovable and unbreakable love, and thus they will remain even as they go down into death. They will be faithful unto God and his kingdom when everything is serene, and faithful when opposed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">service </span><span class="font5">by many, and will carry on to the end. They will be faithful in the midst of tribulation and persecution, refusing to yield to the devilish influence and refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. They will steadfastly maintain their integrity even with the very last breath. Men have died faithful to each other for an unrighteous cause. How much greater the privilege of dying faithful unto God and in his righteous cause!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> The faithful and true follower of Christ Jesus, who will ultimately be in God’s royal house, will give all diligence to ‘keep his Father’s commandments’ and will be careful to ‘forsake not the law of God’s or ganization’. Because such love God and his law nothing will cause them to become offended and to turn away from God’s organization and the service thereof. Any part of the kingdom interests that is entrusted to such, be it ever so small, that kingdom interest will be carefully safeguarded, looked after, protected, and the duty and obligation in connection therewith will be honestly performed and discharged. No deviation from faithful performance of duty will be tolerated or permitted; no putting on of the soft pedal in order to please men or to receive the good wishes of men; no compromise with the Devil or any part of his organization. Fidelity in the performance of all duty, constancy and unehangcableness, true and immovable, will be their course of conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> God says that he 'hates that which sows discord amongst the brethren’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Any </span><span class="font5">who insist on murmuring </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">complaining against God’s organization, and who insist on walking after their own selfish desires, are causing discord amongst the brethren. (Prov. 6:16-19 ; Jude 16) Those who cause offense and act in a lawless manner, the Lord will gather out and cast into outer darkness. This he has already shown in his dealing with certain ones. The sons of God who receive his approval must dwell together in peace and must avoid strife. (Psalm 133) The throne of the Greater David is set, and judgment is now in progress, and those of the house of the Lord will say: “Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.” (Ps. 122:7-9) The true and faithful wall maintain their integrity, and therefore will now stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the good news of the kingdom and looking out for and safeguarding the interests of the kingdom, continuing loyal and faithful each to the others who are loyal to God, and thus will continue to do unto the very end. They will ‘never for a moment quail before their antagonists’, but will bravely and firmly and courageously stand for the Lord. Their ‘ fearlessness will now serve as a sure token to the enemy of the enemy’s impending destruction’, and to the faithful ‘their fearlessness will be to them a sure token of salvation from God!’—Phil. 1:28,29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4T</sup> Jehovah has given his Word that he will preserve those who maintain their integrity toward him. ‘Faithful is he who has promised, and he will do it.’ (1 Thcss. 5: 24) Faithful is he who has called you, and he will accomplish his purpose and will vindicate his holy name and will give his faithful ones a part in the vindication thereof.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE PEOPLE AND SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ODAY </span><span class="font5">the earth seems to have forgotten Jehovah God. Truly the words of the psalmist apply now concerning the agents of Satan who pretend to be Christians: “God is not in all his thoughts.’’ (Ps. 10:4) At the present time human policies, human greed, and position of pov.er and wealth havo brought their harvest to the full. At the present time, though there is much profession amongst so-called “Christian’’ communities, the thoughts of the people composing “organized Christianity” are far from God. Not only are their thoughts removed from God, but such hypocrisy is practiced openly in the name of the Lord that it casts reflection upon his name, which makes it now necessary for the Lord to destroy the organization of the earth exen as he destroyed the world or wicked organization in the great flood of Noah’s day. The latter are really the ‘destroyers of the earth’, as Jesus called them. (Rev. 11 : IS) People are much to blame for their lack of knowledge of .Jehovah, They have had the opportunity to follow the teachings of Jehovah rather than of the wicked one and his earthly leaders, but their greed and selfishness have made them forget God. The course of ancient Egypt foretells the course of the whole world. In former times Egypt alone was involved, but now the whole world is involved. Today the poor are oppressed by those in authority. The religious teachers have frightened many of the people and burdened them with the nightmare of eternal torment, while others have been so thoroughly disgusted with their religion that they have turned entirely away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan’s visible organization, made up of the religious, commercial and political elements, is referred to in the Scriptures under the symbol of a wild beast. Many of the people, cither by coercion or by choice, have “the mark of the beast” (Rev. 13:16) in this, that they mentally and actively support the Devil's organization. There are millions of people in so-called “organized Christianity” who v,ink at the evil deeds and hypocritical practices of “organized Christianity”. Many other millions are held in subjection by fear. They claim to be the people of the Lord; but, by their course of action in cither openly or tacitly approving the conduct of the leaders who reproach God, they prove themselves to be only professed people of God, and not his people in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, through his prophet, foretold this condition that we now see existing in the world. Concerning this time it is written: “For among my [professed] people arc found wicked men [clergymen who pretend to represent God and jet in fact reproach his name] ; they lay wait, as he that setteth snares: they set a trap, they catch men [they’ inveigle men into their organizations regardless of whether they have any faith in God or not]. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses |organizations] full of deceit: therefore they [the clergy’, the leaders ami principal ones of their flock] are become great, and waxen rich. They arc waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked [tiiey wink at the wicked deeds of politicians and Dig Business as well as those of the preachers] : they judge not [righteously] the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper: and the right of the needy do they not jud&quot;e”; the people need the truth, but they do not give it to them; they do not properly and 1 ighteously consider what the people need. They feed them on politics, “science” so called, and other like pioxisions. The Lord thus describes the miserable condition of “organized Christianity” of the pie’.ent time. Never before was there such hj poerisy practiced in the name of the Lord. Then God caused his prophet to saj’ further: “Shall I not visit foi' these things? saith the Lord: shall not mj’ soul be avenged on such a nation as this? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land [‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’] ; the prophets [clergy] prophesy falsely, and the priests [those who have responded to God’s call and have been in line for his royal priesthood] bear rule by their means; and my [professed] people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof ? ’ ’—Jcr. 5: 26-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God declares through his prophet Jeremiah his purpose to visit “organized Christianity” with a time of trouble such as man has never known. God will not take this action, however, without giving due notice. The time for serxing such notice, or for the testimony’ to be given, he indicates must be shortly preceding the great trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To accomplish his work in giving such notice God must have sonic instrument or some persons to be his witnesses. The work corresponds to that which was done by’ Moses when appearing before Pharaoh of Egypt. The people are kept in ignorance and oppressed, and now the Lord will take action. At this time God has not raised up an individual to do his work, but he has raised up a company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus, whom he names his “servant”. Those who go to make up this “servant” are the ones found faithful and approved by the Lord at the time of coming to his temple, and to such he has committed the work of giving the testimony; and God commissioned them thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people taken out for the name of Jehovah must be the ones whom he uses and will use to inform the rulers and the people concerning his purposes. Having come to Zion, and having built it up and brought his approved ones into the temple condition, the Lord informs them that there is a work for them to do, and that such work consists in giving testimony to the name of Jehovah God and in speaking forth his purposes concerning the wicked organization and his purpose concerning the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It follows that those who arc taken out to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah would be the servants of the Most High. Concerning his “servant” God caused his prophet to write, saying: “Behold my servant, whom 1 uphold, mine cleet, in whom my soul delightetb; 1 have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring foith judgment to the Gentiles [the nations].” —Isa. 42:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servant mentioned by that prophet is Christ Jous, upon whom the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Loud</span><span class="font5"> put his spirit after his baptism in the Joidan river. “Christ” means the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">anointed,</span><span class="font5"> and therefore all who are brought into the body of Christ and receive the anointing of the holy spirit, and are thereby made partakers of Christ, become a part of that servant. For in his inspired letter to the Galatians, the apostle Paul says to the Chiis-tians: “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He [Jehovah God] saith . . . And to thy seed, which is Christ. For as many of you as have been baptized into Chiist have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” of Jehovah God. (Gal. 3:16,27-29) When, in the year 1918 (A.D.), the Lord Jesus came to his spiritual temple and took an account with his servants and found some who had been faithful, he approved the faithful ones. These are shown in the prophecy of Isaiah as being brought under the robe of righteous-ne<sup>5</sup>s and being given the garments of salvation. (Isa. 61:10) The “garments of salvation” identify such as members of the “servant” of the Most High, while “the robe of righteousness” shows them as approved servants of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointing of the holy spirit is the commission work to do, and these member's of his body must participate in the work because they form a part of the “servant”. As Jesus declared that he came into the world to bear witness to the truth, even so must the anointed members of his body bear witness to the truth. The commission given to those anointed ones supports this conclusion. The statement of 1he authority set out in that commission applies to all who arc the anointed of the Lord and who are brought under the robe of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Be it iroted that the commission received by reason of the anointing provides that the “servant” must ‘preach good tidings unto the meek [or teachable] ; bind up the broken-hearted; proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; and comfort all that mourn’. (Ka. 61:1,2) That commission is broad and comprehensive, but is even more specifically defined by other prophecies of the Lord. Since the commission applies to the entire Christ, there must be a time when Christ will cause a testimony to be given concerning God’s vengeance. It is certain that the vengeance of God is to be manifest against the enemy organization, and the purpose of the testimony concerning the same is to give notice to men, both rulers and the people, in order that they may have an opportunity to know that Jehovah is the Almighty God, and to separate themselves from the enemy organization before the destruction thereof comes to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in the year 1914 that the Lord Jesus received his kingdom and began to exercise his royal powir. After casting Satan out of heaven, the Lord came to his temple and commissioned his faithful servants. This is shown by his own words in the parable of the pounds and of the talents. (Matt. 25:14-30; Luke 19:11-27) It is to that approved company, brought, into the temple, that the Lord commits all his kingdom interests on earth. Concerning such the great Prophet Jesus himself said: “Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.”—Matt. 24:44-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is this servant class that the Lord makes “ruler over many things”, according to the picture given in the paiable of the talents. (Matt. 25:21) It is this class whom the Lord God has taken out as “a people for his name”, and since they arc taken out “for his name”, their work must of necessity be that of giving testimony to his name. This is the class described by the disciple James at the convention in Jerusalem. His</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful class on earth, the people taken out for God’s name, constitute, figuratively speaking, the “feet” of Jesus Christ, because they are the last members of his body on earth. It becomes the privilege of such to be God’s special witnesses. This is exactly in accord with the prophecy of Isaiah (52:7) which states: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">feet of him</span><span class="font5"> that bringeth good tidings, that publishcth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that pub-lisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reign-eth! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the class that specially testifies to the fact that the nation or kingdom of the Lord is born or begun, and that God through Christ Jesus has begun his reign. They who are members of Zion, which is God’s organization, say to one another: “Thy God rcign-eth!” It is this faithful servant class that constitutes God’s watchmen. They watch the unfolding of prophecies; and, watching, they ascertain God’s will, and tell one another what they sec, and also tell others who have the desire to hear; and this is exactly in accord with the words of the prophet: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.” (Isa. 52:8) By reason of the lightnings of divine truth flashing from Jehovah God upon Jesus the Ilead of the temple class, the members of the temple class are enlightened and God’s Word is illuminaled, and they see the truth exactly in harmony with one another; and together they joyfully give testimony by singing the praises of Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S BLESSING MANIFEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Ruthlkhird:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the annual meeting of the Sydney [N.S.W., Australia] company it was decided to convey to you our love and assure you that the company is wholly with you in your leadership in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization and that we are all determined to continue in the great fight come what may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It also decided that a report of the work for the year just closed be sent to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the statement attached tiie figures for the years 1933, 1934 and 1935 are shown side by side, and in the fourth column is given the increase of 1935 over 1931. The blessing of the Lord was upon our efforts and, by his grace, vve were able to place in 37,777 hours 94,908 pieces of hteratuie. Hours in the field were nearly 11,000 moie thau in 1931, and the literature placed increased by 40,217 pieces. The transcription Work is gathering momentum, and so great is the inteiest shown that it will require real hard work to attend to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> on “The Great Multitude’’ spurred us on with a desire to accomplish the work quickly so that the people of good will may speedily be apprised of the Kingdom. Evening work with the phonographs is opening the way for tianscription meetings. Parties of publishers work two by two, and where interest is shown phonograph lectures are given. Questions are invited and, instead of spending too much time answering the questions, it is suggested that further lectures be given on a second visit. ’This paves the way for transcription lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everything possible is done to get the Jonadabs into the work, and in the year theie was an increase of 74 publishers reporting. Each special campaign a quota form is sent out so that every publisher may state what days, the time of day and the total hours he hopes to spend in the field. All the interested are systematically- called upon and given an opportunity to share in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are grateful to Jehovah for his manifest blessing and for the direction we receive in the work through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font4"> and other means. May the Lord continue to bless you as you boldly declare his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WILLING TO PASS BENEFIT ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your letter to the pioneers, dated November 5, is at hand and contents noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With deep appreciation we acknowledge that letter. We the pioneers here in our bunch have been making it very nicely. We have no reason to complain or to feel that vve were having a hard time yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our method is this: Our friends at Mt. Lookout are all about of one family. They grow plenty of truck on the farm to keep US going. Every once in a while they bring us a small truckload of such things as we are needing. That keeps us going, and vve know vve have plenty of provisions as long ns tlmy have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We appreciate very much all that you have done for us. and I have not written you about it, simply because I felt that your tunc is very precious and what I may say would not be of any value to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But when this last letter came to my hands, that the Bethel family had agieed to take a reduction in their allowance, whatever this may be, for our benefit, or, in other word-', to keep the Lord’s work going in the field, I could not withhold expressing our feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Give the family our deepest appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are just as willing to give the reduction that is allowed us to go to some other pioneer that is needing it worse thau we.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours by his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Butheriord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wo wish to express to you our appreciation of your kind favor extended to the pioneeis in your recent b-tter, which wo received with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Director,</span><span class="font4"> November 1 issue. Only- a God like Jehovah God is able to strengthen and make glad the hearts of his people. How wo thank him for Ins lovimr-ktn Inoss and those who permit him to use them to prepaie and put into our hearts the wonderful means, that all the world may know that he, Jehovah God, is the only true God, and with you and your never ceasing efforts to feed his sheep, we may be faithful coltiborers in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thanking you for your love and ardent labor for all of God's true people, we send to you our Christian love, praying always God’s protection and wonderful strength to continue on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIGHT SHINING BRIGHTLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font4">want to expicss my heartfelt appreciation to you, and to the Society, for the wonderful arrangement just made, as noted from your letter of November 5, sent to all pioneers, to help them to continue in the field sei vice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is so noticeable how brightly the light is shining upon Zion the last few years, as our zeal is increasing, and improvements to headquarters to handle present problems of servo e are also increasing, to such an astonishing degree that we pioneers can haidly keep up, REJOICING!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May Jehovah's stiength, guidance, protection and love continue to keep you faithful unto the end, is my piuyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rejoicing in the privilege of a part in his t-eivne, I am Yours in his seivice by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">T. R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Weeks, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MACHINES A WONDERFUL HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Devr Brother J.w. :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your kind, loving letter has been read and reread, and it touches our hcaits to know and realize the love and unity of the Lord’s people as manifested in the desire of the dear Bethel family to sacrifice still more in order that this part of Gideon's army may continue in the aggressive. We often discuss the indifference, the opposition, the huge number of books aheady m rhe hands of the people, the near and tear of our equipment, and wonder how long we will be able to continue in the enjoyment of the privilege o witnessing in Jehovah's name to the demolishing of the Devil’s playhouse. We always end our discussions by saying that if the Lord, our Captain, considers us worthy of this privilege and wants us to continue he will make it possible for us to do so. And it is even so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We regard this latest provision as of the Lord and expressed through his people. Please convey to the whole family our appreciation and thanks for their loving kindness in this act in our behalf. Wo also want to thank you for the many gifts of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Hooks,</span><span class="font4"> volumes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wtrtclitowris, Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> and other things you have so graciously bestowed on us in the past. We do not often write to tell you of our thanks, but do not think wo do not feel them. Your time is precious, and so is ours; so we do not wiite muili.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had an expei icnec lately which shows how mad Satan is, and how zealous his agents to stop the witness woik. A sister of our camp witnessed to a lady in Baxley, who became somewhat excited, accused us of being Communists and against the government and of tearing down the churches. No amount of explanation could show her that we ato for God’s kingdom and against nothing at all except the Devil anil his unrighteous lule. None are so blind as those who do not want to see. Next evening wo vveie waited on by a committee of four men. Ono was the school pnncipal, the husband </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of the aforementioned </span><span class="font4">lady; and nil lepresenting the Amfinan legion. '1 hey tiled to tiap Brother Bowen into saying something they might con-sfiuc ns against the government; but the Lord was with us, unknown to our accusers. They ended their investigation by taking seven booklets to send to the American Legion head-quaiters. Wo could but laugh, knowing that, the Amenean Legion has had plenty of witness and that they ale divided amongst themselves. Our neighbor is one of them, and he was Bin prised and displeased by the action of his brother Li gioni.its.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now a word or two about the transenptiou machines and phonographs. What a wonderful help they arc in gaining people’s attention and in placing the books! The foui-and-one-half minute lectures answer many a hard question that comes up. And now the song lecoid.s also bring cheer to tho hearts of tho lonely, hard-piessed pioneeis, if to no one else. But others also exptess their appieciation of the sweet music. When the beloved sweet singer of Bind returns to earth, he will have to go some if he excels the Watchtower quartette in singing his own sweet psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured of our love and co operation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Condensations of Canadian News</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font10">ROWDED out by the stress of events in Germany, Massachusetts, and Central Africa, 51 neatly typed pages of “Events in Canada”, by our Canadian correspondent, enough to fill a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font10"> now demand attention. They must be condensed desperately, with the hope of treating the Canadians better at some future time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They have discovered a new, picturesque and safer route from Hudson bay to Hudson strait. It will lengthen the navigation season ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tariff walls between the United States and Canada have broken down somewhat, to the mutual advantage of both countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is serious talk of diverting the flow of the Nipigon river from Hudson bay to Lake Superior: the claim is that 392,000 horsepower could be developed at an expense of $3,000,000. This would raise the water levels at Montreal 1.4 inches and benefit all the Lakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Canada’s second largest business is caring for tourists from the United States. Wheat comes first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Government is getting after the Quebec hotels to bring them to a higher standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Canada will shortly have a Blue Book on its tropical, hot-water valleys in the Liard valley of the far north, where grass grows seven feet long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ambrose Small, Toronto theater man, disappeared in 1919, the next day after selling his theater interests for one million dollars in cash. His wife has just died, leaving the whole fortune to the Roman Catholic “church”, and it is supposed Ambrose was bumped off to make sure the church would get the swag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Group hospitalization is being advertised widely in Canada; it is an arrangement whereby subscribers pay so much a week to a hospital fund. A confidence man in Vancouver stood up four surgeons in the same day for $15 each, on the ground that he wanted to have his appendix taken out immediately. He did not show up at the time and place agreed upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Canadian kids have a paragraph of their own. Some of their answers to examination questions are: “Instead of ships going overland, they go by water, which is easier.” “Hemp is a kind of hair used on cowboys.” “The religion of India is the cask system.” “The people of China are Budests, and of Japan Budapests.” “Lines which join places having the same atmospheric pressure are called baritones.” “A continental shelf is a shallow body of water where fish come to spoon.” “Gutta percha is the chief beverage of the people of Brazil.” “Laura Secord was </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">notable woman clad only in slippers.” “The advantage of the Soo Canal is that boats can sail through it instead of having to portage around.” “Australia is a very fertile country because so many British people have settled there.” “The Saar is a piece of land that the Russian Saar owned.” “China has remained so little influenced by other countries because it is smarter.” “The chief seaport of Paris is Bologny.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning the epidemic of flag-saluting patriotism in the United States, the Vancouver </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New Herald</span><span class="font10"> said: “There are two ways to end such incidents. The one is to stop trying to build up synthetic patriotism; the other, to adopt a state religion and compel observance on penalty of the stake and the gallows. The first method is much more satisfactory than the second.” (And yet 22 of the ‘Idiotic States of America’ have fallen for the Roman Hierarchy plan.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Westmount, Quebec, where Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested time and again, all workers in the district visited the city en masse, American style, called on the chief of police and the mayor, and placed 1,200 pieces of literature in the town, all without interference. A similar method was used in stopping the senseless persecutions in Ville St. Pierre (where two women</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">were sent to jail for ten days by one of Quebec’s rotten judges, without even knowing that they had been on trial).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Harry H. Stevens, former minister of trade and commerce, has made the official statement that twelve men practically own and control Canada, which, for that reason, is all ripe for Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Twice in seven years wounded geese have flown to the home of Jack Miner, Kingsville, where they had previously been treated kindly, and walked straight up the path to the front door, so that they might die among friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a village in Manitoba there will be made a two-year test of a health insurance scheme in which everybody in the town will be given free medical care, free hospitalization, including surgery, and free medicine, all at the general expense of the taxpayers. Everybody will be vaccinated and serumized for diphtheria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In three months Uncle Sam bought ten million bushels of Canadian wheat, “brain trust” plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Vancouver </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Province</span><span class="font10"> thinks the Canadian government is making a mistake to suppose that young men will be willing to be herded permanently into old people’s homes for the young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Ontario government adopted an “Adopt-a-Baby” campaign, and in two weeks were out of babies, all the youngsters having found good homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The golden-eyed fishes of Lake Manitoba, accounted by some the finest eating fish in the world, are now almost extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persons convicted of crime in Canada no longer have the privilege of appeal to the British Privy Council. In other words, in a retrograde, priest-ridden province like Quebec the legal decisions obtainable are the last word until Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Canada has made some shipments of hogs and cattle to the United States; a natural result of the AAA laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Canada has rulers galore: 96 senators, 245 members of the House of Commons, and 44,000 civil servants at and from Ottawa; in the provincial legislatures, 63 for Alberta, 47 for British Columbia, 55 for Manitoba, 48 for New Brunswick, 30 for Nova Scotia, 90 for Ontario, 30 for Prince Edward Island, 114 for Quebec, and 63 for Saskatchewan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A Roman Catholic judge of Quebec ruled that a Protestant and Catholic when married by properly appointed officials are not properly married unless married by a priest. That is Roman Catholic Fascism, pure and simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Families on relief in Toronto are allowed $5.69 per week for groceries, meat, vegetables, butter, bread, and milk, for a family of five. Clothing is supplied. Shoes are repaired by city order. Water is paid for by the city; also light and gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Providences in New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font10">AYS Carl W. Reichardt, of New Zealand: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> is the only paper with any real news. I have just finished reading No. 411, and it was reading. Judge Rutherford’s address ‘Government’ sure was some address. If it isn’t the truth, well, I don’t know what truth is. I have read all Judge Rutherford’s books, about fifteen of them, the last five being autographed copies, and the way they explain the Bible, well, they make it as clear as daylight, and the sooner God’s kingdom under Christ is established, the better. I have been lending my books to my neighbors; several have taken notice and firmly believe what they say about God’s Word. One very good thing I have learned from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age:</span><span class="font9"> the articles on aluminum are the absolute truth. It is a funny thing how some people will take notice and others, well, I don’t know what to make of them; they won’t listen at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I must tell you about a rather thrilling experience. I was down in Wellington for a day or two, and while there I met a friend of mine. While talking together about different things we got to discussing the Bible. I could see he had hold of the wrong idea, so I told him a bit about it. He told me to come out to his place, which I did. Well, he had a big Roman Catholic Bible there. I showed him a few things and he started to think then, but had to go out on an errand. While he was out I was wondering how to go on when he came back; I was wishing I had some of my books. While I was waiting a lady called at the door. The little boy went out to see what she wanted. Of course, he told her there was nobody home, as both his parents were out, so she turned to go away. While doing so she spotted me standing by the window, so she came back and said to the boy, ‘I want to see that man.’ I went out and as I saw what she was carrying I said to her, ‘You have got Judge Rutherford’s books.’ She looked at me as if she did not know what to say. I asked her if she had a full set of the books; she did not, but she would get them; her car was down the road a bit. She was not long getting them, and also booklets; so I made a present of them to my friend. He was pleased to get them. He knew all about the Catholic Hierarchy; he did not have much good to say about them. He said they were robbers and worse.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>A New Zealander’s Cry of Disappointment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">NEW ZEALAND subscriber, an ex-service man, writes of his homeland disappointedly. First he encloses a clipping showing that in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hollford Valley 250 men have camped four years in tents without floors, surrounded on all sides by millions of feet of timber, and with a sawmill only a short distance away. At times the snow is two feet deep around these tents. The subscriber wants to know why these 250 men have not been men enough to rectify these conditions, in spite of the numerous notices in the camp that any man taking a stick of timber will be dismissed and prosecuted. And then he sets down his own story as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“One of the Roman emperors (a Caesar) once remarked that: If you gave the great mass of the people sufficient wine to drink, and circuses and bull fights and gladiator fights to amuse them, you could do anything you liked to them (or with them)—knock them down, kick them, abuse them, insult them—and they would stand for it. They are certainly like that in New Zealand today, still. If you give them a couple of glasses of beer, a tin of tobacco, and a free pass to a football match or a boxing tournament (even if you told them that there was no money and no food this week), they wouldn’t ‘buck’ at all; only grumble for a few seconds, and soon forget all about it, in the excitement of the prospect of seeing a ball game or wrestling match. No depth of mind, no mental ballast; like a ship with all sails set, but no ballast or cargo, and no one at the helm, at the mercy of every change of wind that blows. You can’t have much respect for them. Lots of coolies in Asia have more mental depth or ballast in them than lots of ‘poor whites’ seem to have. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">N S. J. League will be formed in New Zealand. Instead of being under the control of “Reverend” Charles E. Coughlin, it will be managed by “Reverend Father” Charles Higgins, who received his instructions from Mr. Coughlin. “S. J.” stands both for Coughlin’s so-called “Social Justice” and also for “Society of Jesus” [Jesuits],</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Air Excursions to Isle of Wight</span></h3>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">AST season air excursions to the Isle of Wight were popular. Americans in large numbers made use of the time between their boat trains and the boats themselves, at Southampton, to hop to the Isle of Wight and enjoy its many interesting oddities.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Swell Dressers in Britain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font10"> tells about the swell dressers at the Abbey church of Downside. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The eye was caught by the high white Roman mitre worn by Cardinal Seredi over his scarlet skullcap ; the long scarlet train of Cardinal MacRoy of Armagh [the same one that dodged the rain at the show in Sydney]; the brown habit and bare sandalled feet of the Franciscans . . . ; the superbly-enamelled and jewelled crosses on the breasts of some of the bishops and the white silk shoes of the abbot, with their exquisite gold embroidery, under his black cappa magna and its 14-foot train. The massed blacks of the 80 Downside monks threw into relief the vivid purples and reds of the visiting clergy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The British miners are desperately trying to get 50c per week more for their work, setting forth that on their present wages their entire earnings go for food to merely keep them alive. But no matter what comes, every girl in Britain will insist that the abbot’s white silk shoes, in their gold embroidery, are just too lovely for anything, and his 14-foot train was just too grand for words.

<p><span class="font10">RITISH people earnestly want peace, and said so pointedly when 11,627,765 men and women, 38 percent of all the residents of Great Britain over 18 years of age, voted in the peace ballot. Of this great number, 11,090,387 voted for Britain to stay in the League of Nations, 10,470,489 voted for reduction of armaments by international agreement, 10,417,329 for prohibition of the private manufacture of armaments by international agreement, 10,027,608 for economic pressure on one nation that insists on attacking another, and 9,533,558 for the abolition of national military and naval aircraft by international agreement. The vote is utterly worthless and impractical except as an expression of a real desire for peace and safety on the part of the voters. The governments will go along and do as they are told by the International Murderers, Limited, the real bosses in Britain as they are everywhere. What the people need, and their only possible relief from these intolerable conditions, is the kingdom of God which is about to destroy all the works of the Devil all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tried Everything Else</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. E. M. Kerriush (Tasmania)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10"> FEEL I would like to tell you a little story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About two years ago I had a little boy of nine very sick for about twelve months. He always had pains and was so sick we took him to three doctors. He did not seem to get any better. In fact, his knees began to give way and he could hardly walk. We were getting very worried and took him to the doctor again, who said he was afraid our son had paralysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One day Mrs. K., one of your workers, said, “How is your boy ?” I told her he did not seem to improve, with all the medicine he had taken. Mrs. K. said to me, “Now, what do you cook in?” Well, I thought that a strange question, as if that had anything to do with my son’s illness. I said, “Here are the pots and pans, all aluminum.” The lady said, “Well, if you want your boy to get better, throw all that wretched stuff out.” I thought it over and, knowing I had tried all I knew to help my boy, decided to try what cooking in iron pots and pans would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a month from that day my boy was a new child. He lost his pains and was not sick, and his legs began to get the strength back in them. Really, it was wonderful. And from that day I have not used an aluminum pot, and never will. I proved it was slowly poisoning my child. In fact, the whole family was often sick after a meal, but since leaving off cooking in the wretched stuff we are all so different. I have your worker, Mrs. K., to thank for telling me about it. I am so pleased to see in this week’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> quite a lot about aluminum. Do tell the world about it; for it is deadly stuff. I thought you would like to hear from Tasmania from a very grateful person.</span></p>

Their one school in Britain was denounced before investigation as “of negligible importance, inefficient for its purpose, and, above all, in thoroughly dishonest hands”. It seems too bad that a few men whose own methods are so generally distrusted should be given the power to throttle the wishes of millions of people as to the methods they wish used to help them when they are ill.</span></p>

Parents should probably hurry up and do this before somebody discovers that the toxoid is just as worthless or evil in its effects as the toxin-antitoxin, but just why the bishop of Toronto should rush into print to misuse a text of God’s Word in a campaign to help out the serum-peddlers is hard to understand.</span></p>

Nevertheless, there are faithful ones who are continuously active to feed the hungry ones, until they too are imprisoned. We all are continuously spied upon by our neighbors. Every eight to fourteen days the police search our homes, turning everything upside down, in order to discover forbidden literature. Where a trial is held, the public is excluded. I know brethren who were taken into custody and then were deported to a concentration camp; later a trial followed, after which they spent two or more months in prison; and at the end of their prison terms they have been brought again to camp, which they do not leave any more. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A 38-year-old man was a member of the Association of Earnest Bible Students, which has been suppressed by decree of the Secret State Police of September 28, 1934. Instead of obeying the law, the defendant held it expedient to celebrate, on April 17, 1935, in his home, the Memorial, together with his wife and her friend. The result was a charge for violation of the law. Brought before the bars of the Emergency Court, the defendant stated that he knew of the decree, but he did not consider himself guilty of a crime by celebrating the Memorial together with only two other persons. They simply ate of the bread and drank of the wine and read from the Bible. A similar testimony was given by the two women. The prosecution was of the opinion that this was a case of violation of the law, since the Bible Students as enemies of the State are prohibited to assemble themselves. The verdict was six weeks’ imprisonment for the man, and 150 marks fine for each of the women.</span></p>

Before long you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from the platform and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers, as earlier, but do not dare to say so. And now the whole nation, pulpit and all, will take up the war cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths will cease to open.

<p><span class="font9">“San Francisco bay is the best harbor on the Pacific coast and one of the finest in the world. The large sheltered deep water area and a great amount of shore line offer almost unlimited opportunities for terminal and industrial water-front development. San Francisco is the only port in the United States where the waterfront is owned and has been developed by the State, and where, also, the public terminal developments have been connected with one another and with rail carriers by a belt line, owned and operated by the State. San Francisco is a shining example of efficient control of terminal and interchange facilities. There is no friction, no congestion, no delays at this port. Traffic moves to and from the piers with smoothness and facility, which is noticeably absent at some ports not adequately co-ordinated. The flat switching charge between any two points on the Belt Line serves to avoid the overdevelopment and congestion which tend to occur where ports are improperly divided into zones for switching purposes. In this respect, San Francisco is an example of efficiency which many ports would do well to emulate.”</span></p>

The doctors often go away and leave them to die in places where there are no chairs, no tables, no dishes and no food. The Indian agents are for the most part absolutely heartless. The whites take advantage of the Indians in every possible and conceivable form. If an Indian has good lands the white tries to get the lands away, and has been known to pay largely in notes unsecured, non-interest-bearing, nontransferable, and therefore worthless. The Indians are the personification of kindness and generosity toward the helpless among their own people, and never turn anybody away, white or Indian. Reverend Heuel testified that he has an affidavit where an Indian agent stole every month $1,500 from the meat allowance for the Indians, by means of true weight bills and false weight bills. He told of where one family of 12 people got 6 cans of milk to last them an entire month. On the La Jolla (California) Indian reservation one old lady 10G years of age slept at night in an ash pit, that being the only warm place she could find. Thomas L. Sloan, an Omaha Indian, tells of a family of Indian farmers who were capable and honest men, living practically like white people, and rented out some of their land, who were compelled to go to an agency and trade with their trader and were charged at least 100 percent more than they had been paying at the town store where they had been trading. They were also compelled to make their leases of land through the Indian Office, instead of being permitted to handle this matter themselves as they had been doing in an entirely satisfactory and efficient way. He stated that “by the restrictive imposition of rules and regulations which changed and prevented a natural development in the course of their lives”, the Indians had been prevented from making progress. The Indian sums it all up in his philosophy: “White man no good: lie too much.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">erald Barry, prisoner of the Lord for two months in Quebec, found the prisons tolerable as respects food, exercise, cleanliness and discipline, but made one point worth publicizing : “The principal difficulty with the food was that it was cooked in aluminum. This, of course, was not the fault of the authorities, but is due to a lack of knowledge on the subject of aluminum. The writer was quite sick for one week while in prison, which was doubtless caused by the food’s being cooked in aluminum. While the commission which the Lord’s people have received is to preach the kingdom of God, and to declare His judgments, to which they must be completely faithful, if they would have His approval, yet the explaining to the people that food cooked in aluminum vessels is very detrimental to health is certainly in line with doing good unto all men as we have opportunity. The people are in great need of information on the subject of aluminum, and seemingly they will not get this information through the channels of the Devil’s organization.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE Bible furnishes the correct information concerning the origin of man, his course, and his destiny. Adam, the first man, was created by the Lord from the elements of the earth. That man was perfect. God endowed Adam and Eve with the power to conceive and bring forth children and thus to fill the earth with intelligent creatures. Before they exercised that power they were guilty of willful disobedience, for which God sentenced them to death and expelled them from Eden their perfect home. Thereafter all the offspring of man, as stated by the Scriptures, were conceived in sin and born in iniquity. (Romans 5:12; Psalm 51:5) Adam willfully preferred to obey the Devil and to disobey God, and for that reason he fell. Disobedience to God’s law always brings disaster upon the wrongdoer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Punishment for willful disobedience is death. Man is a mortal creature, meaning that he is subject to death. (1 Corinthians 15:53) The Devil has induced men to believe the false doctrine that man has an immortal soul. The Scriptures show that man is a soul, meaning that he is a breathing, living creature. (Genesis 2:7) It is written at Ezekiel 18:4: “The soul that sin-neth, it shall die.” The facts support the scripture that men die and that the death of man is because of sin.—Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since all men are the descendants of Adam, the sinner, does that mean that ultimately all men will perish ? That would be the final result unless God provides a way for the recovery of man from death. It is written, at Romans 6: 23, that life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ, and, at Acts 4:12, that there is no other name whereby men can be saved and gain life. Before man can receive the gift of life he must learn what God requires him to do. That which is required is set forth plainly in the Bible, which God has provided for the guiding of men in the right way. The books </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font10"> will enable you to find all the Bible texts bearing on this subject. The fundamental truths there fully considered are here stated in brief, to wit: That God made provision for the redemption of man by providing that another perfect man might die as a substitute for or in the place of the perfect man Adam, who sinned; that there was no man to meet that divine requirement; that God then made the man Jesus a perfect man, a little lower than the angels, that He might suffer death in the place and stead of the sinner, to redeem sinners. (Hebrews 2:9) The man Christ Jesus fully proved His obedience to God under the greatest trial and suffered an ignominious death as a sinner. Because of His full obedience God raised up Jesus out of death and made Him the author of eternal salvation to all who believe on, serve and obey Him. Christ Jesus is now fully possessed with power and authority to give life everlasting to every person that truly believes on Him and faithfully serves Him and God. Everlasting life of man is the gift from God, and whether he receives and holds to this gift depends upon his faithful obedience to God. The great sacrifice of Christ Jesus is for the benefit of all those who do so believe and obey. All others will perish for ever, as it is written: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John 3:36) Man’s greatest privilege, therefore, is to know and to serve God and Christ Jesus, as it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, are trying to help men to gain that much-needed knowledge by bringing them in contact with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is written, at Proverbs 3:13,14: “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding; for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.” Gold and all material things bring no lasting happiness. The correct understanding of man’s relationship to his Creator, and what is man’s future, is of greatest importance to him. Not all good men go to heaven. In fact, a very few will ever be in heaven, and those are the ones whom God places in His royal house. The home of natural man is the earth. God created man for the earth, and the earth for man, and those who obey the Lord will live on the earth. Under the rulership of Christ Jesus all wickedness and selfishness amongst men will be destroyed and those who love righteousness and do right will inherit the earth. It will be a real pleasure to live among neighbors that are kind, considerate and always doing right. It will be a real joy to live when the people know that all crime has ceased, and that sickness and death will never affect them again. Then, as it is written in the Psalms, every creature that lives will be praising God the Creator, who is the Giver of all good things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(Translation from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">National-Zeitung,</span><span class="font8"> Basle, Switzerland)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10">T FIRST sight it seems strange that such a harmless religious society as that founded by the American Russell, called “Earnest Bible Students”, or, as they call themselves now, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” should be persecuted so much by the “Gestapo” [Geheime Staats-Polizei —Secret State Police]. We are informed that there are still about 1,500 of these God-fearing and good people in prisons and concentration camps. In August 1933 their writings, including about 400 Bibles, real Bibles, were burnt by the Nazis near Magdeburg. (Seein Langhoff’s</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Moor-soldaten</span><span class="font10"> the pointed description of the strange treatment of the Bible Students by German officials [authorities].)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, when one knows that this sect has from one to two million friends and adherents in Germany and that the Earnest Bible Student, based upon the certainly unequivocal word of the apostle, ‘We ought to obey God rather than men,” declines the “Heil-Hitler-Gruss”, then one understands that it was an unpleasant thing for the founders of the “Third Reich” to see these Christians among them and that such attitude led to prohibitive measures, suppression and persecution. They discontinued their official meetings, but—is it not written that “where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font10"> And did not the first Christians in Rome secretly meet in the catacombs in the same spirit in spite of Nero and in spite of the prohibition of their meetings by the Roman “Gestapo”? So the Gestapo have their trouble with the Bible Students and on the 17th of December there begins in Halle a big lawsuit against the imprisoned leaders of the Bible Students, Balzereit and Dollinger, because of activity inimical to the State. As an excuse for the persecution of these “heretics” (as this term is used by the National Socialists), they have been charged with being under Jewish influence, which is entirely wrong. The Gestapo has closed their printing plant, which printed their paper </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> and their tracts. However, they are allowed to ship the machines abroad. The technical manager, Joh. Meier, a Swiss, recently went to Basle in order to meet there his English and American brethren and to liquidate the German business of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. Before his arrival in Switzerland he had the misfortune that the Gestapo took away from him all the papers which he needed as vouchers to settle the accounts. The persecutors seem to be more afraid of the persecuted than vice-versa.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N THE reminiscences of Dr. Fritz Roesch is found a gripping illustration of the words of Jesus that He is “the door of the sheep” (John 10:7). He tells of observing the life of a shepherd while traveling in South Algeria. The sheep stalls are merely open huts, enclosed with a low fence or surrounded with thorny or cactus bushes. At night the shepherd stretches himself out on the ground, across the entrance, and thus closes the ingress with his own body. He literally thus makes himself the door. Jesus manifestly had this illustration in mind when He at the same time called himself “the door of the sheep”, and “the good shepherd” who “giveth his life for the sheep”. At any rate, He interposed himself for His own sheep, and for their sakes suffered at the hands of thieves and robbers.

<p><span class="font8">(Translation from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Neues Wiener Abendblatt,</span><span class="font8"> Catholic newspaper of Vienna, Austria)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">R</span><span class="font10">OME, December 6,1935.—On the occasion of the publication of his decisions regarding the modalities of the coming consistory, the pope, we learn from a trustworthy source which is in close contact with the lobbies, remarked significantly: “Questo sara il Nostro ultimo con-cistorio.” (“This will be our last consistory.”) From this we may conclude that the pope does not intend to have the two seats remaining vacant in the holy board occupied even in later times. On the other hand, it is true that for some time the pope’s health has been less satisfactory and that it is influenced by ailments which are the natural consequences of his advanced age. The will of making provisions for a long time ahead has always determined the measures taken by the present pope. This intention is seen again in his comprehensive dispositions regarding the coming consistory, which were a surprise to all the ecclesiastical and political circles in Rome, since the pope, against the desires of a certain part of the Board of Cardinals, for months past was little inclined to confer the cardinalship to new princes of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore, the consistory called for the 16th and 19th of December will also be of particular importance for political reasons. . . . The number of cardinals will be increased from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">48 to 68, </span><span class="font10">so that but two seats will remain vacant. Only six of the new cardinalships have been conferred upon non-Italians. Therefore, the proportionate votes will be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">37 Italians against 31 foreigners.</span><span class="font10"> Even if the two vacant places were occupied by foreigners, this would not mean parity, to say nothing of a majority of the foreigners. The majority in the holy board is thus secured to the cardinals of Italian nationality and therefore also the tradition, that the new pope to be elected some time later be of Italian nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. . . With Father Boetto the Jesuits are again represented on the Board of Cardinals. With the death of the German cardinal they had had no seat. The fact that this seat has not been occupied again by a German ecclesiastical lord has caused ill-feeling in Germany, as well as the fact that Germany has been entirely overlooked in the present appointments of cardinals. . . . South America has now two representatives on the Board of Cardinals, one for Brazil and one for Argentina. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During recent weeks the relationship between the Vatican and the Italian Government has become most intimate. The clear attitude adopted by the Italian princes of the church in favor of the purposes of the Italian Government and the Italian nation in the East African conflict has essentially helped to this, yea, even decidedly influenced this development. Only a few months back the pope showed himself less friendly towards the position taken by Italy against Abyssinia [Ethiopia]. However, the Vatican has now taken into account the currents in the Italian episcopate. A great change of policy has now taken place in harmony with the views of the Italian cardinals and bishops. From the same source we learn that the Vatican has acquired big lots of shares of the electrification of the railway lines Rome-Florence and Rome-Naples (for one billion liras, it is claimed), and has transferred to the Italian Government part of its assets in foreign currencies and securities abroad. In all the Italian dioceses it is strongly recommended from the pulpits that the people patiently stand the war of sanctions and deliver their gold. Practically all the Italian bishops have already handed their golden neck-chains to the Italian Government. These are the exterior tokens of the now very intimate relationship between the Vatican and Italy. Less visible, but all the more important, is the fact that the Vatican has offered the Italian Government to support it diplomatically in all the capitals of Europe. A sure foundation for the continuity of this course of the Vatican will be the Italian majority in the Board of Cardinals as created by the appointment of 14 new Italian cardinals. This increases the political importance of the coming consistory beyond the limits of the church politics proper.</span></p>

This is especially interesting in view of the declaration of “Reverend Father” Harney, of the Paulist Fathers, that as soon as the Catholic “church” is strong enough in America it expects to launch out in the murder of Protestants in a wholesale manner.. Looks like the pot calling the kettle black. What the archbishop fears is a letup in the production of “Purgatory” victims ; what the women are interested in is not having more children than they can feed and clothe. Contraception is not murder except in the eyes of an ecclesiastic who is out for the shekels. Let no one suppose that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ever was or ever will be interested in the welfare of the common people. Look at what they didin Spain, Mexico, Central America, and South America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thto was the statement made by the Rev. Mr. Harney, a Paulist Father in St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, in New Brunswick, N. J., Friday evening. The Paulist Fathers have been conducting a mission for the. last three weeks tn that church. Last week the services were for the benefit of non-Cstho* lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A feature of last week's services was • &quot;question box.&quot; This question was road by Father Harney on Friday night:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Does the Catholic Church regard Protestants pH heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even with death if necessary?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Harney's answer was:—</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">does consider Pretestants heretics, in a way. A formal heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truths of God and the Cath, ©lie Church. No man. by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead others into sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">'•I do not doubt. If they were strong enough, that the Catholic people would hinder, even by death If ne^eesarj. the Spread of such errors through the people. And 1 say. rightly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;As human society'protects itself against the murderer and the mpn who proves a traitor tb the government, so the Church of God has the right to nmteet Itself. The Catholic Church never dreamed of punishing one who is materially a heretic—one who believes thing* to be true that ait not true— any more than a father would punish his child- who does wrong unintentionally. The history of the church bti been a history of toleration.</span></p>

This may be a sufficient explanation to some, but it is mighty interesting that this relatively young man died at just the opportune moment to throw New York city right back into the hands of the Tammany politicians, and those who know about the De Medicis will wonder just what happened to Mr. Deutsch.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>The Little “Red” Schoolhouse</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE little red schoolhouse, which has been the boast of America for so many years, is in danger of becoming red in more ways than one, that is, if the Chicago Council of Catholic Women are to be believed. They say, “We Catholic women are greatly concerned in seeing that the doctrines of atheism and communism do not infect the public schools attended by our children. We must see to it that patriotic teachers are hired to instruct them.” Oh, so? Somehow, to those who know the attitude of the Catholic Hierarchy to the public schools, this all sounds very fishy. A few years ago the pope very nearly consigned to <sup>£</sup>a very hot place’ all Catholic parents who did not send their children to parochial schools. In almost every city of any size the Catholic Hierarchy has established private schools to compete with the public schools, and has tried very hard to get hold of a good slice of public funds to run these definitely unAmerican schools. And now, good, easy-going</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360212_files/g_E_19360212-17.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:249pt;">
<p><span class="font8">Just a little further, ‘'Proty, ” and we shall attain to peace, tolerance and the brotherhood of man.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">American public, the Hierarchy is getting worried about the public school, oh, so terribly worried, because they see red! So what? Well, through its well-organized auxiliary of Catholic W’omen, it is going to see what can be done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Further, “Rev.” Eugene J. Callahan, of St. Gregory’s Roman Catholic church, says, “Children in their teens refuse to salute the flag of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font10"> country. It is a very bad sign, indeed, when children refuse to do </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">reverence</span><span class="font10"> to the flag that is the symbol of the history, the aspirations, the heroic deeds of our forefathers, the flag that men have died for.” The implication is that these children are “red”, whereas the so-called “Reverend” knows perfectly well that these children declined to devote themselves to a flag because they were and are devoted to Jehovah God, and could not compromise by saluting with cowardly mental reservations, as the Catholic Hierarchy teaches its subjects to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no danger of the schools’ becoming red through the refusal of honest teachers and pupils to divide their allegiance to Jehovah God, but there is a definite danger of their becoming “red” of a different shade, the scarlet of the impure religious aggregation that has so long defamed the name of Jehovah God by preaching one thing and practicing another and undermining all true morality, honor and decency.</span></p>

There is nothing strange about this. Everybody with any sense knows that if the popes had been for peace, and used their powers for peace ends, instead of political ends, there might have been no wars for the past fifteen hundred years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“This event proved to be quite a turnout. There was nothing else in the paper for two days. The bishop arrayed himself quite gorgeously in purple and scarlet, sat on a throne from 10:00 o ’clock to 1:00 accepting the adulation of the masses, hied himself with 350 chosen priests to a downtown hotel where he fared sumptuously until 5: 30 p.m., and listened to more applesauce [the lady spells ‘applause’ a little unusually] from these priests; after which he had the grace to say ‘Thank you’. A fine time was had by all, except perhaps the poor dupes who work in the packing houses and who clean offices at night, to pay for the fine show. Ambrose sent his blessing, and a personal representative; so look out, everybody. I wanted personally to attend the show, but all the choice seats were taken. From all indications I missed a swell performance. Oh, well, I suppose I can stand it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The part of the clipping of greatest interest to the ladies said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Below the canopy of the main altar, superimposed upon a background of gold and white, moved the assisting deacons, in their square-sleeved dalmatics. ... On the grand stairway, flanked by the papal tiara and the episcopal coats of arms and mitre, moved the figures of the surpliced altar boys, attending the assistants of the mass. The archbishops and bishops and monks in their elevated inclosure followed the mass with their missals, baring their zuchettos at the appropriate parts. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is not as bad as it sounds. A zuchetto, it should be explained, is a small round ecclesiastical skullcap. The pope has a white one; a cardinal, a red one; a bishop, a violet one; and the common or garden type of priest has to wear a black one until he gets so he can dress like the rest of the girls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Catholic, tells of the effect upon his mind when he read Dickens’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Child’s History of England,</span><span class="font10"> generally admitted to be the best history of that country ever written. It erased from his mind all ambition to go ahead and be a priest, as he had until then planned. He used to tell other Catholics that if the Catholic was the true church he could not see why it should wish to kill and torture other people not members. Their reply was that that was the way that God wanted it, and Suckle came to the conclusion if that was God’s way he would consider it more noble to go to hell along with the rest. That spirit of justice finally brought him the favor of God, and he now rejoices in the truth. He is of the opinion that the true reason why the Roman Catholic Hierarchy seized control of the movies is that many of Dickens’ works have been filmed and the Hierarchy doubted the wisdom of letting the people see on the screen what the priests not so long ago were doing in the way of pulling out fingernails, putting out eyes, etc., which they would see if all of his works were filmed.</span></p>

The Catholic Daughters, like all other Catholic bodies, are opposed to the public schools, but asked for a Federal law to compel all teachers to take the oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Also, they urged drastic punishment of the Communists, but they would vote 100 percent in favor of the grabbing of the country by the Jesuits and the inauguration of a condition where nobody but Catholics could get a job at all, or even live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE greatest foe of the United States Constitution, the one that has done most to undermine it, is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, whose teachings and purposes are to destroy all Protestants in the country as soon as they feel strong enough. It is therefore an interesting lesson in hypocrisy which comes from Chicago and states that a day in September was set apart in the Roman Catholic parochial schools of that city to specially mark “Constitution Day”. The Hierarchy is enraged beyond bounds that the United States Supreme Court turned down the pope’s NRA scheme because it was unconstitutional. Why is there now such desire to manifest loyalty to the Constitution?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By F. E. Smith (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N A conversation with one of the leading radio station managers in Los Angeles, a week ago, I was astonished to hear him say, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font10"> hate the very sight of clergymen coming into the station; they are always on the begging racket, asking for favors and free time they are not entitled to.” He stated that the church business was the rottenest racket he had ever contacted, and the whole bunch was more trouble than all the other sponsors put together. He continued, “A few weeks ago I had a very ugly experience with a high-class clergyman who carries on his racket at one of the fashionable Presbyterian churches. This concerns my own mother, who is 83 and not so strong mentally as she used to be. She is a devout member of this fashionable church and attends regularly. One Sunday the clergyman announced the collections were coming in very badly, and he would be glad to accept any jewelry, old gold or anything of value.&quot; This old lady, having given him all the money that her son allows her, took off two very valuable diamond rings and dropped them into the collection plate. When the son found out what she had done, he saw red, also several other colors. He went straight to the clergyman and demanded his mother’s rings to be returned. There was quite a hot time. The radio manager threatened to sue him in the courts for the return of the rings, and told him if he did not do so he would, broadcast his conduct all over California, until his church was split wide open, and would expose him as a prey on weak old women. He got the rings back pronto.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>Jobs for Reverend Arthur Edwards</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">R</span><span class="font10">ECENTLY the “Rev.” Arthur Edwards, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church of Union Grove, Wisconsin, unbosomed himself, and brought to view the inmost feelings of his heart, by stating as follows: “If I had the power I would send all of Jehovah’s witnesses out in the ocean in a boat and drop them overboard.” It’s too bad for Mr. Edwards to waste his great talents on the small village of Union Grove. He should go to larger fields, where the desires of his heart could be satisfied. For instance: He might go to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and apply to the Canonsburg school board for a job striking, beating, and choking the little children who because of their obedience to God’s law will not salute the flag. Or he might move to New Jersey and join the strongarm squads in thrusting Jehovah’s witnesses into jail for preaching the gospel without permission of the police. Hitler could well use one of his spirit to hunt down and beat Jehovah’s witnesses into insensibility. He can also go to the Devil and say, “Father (see John 8:44), you have had lots of experience murdering Jehovah’s witnesses. Let me learn your best methods, and give me a job.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>Creation and Vindication</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font10">EHOVAH is the Creator of heaven and earth, the great First Cause of all things visible and invisible. (Isaiah 45:18) When the earth was ordered for man, in the six creative days of Genesis, other creatures already in existence rejoiced. (Job 38:4,7) The angelic sons of God watched with interest this further manifestation of divine power and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All created things must and shall eventually bring honor to the Creator. Creatures who fail to reflect honor upon God shall be destroyed. —Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As originally constituted all things brought eloquent or silent praise to the great Author of creation. “God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.” (Genesis 1:31) All God’s work was perfect.—Deuteronomy 32:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Disobedience disturbed and destroyed the exquisite balance in the operation of creation, and in the earth we see today not the perfect work which God made in the beginning, but the dishonored works in which God temporarily endures dishonor. Ultimately the blight of sin and imperfection shall be removed and God’s name for ever vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God Jehovah is the eternal Rock, a God of faithfulness, just and right. (Deuteronomy 32:4) “God hath made man upright [right and true]; but they have sought out many inventions.” (Ecclesiastes 7: 29) We see today not the perfect creation which God Jehovah pronounced “very good”, but a “creation” that is “subject to vanity”, under “the bondage of corruption” and that “groaneth and travaileth in pain together”.—Romans 8: 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As originally constituted the earth and its inhabitants were in harmony with the heavenly creation, and in Eden, the garden of God, there was a protecting cherub, anointed to look after the interests of man. This cherub was perfect in his creation and in his ways. He was a glorious creation, combining in his person a beauty and splendor comparable to every precious stone and effulgent gem. He was on earth the representative of the courts of heaven. Jehovah set him so. (Ezekiel 28:13-15.) He was one of the “morning stars” that sang at the creation of the earth, and his name was Lucifer.—Isaiah 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The name Lucifer means “Day Star” or “Lightbearer”. His place in God’s universal realm or organization was one of honor and glory. But his great beauty and brightness led him in the way of unrighteousness. He became proud and meditated “a usurpation to be like God”. He said in his heart, “I will be like the Most High.”—Isaiah 14:13,14.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>Degeneration</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Lucifer began by various means to persuade others to follow his own rebellious course. He enticed Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit, and through her caused Adam to fall. By Adam’s disobedience “sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men”.—Romans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lucifer further led many angels to join him in his unrighteous course, and these became devils, that is, slanderers of God and all who are in harmony with God. He was thenceforth known as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Satan,</span><span class="font10"> which means “opposer”; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Devil, </span><span class="font10">meaning “slanderer”; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent,</span><span class="font10"> signifying “deceiver”; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon,</span><span class="font10"> which means “devourer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His course of action was in opposition to God and was furthered by slandering God, deceiving men and devouring those who would not yield to his influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On earth the state of things, which had been harmonious and pleasant, became the reverse. The lower animals, at one time subject to the will and the superior intelligence of man, became wild and intractable; while man, losing his power to control them, or abusing them, became the prey of his former subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Originally the animal creation was not carnivorous. They did not eat one another. God provided for them a herbivorous diet. “To every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth God had “given every green herb for food; and it was so”.—Genesis 1: 30, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was no thought of one creature’s eating another, nor yet of man’s eating flesh of beasts. The seed-yielding herbs and the fruit-bearing trees were the divinely provided food for perfect man, ample for his every need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was after disobedience had entered the world that the statement “Thou shalt eat the herb of the field” was made to Adam, indicating the degradation of man and the difficulties they would be likely to face in providing for their food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ground, of the uncultivated earth outside of Eden, was cursed on Adam’s account, blunging forth thorns and thistles and making it necessary for him to work laboriously in order to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">obtain the needed subsistence.—Genesis 3:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was not until after the flood that men were given permission to eat “every moving thing that liveth”. Thenceforth 'the fear and the dread’ of man was upon all the beasts of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, and upon the reptiles, (everything that creepeth upon the earth), and the fish of the sea.—Genesis 9: 2, 3 (see </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font10"> margin).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no indication here that man would have occasion to fear or defend himself against birds, beasts or reptiles. These would, it seems, avoid man rather than attack him, because of the fear and dread of him.—Genesis 9: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The wanton shedding of blood and the hunting of the wild beasts would have been quite unnecessary if men had observed the instructions of the Creator. But recklessness and willfulness led many to disregard the word of the Lord and to exalt before the Lord those men who became “mighty hunters”, among whom Nimrod was most prominent. Bloodshed became a common thing, and the fair creation of God was further degraded. The course of nature was perverted, so that many of the lower animals became wild and dangerous.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>God’s Name Reproached</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In this perverted course of things God’s name was reproached and His wisdom impugned, as well as His justice, love and power. Satan led men farther and farther from the way of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus men, having forgotten or failing to heed God’s Word, inquire, “How can God be love, and permit His creatures to cause as well as to endure so much of pain and distress as is everywhere in evidence ? How can it be true that God is just, when we see so much of injustice practiced in the world? Why is it that the stronger prey upon the weaker? Does it not seem that it is really a case of the survival of the fittest?” And do not the “fittest” seem to be those who are most ruthless and destructive ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rapacity of the brute creation is exceeded by men themselves. Oppressive and brutish men take advantage of their fellow men and devour them in effect, and, in some tribes, do so literally. Savages, perverted by a devilish “religion”, eat their foes, thinking thereby to gain their valor and other good qualities, and making for greater strength and prowess in battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The wrongs and woes of earth are charged to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font10">who is in no wise responsible for them. Satan has perverted creation by lying and deceit, inciting men by various means to follow an unrighteous and wicked course. The lower man sinks in degradation, the more ruthless and rapacious he becomes. More and more he descends to the level of the brute creation in his acts, and sometimes even in appearance.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>Doctrines of Devils</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Taking advantage of this state of things, the Devil and his angels point to the vicious and competitive trend of nature and frame the Goddishonoring </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">theory</span><span class="font10"> of evolution. This is a doctrine claiming for creatures a sort of selfcreative power, or ascribes to nature the works of creation, denying the Creator. Man is included with the brute creation as an “animal”, a classification which seems plausible to some because of the degraded state to which Satan has brought men. Man is said to have raised himself to his present “eminence” by his own “creative” efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Regardless of the absurdity of this irrational theory, it is forced upon the unsuspecting, not merely as a theory, but as if it were an established fact. Those who refuse to give it credence are branded as ignorant and stupid, while those who accept it and apply its principles in their own lives are esteemed as intelligent and progressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to this vicious theory men are entirely justified in preying one upon another. They are thereby commended for taking advantage of others, when their “superior intelligence” gives them the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Instead of working together, men are by this doctrine encouraged to fight and oppose one another. There is, according to this diabolical theory, nothing essentially wrong in so doing. Indeed, the confessed view of those thoroughly indoctrinated into this “catechism of demons” is that there is no real and authoritative standard of right and wrong, and what may be right for one is not necessarily right for another. The obvious end of the theory is chaos and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Claiming that there is a natural inequality among men Satan’s favorites say it is inevitable that -wealth should concentrate in the hands of the few. They suggest that “defectives” be segregated against reproduction, so that only the “fittest” may survive. Doubtless they themselves will be the judges as to who are fit to survive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark233"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>God Is Love</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In all this the commandments and purposes of Jehovah God are ignored and contravened, and His name reproached. “God is love,” say the Scriptures, and “[he] despiseth not any”. (1 John 4:8; Job 36:5) He commands His intelligent creatures to love Him and to love one another and thus make for the well-being of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the followers of Satan love only themselves and seek to use their fellow men for their own selfish profit. Pursuing this course of selfishness the mighty ones of the earth, who are mighty in wickedness, have concentrated into their own hands practically all the wealth of the world, leaving for others just enough to keep them alive as the servants and virtual slaves of the grasping few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only are the mighty ones of earth content to let many of their fellow men starve, but they conspire to involve them in wars in order to make additional gain, thus sacrificing the lives of millions for their own selfish ends. Governments are influenced to co-operate in these impious schemes, and the people are forced to acquiesce or suffer the consequences. But whether the people acquiesce or resist, they must suffer, and coercion is resorted to in order to bring them to terms.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark235"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>Coercion of the Devil</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Coercion is compelling another to do something against his will, and especially something which he considers to be wrong. Coercion is applied by the Devil and those who are his agents to anyone who in some way or other obstructs their unholy schemes or does not fall into line with their course of action. Threat or flattery, cajolery or intimidation, is brought to bear upon the individual to make him take a course which he believes would be displeasing to God. When all inducements fail, actual injury may be inflicted to bring him into line, and, as during the inquisition of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, torment and death are inflicted upon the unyielding and uncompromising ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is by means such as these, and by the de-ceivableness of unrighteousness, that the Devil has built up his world empire and its various divisions, to the reproach of Jehovah’s name. Satan has made it appear as if his course of selfishness were the right way and any other course of action foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By various schemes Satan has sought to make mankind forget their Creator. His favorite method has been to erect symbols, tokens, likenesses, images, emblems, etc., as objects of worship and devotion to which obeisance must be rendered by means of salutes or genuflections or other marks of honor or submission. In this way he causes men, almost unconsciously, to violate God’s first commandment, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me [besides me, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.].</span><span class="font10"> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I [Jehovah] thy God am a jealous God.”—Exodus 20: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Formalism, like coercion, is of the Devil. It is a manner of worship which may be performed without affecting the heart, mind, soul or powers of the individual. God commands His creatures to love Him with all the heart, mind, soul and strength. (Deuteronomy 6:5) Formalism makes no such demands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan uses formalism to fetter the mind and to override reason. In the formalistic religions, which are Devil religions, certain performances are taught in early childhood, almost from the cradle, and become a chain from which it is almost impossible to break loose in later life. Early impressions are used to bind the individual in all his acts as he grows older.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The truth makes free those who obtain it. Only worship which is offered in spirit and in truth is acceptable to God. (John 4:23; John 8:32) In vain is the worship observed that is based upon doctrines and commandments of men. (Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:7-9) God invites men to reason with Him. (Isaiah 1:18) He has given His Word for instruction and guidance to those who seek Him.—2 Timothy 3:15,16.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark237"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>New Heaven and New Earth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Both heaven and earth having been marred by the works of Satan, God has promised that He will vindicate His name by creation of a new heaven and a new earth. (Isaiah 65:17) This does not mean the literal destruction of the literal heavens and earth, but the end of the conditions that have existed both in the visible and in the invisible creation of God. The literal earth “abideth for ever”.—Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The unrighteous hordes of'Satan have constituted “the heavens” in their relation to the earth. Principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, have dominated the world. These are referred to as wicked spirits in heavenly places. (Ephesians 6:12) These heavens shall come to their end, and a new arrangement supplant them. ‘The heavens and the earth that are now are reserved unto fire against the day of judgment.’ (2 Peter 3: 7) Who constitute the new heavens, the new invisible ruling powers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christ, the faithful Son and Servant of the Most High is the chief of the heavens that God promised to establish. (Isaiah 51:16) With Him are the 144,000 faithful ones who have followed Him even unto death. Additionally there is a host of holy angels with Him in the new heavens, administering the new government’s affairs and preparing for the early defeat of Satan and his hosts, whose powers are waning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fire which will devour “the earth” and “heaven” is called ‘the fire of God’s jealousy’, by Zephaniah (3:8,9), who says, “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith [Jehovah], until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of [Jehovah], to serve him with one consent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A picture of the perfected earth is given us by Isaiah, in chapter 11, verses 6 to 9, of his prophecy. He says, “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">[Margin]</span><span class="font10"> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” In Hosea 2:18, we read, 'And I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: . . . and will make them to lie down safely.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the beginning the ground was cursed, and brought forth thistles and thorns. In the new earth which God creates there shall be no curse. “Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” —Isaiah 55:13, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So Jehovah’s name will be vindicated in His creation, which will reflect His wisdom, love, justice and power. All the things belonging to the “former heaven and earth” will have passed away, and will not be a painful memory, for God will wipe away all tears from all eyes. Satan and all his unholy associates, together with the organization they had built up, will be entirely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Men shall speak of the might of [Jehovah’s] terrible acts: . . . They shall abundantly utter the memory of [his] great goodness, and shall sing of [his] righteousness.”—Psalm 145: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“All thy works shall praise thee, 0 [Jehovah] ; and thy saints shall bless thee ” (Psalm 145:10) Jehovah’s name will be eternally vindicated and extolled. ________________</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">INCE the twelfth century it has been the teaching of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that every time a priest says mass, Almighty God, in the person of Jesus Christ, is compelled to leave His throne in heaven and come down to earth to be sacrificed afresh by the priest, and this despite the fact that according to the Scriptures Christ died once for all and that “Christ dieth no more”. Well, here is an account of happenings at Cleveland which says, “The pontifical mass celebrated this morning by the cardinal was the last of more than 1,000 performed within the walls of the public hall today.” The time when the cardinal celebrated this morning mass is not stated, but let it be supposed that it was at 11: 59 a.m. How many more than 1,000 were celebrated before that hour is not stated, but suppose there were, all together, 1,440 in the half day between midnight and noon. That would be one mass every thirty seconds. But it must be remembered that Cleveland is only one place in a single country, and at the same time the masses were being performed in Cleveland thousands of others were being performed all over the world, with the obvious result that Almighty God would have no time for anything else than respond to the demands of these priests that He come down and permit them to sacrifice Him all over again. The whole thing is so preposterous and so utterly blasphemous that it is perfectly apparent that only the Devil and his imps could keep up such a farce for so many centuries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>What You Get for $2</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N THESE times it is pretty hard to get hold of $2, all at one time, but if you have the $2 you can send it right along to '‘Father” Jerome, Mother House, Chicago, Ill., P. 0. Box “SS”, and here is what you get for it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 Gospel of St. John. These little books are nice to have. Gotten up in quantities, they ought to be worth around 1c each. This is the most valuable thing in the package.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 Memento of The Little Flower. This is a picture that has been touched to a relic; neither of them of the least value to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 Agnus Dei. This is a piece of wax “blessed” by the pope himself. Supposed to protect its possessor from evil, its value is nil, or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 Sacred Heart Badge. You have to get something for your money. This is part of what you get. Wear a badge and be of the simple-minded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 Blessed Palm. This is supposed to protect against temptation and evil spirits and to help you obtain temporal favors. If somebody gets your $2 he gets the temporal favor and you get the Sucker medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 St. Benedict Medal. If you wear this medal 'you don’t get sick’; but the sad part of it is that everybody that wears it dies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1 Miraculous Medal. 'Mary told them how to make that.’ Why should you be told the truth about it? It is hard enough to peddle them without.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1 Scapular Medal. If you don’t know what you get for wearing a scapular medal, why should you bother anyone to tell you? Be reasonable.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">1 St. Christopher Medal. This is to protect against automobile accidents and such. For instance, you get caught on a dirt road eight miles from a tilling station and suddenly find you have no gas. What do you do ? It is simple. You have no $2 any more; you spent that for junk. You just get out your pocketful of hardware (worth 4} cents) and wish you had some gas, and, lo, you have it. The place where you got it was somewhere in Chicago. Definitions (JFebsfer):</span></p>

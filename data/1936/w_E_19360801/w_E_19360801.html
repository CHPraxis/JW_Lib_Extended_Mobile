<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 4</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall he holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.”—Obad. 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the deliverer. David the beloved servant of God long ago </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">expressed the </span><span class="font4">heart sentiments of the remnant </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font4">on earth when he wrote: “I will love thee, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">0 Lord, </span><span class="font4">my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (Ps. IS: 1-3) Now Jehovah has builded up Zion, his capital organization, and placed Christ Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">great antitypical David, the Head and King thereof, upon the throne. Jehovah has appeared in his </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">glory, </span><span class="font4">and Ihe time is at hand when he will deliver </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font4">faithful people by the hand of Christ Jesus, his King and Vindicator. Before the battle of the ‘‘great day of God Almighty” ends, even the enemy shall be compelled to see that Jehovah’s favor is upon Zion. While the modern Edomites persecute God’s faithful people they hypocritically claim that deliverance of the people of the world shall be by the hand </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies. Declaring that the hypocritical clergy crowd shall come to an ignominious end, Jehovah says: ‘‘But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance [(/?.!’.) those that escape].” That shall take place when Psalm 102: 13-16 is fulfilled, declares the Lord; and that day has now come. Jehovah manifests his zeal for his organization and therefore speaks to his people, by his prophet Zechariah: ‘‘Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">her with great fury. Thus saith the Lord, I am </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">returned </span><span class="font4">unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, A city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The holy mountain [the kingdom of God].” (Zcch. 8:2, 3) ‘‘Christendom” and all the Devil’s organization are traveling swiftly in the rapids and soon will be crushed beyond recognition. Therefore this is the time when God’s message must be proclaimed by his faithful witnesses to those who are of good will towards Jehovah, that they may flee to the place of safety. “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">name of the Lord shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance [(Zf.V.) those that escape], as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.”—Joel 2: 32.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The promise is sure and certain that God’s faithful remnant shall be delivered from the oppressive organization of Satan and .shall fully enjoy the privileges of God’s organization. (Zcch. 2: 7; Isa. 4: 2-6; 10:20-22; 37:31, 32) Even now the modern Edomites behold the hand of the Lord over his faithful remnant, and this they lia\c seen since their murderous assault made upon God’s people during the World War. The complete unity of the faithful remnant, their determination and zeal to serve Jehovah God regardless of opposition, their united shout of loyalty and faithfulness to God and his kingdom that goes up throughout Ihe land, strike terror to the Edomites, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The faithful ones of the Lord in Germany and New Jersey </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">jc-</span><span class="font4">fuse to yield to the threats of their persecutors, and this fills the enemy with fear. There shall be no deliverance or escape for the modern Edomites and their allies.—Jcr. 25: 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Then says the Lord by his prophet: “There shall be holiness”; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(K.V.)</span><span class="font4"> “And it shall be holy.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">IMhcr-ham</span><span class="font4"> renders this part of the text in this manner: “In Mount Zion shall be a delivered remnant which shall be holy.” Clearly this text means that the faithful remnant, delivered from Satan’s crowd, will be holy and completely devoted to Jehovah and will render holiness unto the Lord. These faithful ones are holy, in having come clean from Babylon or Satan’s organization, and will be continually offering their sacrifice of praise to God and to his King. (Isa. 52: 11, 12; 2 Cor. G: 17, 18; 7: 1) The great Refiner and Purifier sees to it that the “delivered remnant” are made pure and holy and that they offer continually an offering in righteousness before the Lord. (See Malachi 3: 3, 4) The faithful ones will not be putting forward their own expression of “wisdom” with a view to attracting attention to themselves. They will be blind to everything save the kingdom interests. They will be entirely dependable, faithful and true</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">to the Lord, and any who fail </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">come up to that standard will not be permitted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">Zion. “And it shall come to pass', that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">Jerusalem, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font4">be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem.’’ (Isa. 4; 3) The faithful remnant are now easily discernible as they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font4">forward unselfishly to the service, always singing the praises of Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* It was the expressed will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God that Jacob should receive the birthright. “And the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Hath.)</span><span class="font4"> These possessions are in full accord with God's covenant, that is, according to the birthright which God declared Jacob should receive. The faithful remnant now on the earth arc the antitype of Jacob, that is, Jacob represented them; and this promise means restoration of the remnant to their rightful place in Jehovah’s organization and to full privileges </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">service and activity in God’s organization. The kingdom privileges arc taKen away from the clergy and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">“evil servant” and given to the faithful remnant to possess, because they are bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.—Matt. 21: 43; John 15: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the chief part of the visible enemy of God, and their allied clergy now conspire to destroy God’s nuinaiit and say: “Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.” (Ps. 83: 12) They have said and still say, “We will possess it,” that is, the kingdom (Ezek. 35: 10), but their efforts are even now completely failing. “Hut the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.” “And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">obey him.” (Dan. 7: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18, </span><span class="font4">27) The time when this taking possession of the kingdom comes to pass is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“in </span><span class="font4">the day of Jehovah”: “Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that, the saints possessed the kingdom.” (Dan. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">7: </span><span class="font4">22) Christ Jesus, the Head </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the house of the antitypical Jacob, is now enthroned, and his judgment proceeds, and he completely ousts the “squatters” who fraudulently claim to possess Ihe kingdom: “Ask of me, and I shall give thee </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">thy </span><span class="font4">possession.”—Ps. 2: 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘“The house of Jacob” particularly applies to the tribe of Judah, of which Christ Jesus is the Lion, the strong and mighty One, who shall completely annihilate the enemy. “And the house of Jacob shall be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and dee our them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken it.”—Obad. 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’“The house of Jacob,” as used in this verse, applies particularly to Judah, and “the house of Joseph” refers particularly to the ten tribes of which Ephraim, Joseph’s son's tribe, was the head. (1 Chron. 5:1, 2; Ezek. 37:16) Therefore the expressions in this part of the prophecy of Obadiah, “the house of Judah” and “the house of Joseph”, include and cover the entire 144,000 of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, and hence mean the entire body or members of Christ.—I’ev. 7: 4-8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Note now that the two houses named, that is, the house of Jacob and the house of Joseph, act in complete unity in the destruction of the enemy organization; and here the rendering of this text by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kothcr-ha»i</span><span class="font4"> is enlightening: “And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, with the house of Esau for stubble, so shall they kindle upon them and devour them, and there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau, For Yahweh [Jehovah] hath spoken.”—Obad. 18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">liolh.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Since the prophecy of Obadiah applies specifically to the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy, “the house of Esau,” as med m this text, clearly means the modern-day Edomites. Com-erning this same hypocritical crowd God says: “Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his [the enemy’s) fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning bke the burning of a tiro. And the light [Christ Jesus, the representative of Jehovah] of Israel shall be for a fire, ami his Holy One [Christ] for a flame; and it shall bum and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; and shall consume the glory of his iorest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as wh&lt;n a standardlyarer fainteth.” (Isa. 10: 16-18) Supporting this, another prophet of Jehovah says: “A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame buin-eth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.” (Joel 2: 3) Another prophet further supports this conclusion: “In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on tire right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.”—Zech. 12: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Today all that is left of organized religion is but stubble, ready to burn. The clergy now have but a “form of godliness”, and their hearts are turned entirely away from Jehovah and his kingdom: hence the Lord says: “And the house of Esau for stubble,” fit only to be consumed by the devastating fire. Jehovah puts it in the heart of his faithful people to now pray coneerning the modern Edomites the words expressed by the Psalm: “O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubhle before the wind. As the fire burn-eth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire.” (Ps. 83: 13, 14) Thus the Lord says what shall befall the Edomites and their allies: ‘‘For, behold, the day eometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that eometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”—Mal. 4: 1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> It </span><span class="font4">is written at Revelation 17: ‘‘And the ten </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">horns </span><span class="font4">which thou sawest, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will cat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God inclined their hearts to do his purpose, even to execute one purpose.”(Rev. 17: 16, 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ding.)</span><span class="font4"> Confirming this, Jehovah through his prophet says: ‘‘Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">seen; I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.” (Isa. 47: 3) Doubtless these prophecies apply to the complete destruction of the influence and power of the Hierarchy and their allied clergy among the rulers of the earth, when the Hierarchy and other clergy are fully disgraced and cast aside as wholly worthless. Note that in Obadiah’s prophecy the credit for the complete destruction of the house of Esau is not given to the ‘men of her confederacy’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(vs. </span><span class="font4">7), but, says the Lord: ‘‘and the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the home of Joseph a flame, . . . and they shall kindle in them [shall burn among them (fi’.V.)], and devour them.” (Ohad. 18) God lays his vengeance upon the Edomites by the hand of liis own power: ‘‘And 1 will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger, and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.”—Ezek. 25: 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> In the war that is now in progress between the modern-day Edomites and the faithful servants of God the latter are now declaring Jehovah’s fiery judgments against the hypocritical Hierarchy or Edomites. Jehovah’s witnesses can bo obedient to God now only by continuously bearing his message before the people of the world ; his name and his Word must now be proclaimed far and wide. It is the Word of God in the mouth of these witnesses that is burning the clergy, even as his prophet foretold: “Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye [Jehovah’s faithful witnesses] speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.” (Jer. 5: 14) “But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.” (Amos 1: 12) As Jehovah used the heathen to perform certain parts of his purpose to inflict punishment upon backsliding Israel in olden times, so he now maneuvers the enemy and their allies that one part of the heathen will inflict punishment upon modern or unfaithful so-called “Israel” of the present day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy shall be completely destroyed; as it is written: “And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau.” (Vs. IS) “Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.” (Joel 3: 19) “Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the Lord, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.” (Jer. 49: 17,18; Isa. 34: 9-17; Ezek. 35: 1-9, 15; 25: 13) “The Lord hath spoken it”; and therefore all the “goats” shall be destroyed.—Alatt. 25: 46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah suffers or permits his enemies to take their own course until it is his due time to act, and when the due time arrives the enemy must be ousted. (Ps. 110: 1-3) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Edomites, for many years have wrongfully assumed possession of that which belongs to the true people of God. Concerning the ousting of the enemy and giving the possession to those to whom it rightfully belongs and who the Lord discloses shall have it, he says by his prophet Obadiah: “And they of the south shall possess the mount </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines; and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria; and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.”—Obad. 19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“ Judah occupied the south part of Palestine, which territory bordered all the land held by the Edomites. (Josh. 15: 1, 8, 10) When the Israelites were journey, ing from Egypt to Canaan Jehovah instructed Moses to command the people that they were not to meddle with the Edomites: “And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esan, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you; take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth, because I have given mount Heir unto Esau for a possession.” “And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned, and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.”—Dcut. 2: 4, 5, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1G</sup> It was not then God's due time to dispossess the Edomites. Likewise God has permitted the clergy to go on in their wrongful way without interruption until his due time to take action. The time to dispossess the modern Edomites is after Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, is enthroned and begins his reign. Since 1914 “the kingdoms of this world” rightfully belong to Jehovah God and his Christ, and Christ shall “reign for ever and ever”. (Rev. 11: 15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">It.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Christ Jesus, the rightful Ruler of the world, having come and begun his reign, the time is here for the fulfillment of the prophecy, to wit: “I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but* not nigh; there shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">come a </span><span class="font4">Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font4">of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his [Edom’s] enemies; and Israel [spiritual Israel, of which Christ Jesus is Head] shall do valiantly. Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.” —Num. 24: 17-19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> In proof further corroborating the above is the prophecy of Amos, which is quoted at Acts 15: 14-18. The Lord by his prophet Amos said: “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: that they [The Christ] may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doeth this.” (Amos 9: 11, 12) This verse, according to another translator, reads: “That they on whom my name hath been called [that is, Jehovah’s servant class, upon whom he bestows his name, and of which Christ Jesus is the Head] may take possession of the residue of Edom and of all the nations [the nations that are anti-God and anti-Kingdom], dcclareth Jehovah, who cxeeuteth this.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The time when this prophecy is fulfilled is definitely fixed, and the proof shows that it takes place after Christ Jesus is enthroned and begins his reign. “God at the first did visit the Gentiles [nations], to take out of them a people for his name,” says the apostle, quoting from the prophecy. This work of taking out a people for his name is not completed until the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the gathering unto himself of those who form the royal house. “And to this agree the words of the prophets [particularly Amos and Obadiah]: as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David.”—Acts 15: 14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> The taking possession of Edom, which means the ousting of the modern Edomites, the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy, takes place when the Lord is at the temple for judgment and after he brings unto himself the temple company. The taking possession of the modern Edomites by the Lord Jesus Christ was foreshadowed when King David brought Edom into subjection to the typical kingdom of God. The taking possession of the Edomites and all nations means the breaking of them in pieces, as stated by the psalmist: “Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (J’s. 2: 8, 9) The modern Edomites have exercised power over many peoples of the earth, but all of those who forsake that wicked organization and turn to the Lord and seek righteousness and meekness will come under the influence, power and control of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, the Greater David, and will be in line for the blessings which Jehovah promises through Abraham.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> All the nations must bow down and become subject to Christ, and only the obedient shall live. Therefore says the prophet: “And they of the plain [lowland (K.E.)] [shall possess the land of] the Philistines.” They of the plain or lowland, called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Shephelah </span><span class="font4">(Hebrew), are the spiritual Israelites, the children of Jacob. That country of the ancient Israelites after the flesh was contiguous with the country of the Philistines and was subdued by David. (2 Sam. 8: 11, 12) “The plain,” or maritime slopes of Philistia, merged into the plain of Sharon on the north. Speaking prophetically of the spiritual seed of Jacob, the Lord says: “And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.”—Isa. 65: 9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The Philistines were allies of Edom, and both of these peoples arc employed in the prophecy to foretell the Koman Catholic Hierarchy and those other clergy who walk with the Hierarchy in this day. Jehovah by his prophet declares his purpose to destroy all those enemies: “and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah.” (Zeph. 2: 4-7) It is thus made clearly to appear by the Word of the Lord that the Koman Catholic Hierarchy and all allied clergy guilty of persecuting and vexing God’s people shall be completely dispossessed. This will mark the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham, to wit: “That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.”—Gen. 22: 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Concerning others of the royal house the prophet Obadiah says: “And they [the rest of Judah, 1he royal tribe] shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria.” In the type that would take in the territory of the ten tribes of Israel, who seceded from Judah after the son of Solomon ascended the throne of the twelve tribes. That would mean that the Ephraimite and the Samaritan hybrids, who afterwards occupied that territory, must be cleared out or willingly come under God’s kingdom through his royal Son Christ Jesus. All the territory promised to the seed of Abraham, according to the covenant, must come under the rule of Christ Jesus. This is also shown by the prophecy which reads: “Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.”—Isa. 55: 3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Continuing, the prophet Obadiah says: ‘‘And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.” The tribe of Benjamin was the only tribe that faithfully stood by and clung to Judah, the royal tribe. The tribe of Benjamin went into captivity with the royal tribe and returned to Zion with it. The tribe of Benjamin represents those who are dedicated to the interests of God’s kingdom like as the tribe of Judah was. They foreshadowed the ones that are dependable and remain true and faithful to the Lord. The name ‘‘Gilead” means strong roek, heap of witnesses. That was the territory lying east of the Jordan river and was occupied by the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, it being suitable for their purposes as cattle raisers. (Num. 32: 1-5; Dent. 3: 12-16) Benjamin comes into possession of this land, and this prophetically pictures the blessings Jehovah bestows upon those who arc faithfully devoted to the interests of God’s kingdom, and who share in the ‘‘sure mercies of David”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> The prophetic pictures seem clearly to show that Jehovah first brings into disgrace and shame the antitypical Edomites, the clergy, and then drives them completely out of their possession long occupied by them, and then'Clears out all enemies of God and brings the entire earth and all the people who continue thereon completely under the control and rule of the royal house, the Christ. ‘‘And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that [that is, the territory] of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.”—Obad. 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> This is exactly in harmony with the terms of the Abrahamic covenant: ‘‘And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.” The Canaanites were enemies of God and of his people. Zarephath was a Phoenician town between Tyre and Zidon and well known as the place where Elijah lodged with the widow and her son during the three and one-half years of the drouth in Israel.—1 Ki. 17: 9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Looking now to the fulfillment of the prophecy: The host of spiritual Israel was in captivity to Satan’s organization, that is, Babylon, prior to and in 1918. Up to that lime they had even recognized the rulers of this world, the servants of Satan, as the ‘‘higher powers”. This they did ignorantly, of course, but remained faithful and true to Jehovah. The promise is that these faithful ones shall possess the place wrongfully occupied by those who oppressed them. It is a picture of how God takes careful note of those who remain true and faithful to him and in due time delivers them and gives them a place of supremacy over their enemies and over his enemies. These truths the Lord without doubt is now permitting his people to understand that they may receive comfort and with patience pursue their work which he has assigned to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup>‘‘The captivity of Jerusalem,” as used by the prophet Obadiah, strongly implies that the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy begins sometime after 1918 and while the remnant are still on the earth and before their work on the earth is finished. ‘‘When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that drcam.” (Ps. 126: 1) When the remnant saw that they were free from the binding cords of Satan’s organization, free in Christ Jesus, and recognized God and Christ Jesus as the ‘‘Higher Powers”, to whom they must at all times be obedient, that was so refreshing it seemed like a dream, and many so said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Further concerning the remnant it is written: ‘‘Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing.” That was literally true when the remnant saw that Satan was east out of heaven, and that they had a work to do of praising and serving Jehovah God till Armageddon, when Satan and his hordes would bo destroyed. The Lord spoke to them, saying, ‘‘Rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell [therein]” (Rev. 12:12); and the remnant heard, understood and shouted for joy. They rejoiced because they saw that the main purpose of the Lord Jesus is to vindicate .Jehovah’s name, and now they had entered into the joy of the Lord, seeing that the. remnant has a part in the vindication of .Jehovah's name. Others among the nations, who observed the favor of the fjord upon the remnant, who are devoted to Jehovah, are shown by the psalmist to speak to one. another concerning the remnant, to wit: ‘•Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.” Many people of the world saw that God’s remnant had returned as it were from the dead after the World War and were going forth with greater zeal and earnestness than ever in witnessing to God’s kingdom, and thus they saw and remarked concerning God’s favor upon them. The faithful remnant now in the joy' of the Lord say amongst themselves: ‘‘The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.” For some time these faithful ones have been sowing in tears; but now the change has come, and, as it is written, ‘‘they that sow in tears shall reap in joy.” (Ps. 126: 1-5) It has been a time of ever-increasing joy to the faithful remnant since they have seen it is their privilege to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah's name. They have forgotten self, and the unselfish ones are the ones who are serving God and doing so because they love lum. This clearly seems to refer to the time mentioned by the apostle, who wrote: ‘‘Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.” (2 Thess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2: 1) “The Lord knoweth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font4">that are his. And, Let every one [henceforth] that naineth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.” (2 Tim. 2: 19) It shows that those faithful ones </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font4">widely dispersed or scattered and now they are gathered together unto the Lord.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> In this connection note now that Obadiah says concerning the “captivity” that they “shall possess the cities of the south”. This clearly implies the ousting of the enemy and the entrusting of the rulership to the faithful people </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Those whom the Lord found faithful at the time of the temple examination and judgment he said would be assigned to certain “cities”, which apparently means certain portions of his organization of the great and holy city. “Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.”—Luke 19: 16-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> Each one now in the Lord’s organization, and who appreciates that great privilege of knowing and serving Jehovah, realizes that “now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him” (1 Cor. 12: IS), and each one of such delights to fill, by the grace of the Lord, the place to which he is assigned. There is no envy or covetousness amongst those of pure heart. There is no respect of persons, but all are at unity in Christ and therefore one in action, to the glory of Jehovah. It appears, however, that some who mingle with the faithful anointed remnant for a time are covetous, having a desire to receive honor amongst men, and such ones seek to push themselves forward into what appears to them a more favorable position. That is entirely the wrong spirit and means that they are following a course of lawlessness, and the Lord declares he will gather such out of his kingdom. (Alatt. 13: 41) The angels of the Lord at his command do this ousting work, and these arc the angels who attend upon Christ Jesus at the temple (Matt. 25: 31) These angels doubtless perform in connection with and toward the people of God many things that they cannot see with their natural eyes or hear with their natural ears. We have the assurance that “the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him” (Ps. 34: 7), and which must mean that these angels under Christ Jesus’ command have a special interest in and oversight of the faithful servants of God on earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIVERERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> Jehovah has no pleasure in the wicked, not even in their death. “For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; neither shall evil dwell with thee.” (Ps. 5: 4) Furthermore it is written: “As I live, saith the Lord God, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.” (Ezek. 33: 11) The wicked are those who have had an opportunity to know and to serve Jehovah and have turned the other way, and such include the clergy and the “evil servant” class; and concerning all such wicked it is written: “If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.”—Ileb. 10: 38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> The prophecy of Obadiah is devoted almost exclusively to God’s purpose and manner of punishing the wicked religionists. Not that God has pleasure in such a thing, but that he must make known his purpose to vindicate his name and reveal to his creatures the only way whereby they may obtain life everlasting. Jehovah takes pleasure in the vindication &lt;&nbsp;f his name and in the blessing of those who are loyal and faithful to him and who have a part in the vind<sup>:</sup>-cation of his name. “Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause; yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.”—Ps. 35: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> God’s due time has come to show his favor to his organization; and hence it is written: “Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.” (Ps. 102: 13) When Jehovah sent Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment, that marked the time of the beginning of the showing of his favor to Zion. He takes pleasine in those who have remained true to him; says his prophetic word: “The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.” (Ps. 147: 11) “For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation.”—1’s. 1-19: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The people of all nations who do survive and live must in due time hear the truth and pul themselves on the side of Jehovah. (Rev. 15: 4) Information concerning the destruction of the enemy is now given to the remnant in advance of the coining to pa'-s of those events that the remnant may be strong in hope and may well understand that their persecution by the enemy is permitted by the Lord to test them, and that in due time Jehovah will completely deliver them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> For many centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergymen have been browbeating, frightening, coercing and oppressing the people, and at the same time telling the people a great mass of lies, while at the same time they have been posing as the saviors of the people, and hence as their spiritual guides. By their use of fraud and deceit Ihc clergy have induced credulous people to support them, and now their preying upon the people is at an end. While the clergy form a part of Satan’s organization, yet the prophecy of Obadiah is limited to the religionists of the Devil’s organization so far as the execution of God’s wrath against them is concerned. When David was put on the typical throne of God’s kingdom he found it necessary to engage in war with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">enemy </span><span class="font4">round about, including the Edomites. When the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Greater </span><span class="font4">David was enthroned in 1914 and sent forth by Jehovah to rule midst his enemies he engaged in war with the enemies of God. All the evidence points to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fact that </span><span class="font4">the day of the fulfillment of Obadiah’s proph</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ecy is </span><span class="font4">now here. While the clergy pose before the people as saviors or deliverers, the real saviors provided by Jehovah appear, as it is written: “And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord’s. ’ ’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—Obad. 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> In ancient Israel the judges were called “deliver</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ers”, and </span><span class="font4">the word “saviours” here used by the prophet Obadiah means “deliverers” also. The words “saviours” and “deliverers” mean the same thing: “Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heard-est them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.”—Nch. 9: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>87</sup> When Israel was oppressed by the enemy and the oppressed people cried unto the Lord, he sent them </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">deliverer or savior: “And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font4">Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger broth</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">er. And </span><span class="font4">the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war; and the Lord delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.” (Judg. 3: 9, 10) “And the Lord gave Israel </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">saviour, so that they went out. from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.” (2 Ki. 13: 5) Speaking of Gideon’s band of warriors, Jehovah said </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">him: “By the three hundred men that lapped will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">save you, and deliver the Midianitcs into thine hand; and let all the other people go every man unto his [own house].”—Judg. 7: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>88</sup> In </span><span class="font4">the prophecy of Obadiah under consideration </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">prophet calls these deliverers “saviours” because they represent the Great Savior, Jehovah, and are directly associated with Christ Jesus, the Savior of the world, and through whom Jehovah accomplishes salvation of those who love and serve him. The term “saviour”, as used in the prophecy, therefore proper</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ly </span><span class="font4">applies to and includes Jehovah’s remnant now </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">the earth, just as certainly and as fully as it applied to human creatures whom Jehovah used to deliver </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Israelites of old.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>89</sup> The Lord uses the faithful members of his body </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">his work and counts what is done to them as unto himself. Today at the command of Jehovah the remnant </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font4">forth and ‘publish salvation’, which God provides and which is the only salvation for any creature. (Isa. 52: 7) To the prisoner class the witnesses of Jehovah now bear his message of deliverance to the people, that those prisoners, the persons of good will, may know and find the only way of salvation. (Isa. 49: 9) The true and faithful remnant watch out for the interests of their brethren and co-operate faithfully with each other in safeguarding the kingdom interests. (1 Tim. 4: 1G; Jas. 5: 20) It is the remnant, the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, that take the lead over the highway and lift high the standard of Jehovah, pointing those people of good will to the way of salvation. (Isa. 55: 4; 62: 10) All this the remnant do under the command and leadership of Christ Jesus, the Savior, and hence they are included in the term “saviours” mentioned by the prophet Obadiah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> These “saviours” “come up on mount Zion”, that is, the organization of Jehovah, and concerning that organization it is written: “Jerusalem is budded as a city that is compact together; whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.” —Ps. 122: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> This takes place when Jehovah builds up Zion, the building up of which began with the coming of the Lord Jesus, the great Judge and Savior, to the temple. Not every one who says, “Lord, Lord,” shall be of Zion, but only those who lawfully and faithfully do the will of God. By his prophet, the psalmist, Jehovah shows that there is a specific qualification that must be had by all who come up to the position of “saviours”, as mentioned by the prophet, and that qualification is set forth in these words: “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. In whose eyes a vile person is con-t'mined; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. lie that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 1!&lt;* that Dulteth not out his money to usury, nor tak&lt; th reward against tlie innocent. lie that doetli tin sc things shall never be moved.”—Psahn 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> These faithful ones who meet the divine requirements see and appreciate the presence of the Lord at the temple, and they hear and obey the prophecy, to wit: “Rejoice greatly, 0 daughter of Zion; ... behold, thy King cometh unto thee; he is just [the great Judge], and having salvation.” (Zech. 9: 9) The picture by the prophecy of Obadiah of the ‘saviors coming up on Mount Zion’ corresponds exactly with the picture recorded at Revelation 14: 1, and which shows the 144,000 with Christ Jesus the Savior on Mount Zion. All these scriptures disclose the fact that salvation is from Jehovah and comes solely through the channel of his provision, which is his official family Zion, and that salvation comes not from any of the clergy crowd, such as the hypocritical Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Jehovah God has provided salvation, and there is no other name through which it comes save that of Christ Jesus. It was to this very day the prophet looked forward when he recorded these words: “Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.’’—Ps. 14: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> What is the work assigned to these saviors that come up on Mount Zion? The prophet answers: “To judge the mount of Esau.’’ This, of course, means that those of Zion, the remnant, pronounce the judgments of God, which he has previously written and which judgments mark and condemn to destruction the hypocritical religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her allied clergy. It is the declaration of the vengeance of Jehovah God against the hypocrites which the remnant are commissioned to declare. God caused his prophet Io write concerning this very time: “Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of Cod be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fitters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written; this honour have ail his saints. Praise ye the Lord.’’ —Ps. 1-19: 5-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">** The pronouncing of these judgments of Jehovah against the scornful men, the Ilieraiehy and their allied clergy, necessarily provokes a war, because it exposes the frauds and hyp icrisy of that wicked crowd. Jehovah's witnesses are now engaged in the declaration of the divine judgments,- proclaiming the Scriptures that make known that (rod's time is at hand when he takes account with his enemies, in which he executes those who have defamed his name. They-will be declaring the Scriptures and making known that many of the remnant will be on earth and see Christ Jesus execute the judgments of Jehovah against the religionists and others who have so wickedly defamed Jehovah's name. Before the Lord Jesus Christ all nations are now gathered (Matt. 25: 31, 32), and this particularly applies to the religionists of “Christendom’’ and is clearly in line with the prophecy written, to wit: “Let the heathen be wakened, and conic up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom [Esau] shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because the)’ have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed; for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.”—Joel 3: 12, 19-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> By his prophet Jeremiah Jehovah supports this conclusion concerning the fall of the Edomites: “Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. . . . Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the 1 ■ blt.d'rn of the strong; but I will suddenly make him run y from her; and who is a chosen man, that 1 may appoint over her? for who is like me? and 1,1,0 will appoint me the time? and who is that shop: rd lar.t will stand before me? Thciefore hear the cuiriu! if the Lord, that he hath tab n against Edom; and 1 is purposes that he hath piu^o.cd against the b in.b-itants of Teman: Surely the least of the (Iori: :ball draw them out; surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. Behold, he shall come up and Uy as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bom.’h; and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of I.do a [Esau] be as the heart of a woman in h&lt; r pair,;.” (Jer. 49: 17, 19, 20, 22) The Edomites have b;ou&quot;ht great reproach upon the name of Jehovah, an 1 so the Lord will see to it that they do not go unpunismd. God will clear and vindicate his holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">'<sup>4&lt;i</sup> This clearing out of the Edomites takes place when the Lord builds up Zion: “And the kingdom shall be the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lobo's [so</span><span class="font4"> shall the kingdom belong unto Jehovah </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(/loth.)</span><span class="font4"> ].” Today the fraudulent crowd, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, claim to be ruling the world as the reprewntatives of the Lord, but that claim is wholly false and the Lord will see to it that it appears fab e in the eyes of the other elements that rule the earth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Iheir allies now </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.t</span><span class="font4"> .nine to 'reign as king without’ Jehovah’s royal bon ?, and contrary to the will of God. (1 Cor. 4:8) The commercial trafJekcrs and politicians, together with the clergy or religious allies, have set up the “abomination that maketh de .date” and claim that it rules the world by divine light; but that makeshift mu t soon pass away for ever. Salon’s organization must shortly end and a part of that ending shall be the destruction of the old “whore”. The destruction of the “old whore” system, and tl e literal cleaning out or killing of the men who mal.e up and rule that hypocritical organization, does not n&lt;e-essarily take place at one and the same lime. Rather does it appear from the Scriptures that the war now, which is in progress, against the clergy crowd will completely disgrace and bring into disrepute the Hierarchy and its religious allies, and then at the battle of the great day of God Almighty Christ Jesus will destroy all the wicked. This is not a dogmatic .statement or conclusion, but such seems to be reasonable in the light of the Scriptures and the facts. At any rate the part oi the remnant in that war is to sing the praises of Jehovah and to declare the day of h’s vengeance and make known his judgments heretofme written. By so doing they expose to view’ the refir e of lies behind which the wicked religionists have long concealed themselves; and then the Lord will do the destructive work. This is clearly and emphatically shown by other prophecies.—Ezekiel, chapters nine and ten.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> The remnant must now give close attention to 1 lie commission which the Lord has given them and perform that commission loj-ally and faithfully. Jehovah permits them to see his purpose in destroying the clergy and all of Satan’s organization, but it is not so important for the remnant to know just the order in which this will be done or the day when the destruction will take place. The remnant must be wholly obedient to the Lord, and, being obedient, they will not try to run ahead of the Lord and state how he is going to do it, a thing he has not revealed. The remnant must declare the message that Jehovah and Christ Jesus have placed in their mouth to declare, and not only be contented with so doing, but rejoice in that privilege. They must bear the fruits of the kingdom before the people; and the proclaiming of this message is to awaken those of good will, the Jonadabs, who form the “great multitude’’, as well as to give warning to others. This work must be completed before Armageddon because after the destructive work begins by the “Sword of Jehovah”, and with the angelic host accompanying Christ Jesus with their slaughter weapons, it will then be both too late for the remnant to declare the message and too late for the great multitude to receive the message and seek righteousness and meekness before God’s wrath falls upon the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> Let the people now understand the only means of salvation is that which God has provided through Christ Jesus. “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. . . . And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.” (Matt. 12: 18-21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">U.V.;</span><span class="font4"> Acts 4: 12) The Lord will rid the earth of the enemy and make it a fit place for honest creatures to live upon. “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.” —Zech. 14: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>49</sup> None of the hypocrites or of the wicked will survive, and all who do survive Annageddon, and all who are resurrected, must obey, if they live, and come completely under the rule of the Lord Jesus, the King of the earth. “All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord’s; and he is the governor among the nations.” (Ps. 22: 27, 28) Then Christ Jesus, the Greater David, will say to Jehovah, as it is written: “Thine, 0 Jehovah, are Greatness and Might, and Beauty and Victory and Majesty, nay! all in the heavens and in the earth; thine 0 Jehovah, is the kingdom, who art exalted above all, as chief; and riches and honour are from before thee, and thou art ruling over all, and in thy hand are power and might, and in thy hand it is, to give greatness and strength unto any.”—1 Chron. 29: 11, 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Both.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>60</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their clergy allies and all others who reproach and defame the name of Jehovah must and soon will be completely cleared out. Nothing shall be permitted to offend in all God’s holy kingdom. Jehovah will order and carry on his kingdom under Christ Jesus, his anointed One, the King and “righteous Branch”, agreeable to his promise made: “And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”—Jer. 23: 3, 5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>51</sup> Then is heard the great voice throughout the universe praising the Most High: “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder-ings, saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.” (Rev. 19: 6) Let all those now on the earth who love and serve Jehovah stand firm and steadfast for his name and his kingdom. Regardless of what the enemy may do, we know that the day of deliverance is near; and therefore the song of praise which his people now raise to the holy name of Jehovah shall go on for ever and ever to the honor and glory of the Alost High.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE MARCH TO ARMAGEDDON</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">D</span><span class="font4">ESCRIBING Satan’s marshaling of his forces for the coming fight of Armageddon, the prophet Nahum in symbolic terms says: “He [Satan] shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.” (Nah. 2:5) Satan’s “worthies” arc his foremost servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his preparation for the great battle Satan summons his nobles and the principal of his flock', and these “noble” clergymen and principal of the flock, hypocritically claiming to be Christians, hurry to obey the summons of their master, Satan, even as the prophet of God says they would do; and as they come “they stumble in their march”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> The prophet Isaiah (8:14) long ago said: “And be shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel; for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.” Even so, Satan’s “worthies” stumble over “the Stone”, which is God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. They make haste to the defense of Satan’s world or organization; and in so doing they scumble and fall, just as Jesus the great Prophet foretold they would, saying: “Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: . . . And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.” (Matt. 21:42-44) The prophet Isaiah (8:14,15) foretold this, saying: “And many among them shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stumble,</span><span class="font4"> and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.” They hasten to aid in the preparation for the assault upon God’s Anointed, but they fall, even as it is written; “When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to cat up my flesh, they </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stumbled</span><span class="font4"> and fell.”— Ps. 27:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet Nahum says: “They shall make haste to the wall thereof.” True to prophecy, the clergy and the principal of their flocks make haste to seek the instruments available for the persecution and punishment of those of God’s people who are known as “the remnant”, and who are diligent in spreading among the people the truth of Jehovah. They make haste to man the bulwarks of Satan’s organization, that the hated remnant may be destroyed. But while this preparation is going on, the clergy, or “nobles”, as the prophecy calls them, decline to appear in the open and defend their cause. Their policy is to never enter into an open discussion with those who represent God, because that would expose their duplicity to the people. Prophecy declares they arc “mighty men of Babylon” (Satan's organization), they being the religious part of the organization, and they swagger about and content themselves with boasting words, and secretly bring their influence to bear upon the political factors to torment God’s witnesses until the day the great battle will he fought.—Jer. 51: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan knows that shortly he must fight the Lord, and therefore he prepares for the conflict. His method of preparation, however, is that of darkness. By loud boasting, by exalting the virtues and achievements of men, and by putting tiie nations in fear of each other, he hastens the gathering of the people together for the great day of battle, lie is really keeping the men of his visible organization in the dark. Satan hates the remnant of God with a deadly hatred, and he incites his nobles and the principal of the flock to attempt their destruction. Doubtless Satan is confident that he can destroy the insignificant and, to him, “pestilential ” group in the coming battle, but he now attempts to torment and persecute them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan would completely destroy the remnant now, were it not for the protection God furnishes his own The prophet Nahum refers to Satan’s preparation and to his cohorts preparing for battle, and then savs; “And the defence shall be prepared.” These latter words manifestly refer to the protection God furnishes to his remnant. The word rendered “defence” appears in the alternative reading in tne margin of the Bible as “covering”, and means a covering or protection for those assaulting Satan’s organization. Tho </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> translation renders the text in these w'ord.s; “Yet the storming cover is prepared.” Jehovah God is the covering, and his protection for his own is “in the secret place of the Most High”, under the shadow of his wing; ‘he shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cover</span><span class="font4"> these with his feathers, and under his wings shall they trust.’—Ps. 91:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many centuries ago Jehovah sent Jonah to prophe-y against Nineveh, the capital city of Assyria, the same city against winch the prophet Nahum testified. </span><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font4">prophecy was given when Jonah had been </span><span class="font3">delivered </span><span class="font4">from the belly of the whale. The destruction of </span><span class="font3">the </span><span class="font4">city was deferred until the day of God’s </span><span class="font3">preparation </span><span class="font4">mentioned by the prophet Nahum (2: 3). Since J&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ was raised from the dead, which miracle was foretold by the deliverance of Jonah from the whale’s belly (Matt. 12:40), there has been given a testimony to the nations of the earth; and particularly has this testimony been given since the second coming of the Lord in these latter days and the heavenly resurrection of the faithful members of the body of Christ who had been sleeping in death. Now the testimony work is about complete. The day of Clod’s preparation is done. War upon and destruction of Satan’s organization is now about due. As the gates of the city, ancient Babylon, were opened and the army entered and the city fell, so, as the prophet Nahum (2: 6) says, “The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved,” and Satan’s organization shall fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The day of battle draws nigh. The day for the judgment of the, nations is at hand. The Lord is in his holy temple for judgment. Micah’s prophecy (1:2) declares: “Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is; and let the Lord G'od be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notice must be given to the world, because G'od does not take action in secret. Through his prophet (Joel 3:9,10,12) Jehovah says: “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Let the heathen be awakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat [the place and time for Jehovah to pronounce and execute judgment.! : for there will I sit. to judge all the heathen round about.” (Vs. 14) “Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan marches his great army into the “valley of decision” for war. With blaring bands of military music and flying banners his officers approach. In the van march the kings, the princes, the presidents, the governors, and the smaller political rulers; the judges and the attendants upon the great judicial systems; the parliaments, the congresses, and all others having to do with the political machinery of the world. More bands and banners, and on come the financial giants of the world, comparatively small in number, but great in power. More music, banners and floats, and then appear in the line of march the mighty ecclesiastical pontiffs, the bishops, the cardinals, the priests, the rabbis, the doctors of divinity, the right reverends and all the other clergy, each wearing an apparel that identifies him, and accompanied by lay leaders and those who serve and receive the collections. Proud, haughty, cold, calculating and severe, and with heavy dignity, each one of the three great governing factors of the visible part of the Devil’s organization takes its respective position in the bne of march. Self-importance is written upon their countenance, and self-praise is upon all lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">March! March! March! And on they come! In the line there arc great magazine owners and publishers, who use their columns to extol the virtues of the mighty worldly organization. There are the owners and publishers of the great .metropolitan newspapers, which mold public opinion in favor of the ruling heroes. More bands of music, and on come the chariots and horses of war. These are no part of the ruling factors, but they are instruments employed by the ruling factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Will they never cease to tramp? All the nations must come, because they must assemble to drink of that cup of wrath which God has poured for them, and none can refuse.— Jcr. 25:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There arc more than sixty nations that are putting forth their best endeavors to equip for war. Some idea of the number of poor souls that are prepared for the slaughter, and which form a military instrument of the Devil’s organization, may be gathered by anyone if he will consult the table of figures, published by the U.S. War Department, and which sets out the name of the country, the active army, the organized reserve, the unorganized reserve, and the total military manpower of each such country in the list. The total military man-power will be found to exceed one hundred and twenty-four million men. For all these men there must be war equipment, such as guns, swords, knives, knapsacks, gun carriages, tanks, ammunition, bombs, and all (fiber instruments of destruction used by men of war. Thon add to the above the tremendous navies of the countries, including torpedoes and numerous submarines. To this add the numerous aircraft that fly through the air and drop deadly missiles upon men. To this add poison gases, a comparatively small quantity of which would destroy a whole city in less than a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are all marching into “the valley of decision”, the mass of them ignorant of why they are going there. There are multitudes upon multitudes of people v, ho are no part of this organization, but who are either directly or indirectly affected thereby. These include the drivers of motors, the hospital corps, those who supply and convey the food necessary to feed the armies, the doctors and the nurses. And then there are other multitudes upon multitudes of people who are indirectly affected, because their necessities of life must be curtailed in order to supply the military organization. And then, over and above all this visible organization, unseen by all and known by a very few, rides the Devil, its mighty god, flanked and supported by hordes of evil angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of all this array of organized power, even some who claim to be Christians’ scorn the thought of a Devil’s organization. It might here be asked, Whose organization is it that is above described? Surely God does not need such; and while these come in the name of the Lord, they come hypocritically in his name, but in fact in the name of Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visible part of God’s organization is really small and insignificant, so small, in fact, as to hardly deserve notice. They arc on the other side of the valley of decision, under the banner of the Lord. They bear no weapons of warfare; only their trumpets do they have with which to sound the praises of Jehovah God. The visible members of Satan’s organization look upon this small and insignificant company of trumpeters with contempt. They are the only visible foes of Satan, and they refuse to compromise with any part of his organization. They persist in singing forth Jehovah’s praise and in declaring the wonders of liis works. Satan incites the clergy to destroy the little band of trumpeters, or singers, because the great ecclesiastics arc annoyed by the presence of and the noise made by this small company of witnesses. The little company is doing no harm to anyone; the politicians would find no occasion against them except for the influence of the ecclesiastics, and the financiers are too busy to give them any heed; but both must heed their ally’s demands, because Satan-is very mad at this little company and would destroy them. (Rev. 12:17) The Lord says to them: ‘Continue to sound your trumpets, cease not day or night, and fear not; no evil shall befall you; I have put my words in your mouth; tell it out that others may know that I am God. ’—Isa. 62: 6; 51:16; Ps. 91:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The power and military strength of the invisible part of God’s organization cannot be stated, because it is not revealed. Wc know that Jesus said that lie could call for twelve legions of angels for his own defense. We know, therefore, that there are angels of great power who form a part of God’s mighty organization. Christ Jesus is the Head of it, the Field Marshal leading the forces; and over and above it all rides the Almighty God. The power thereof may be approximated somewhat by the results that follow. Tnc great issue to be determined finally is, Who is the Almighty God? The day of decision is at hand, and those who have some knowledge of and faith in the Word of God arc now enabled to determine from the words of the prophets what shall be the result, namely, the deciding of the issue in favor of Jehovah God, an 1 the vindication of his name!</span></p>

Wonderful are the vvoiks of our great King that are done in this countiy. The viigins are continuously moving into the King's palace, following the bride, and they entirely clean themselves, in order to be woitliy to participate in the praises of the “King of eternity’’. They aie really coming with gieat joy and jubilation, wearing white robes and having palms in their hands. If you could only see them, it would widen your heart! Our heavenly Father is doing a work in this land! When it is completed, all you beyond the borders will make big eyes. Jie does not permit his faithful to be touched by the encmv, and preserves those completely who love him. Of course, they must use the sword of the spint and the shield of faith veiy often, in fact, all the time, because the fight against the evil spirits is getting hotter all the time; but Jchovali God is leading the fight, through his King, and so in reality we have only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to stand</span><span class="font3"> and behold our salvation. In the meantime we diligently use the trowel and build with cneigy. Jehovah covers everything up witii his wings. Yet we all must have faith like Abiahanr; otherwise all is in vain. By such faith have the faithful in this country caused mountains to move and hills to tremble; and while we are going forward, we are doing it with great thankfulness and deep humility. We know that Jehovah, our heavenly Father, will continue to bless us as he has done up to the present time.</span></p>

Thus the Lord is prepaiing his people for the final battle. While things on the outside are becoming mote and more confused and everything sputteis and roars, Jehovah steers his work serenely to its goal.

Eveiyone enjoyed these wonderful tiuths. Imine Lately after two horns a detective (police) was sent to come and take me to C.l.l).'s ofliee. I was taken away with a ciovvd of people standing around wishing to hear some mme recoids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sergeant questioned me what 1 was doing. I replied to him that I was playing these records explaining the tiuth vvlmh Jehovah’s witnesses aie telling the people, and that the people may hear what message Jehovah’s witnesses aie taking to the people. lie asked me who gave me a pennit to do so. I said, “The Scriptures.’’ He said he was going to chaige me foi interfering with the publie on the pavement. Then 1 told him that 1 was not interfering with anybody, nor was I in the way to prevent people to pass through. I said that the “Salvation Army’’ people always stand in the street ami sing ami peojde attend to them; you do not stop them nor clmige the..i for making a noise in town. After a long explanation they said,“You have not broken a law; theiefore we ate ju-.t telling you that wc sli-ill lind out tomorrow [meaning th-I3th of May, the day I am posting this letter to you], tln-.i vve shall let you know whether you shall be stopped.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yesterday evening I was in the B.S.A. police camp. I played the records and placed some booklets to a native seige.nil. They were very interested indeed. The machine I used this evening was lent to me by the native sergeant of the police camp. If they will allow me I will go to the police station arid play the records for them, as I wish them to hear also. Whatever they will say or do to me, I will boldly face it. I shall let you know what they w ill say tomorrow. Please remember me in all your prayers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH BRINGING FORTH THE GREAT MULTITUDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We feel it our duty to drop you a line for your encouragement, and we rejoice because we are in this field service with you. Here are some experiences which may give you joy to know:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have organized the friends here in the northern part of Ontario into a service campaign, getting eight into our automobile, and choosing our terntory from Fauquier to Kapuska-sing, which is solid Roman Catholic territory. This territory scatters for thnty miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We placed our vvoikeis out in sections of this territory, and covered it in one day, placing 45 books. We held two transcription meetings: one in the open, in a inrming settlement, and the other in Kapuskasing, at a Mr. Hoy’s house. There we put on the talk ‘ ‘ Scpai ating the Nations”, which went out fiom the housetop, and was heard for five or six blocks around the town, according to the chief of police, who said that we were awaking all the people of the town, therefore we were disturbing the peace. Ono thing we noticed was that we dis-tuibed the peace ot the priests, because we saw two standing about a block away; another, evidently with more ‘‘authority ”, listened to the lecture, and then went quickly to the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next thing we knew was that the chief of police was upstairs in the house fiom where we were sending the talk. We vveie very thankful that we were well on with the fourth record of that wonderful talk before he airived. lie at once endeavored to show his uuthoiity, and demanded that we stop at once, which wo flatly lefusecl to do. He then came over to the machine, and took the pickup oil the record. At this point I shoved him aside, and leplneed the pickup. Then he said he’d arrest if I did not stop. Jie was told to go ahead and do so. He then walked over to the window, and picked up the speaker out of the window. At this point I took the speaker under my aim and laid it out the window till the talk was finished. After stopping the machine we went through the usual jiro and con. We felt that we had gained a victory in the favor of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After our day’s wotk was over, which had stirred the community for thnty miles with the kingdom message, we were well repaid, because two carloads of French friends came to Sister Marleau’s that night, where we were staying. (They camo thirty miles.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was very unexpected. Their zeal was kindled because of the message they had heard go over that day. They came to hear more that night; but, owing to cutting a wire in our generator, it was impossible to use the transcription machine. Wo instead gave a talk on Revelation 7, explaining the ‘‘gieat multitude”, just as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> had related. We had to use our French brother to rnterpiet, because many in this group of 24 could not understand English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I do not know whether I have seen a gieater manifestation of happiness on the friends’ faces in my life. It was openly manifested that they had taken their stand on Jehovah’s side; and I believe this experience will give them boldness in declaring the kingdom message. It is quite manifest that this is the day that Jehovah is bunging forth the ‘‘great multitude” to his own honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We thank our God for this privilege of sei vice, and pray all tliat has been done has been done to his honor and gloiy. Tiuly, our fellowship is with Jesus Chnst, the True and Faithful Witness, in carrying forth the kingdon. message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Piaying the Lord’s blessing on you, dear Brother Rutherford, we are glad to colabor with you until the kingdom is set up in the earth. These are the names of those who had part in this experience [first three formerly French R C.J :</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">I am very thankful for your letter in rejily to my inquiry. I am detei mined, by His grace, to continue to take advantage of such opportunities as 1 have, to serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It gives me joy many a time when I am privileged by the Lord in having to stand liefote some of the world-rulers, representing the cause of the truth. I attach heieto a copy of some notes which, I think, might be of interest to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutheriord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thanks bo to Jehovah for the strength we have received from the ‘‘C and V” record. We wished you could be with us to enjoy some of the tin ills with the Sound Car No. 3. The Lord always sends things to us just when we need them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The jieople here in the South are very poor and have little or no money. But the sound car opens the way; and almost all of our books arc placed by use of the sound car. We also find that almost all the coloied preachers have some of the Watch Tower publications; and they me all falling in Imo by inviting us to put on our programs in their churches, some white as well as colored. We ine very glad to say there is very little opposition to our wotk here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Praise be to Jehovah for the trumpets he is using today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our love and prayers go with you till the victoiy be won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow jiublisheis in the kingdom woik,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">P.S. This incident may be of interest to you:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we first came heie we had difficulty in paiking tiailer; had ty pay ior paiking space. Then the Lord provided a goodwill (a service station man), who asked us to come and paik on his ground, and gave room for stoiage of books, furnished us with electricity for trailer and sound-car equipment, gas and oil for car nt cost, and other conveniences; and he askid us to put on the sound car every evening. He would pay the expense; he wanted to wake uj&gt; the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy was so mad that they sent a representative, a ‘ ‘ pi inci pal of the flock” (a woman), to tell him that he should not harbor a ciowd like that around, but should kick them out. He answered: ‘‘The Lord has not yet authorized me to do such a thing.” So wo are still getting the benefits.</span></p>

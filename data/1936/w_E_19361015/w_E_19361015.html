<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For the word of Jehovah is right; and all his work is done in faithfulness.”—Ps. 33: 4, Tl.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH works, and he requires that every creature whom he approves shall work, and such work must be done according to the will of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The perfect guide for the creature is God’s Word. It is important to know the will of God and then to do it, otherwise one could not work lawfully. Jehovah knew the end from the beginning, and at all times his work is according to his purpose. He says: “1 have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4G:</span><span class="font3"> 11) Jehovah has a due time for everything. ‘‘A time to keep silence, and a time to speak. ... A time of war, and a time of pence.” (Reel. 3:1-8) Jehovah completes one work and then proceeds to another, and likewise all his approved creatures must do, as he has commanded. The great purpose of Jehovah, as it is revealed to man, is the vindication of his holy name. Vindication is made necesary because of the defamation of his name brought about by the creature Lucifer, now Satan the Devil. To Satan Jehovah said: ‘‘But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my in.me throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lcescr) </span><span class="font3">In performing his purpose Jehovah exhibits his supreme power, and in connection therewith causes his witnesses to proclaim his name throughout the earth, thus giving them a part in his work. This emphatically means two things: a world-wide witness work to the name and purpose of Jehovah, to be followed by the battle of the great day of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has given expression to his purpose in plain phrase. He has caused prophetic dramas or pictures to be made emphasizing his purpose and making known the manner of carrying out his purpose. In his own due time Jehovah reveals to those who love and serve him the meaning of such prophetic illustrations as set forth in his Word. The Word of Jehovah is right and true, and is therefore the perfect guide for man. For this reason Jesus prayed to Jehovah on behalf of his true followers, that they might be fully approved by Jehovah: ‘‘Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.” (John 17:17-19) Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ, and therefore those who receive the gift of God must come to a knowledge of God and Christ Jesus: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou bast sent.” (John 17:3) These scriptures magnify the duty and obligation that is laid upon all who enter into a covenant to do the will of God. All such covenant-makers must work as commanded by the Lord God, who makes the covenants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Jesus announced the unchangeable rule when bo said: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work*.” (John 5:17) In the execution of his purpose Jehovah sent the man Jesus to earth. The first work of Jesus in carrying out the purpose of Jehovah was to proclaim the truth to those who would hear. Therefore Jesus said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause (,ime I into the world, tiiat 1 should bear witness unto tne truth. Every one that is of the truth beareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) That means that every creature who comes to a knowledge of the truth, and who receives God’s approval, must also pioelaim to all who will bear the truth of and concerning Jehovah and kis purpose. The entire matter is leading up to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus therefore is the perfect pattern or example set before men, and every person who faithfully follows that perfect pattern or example is caused to suffer because the wicked one, Satan the Devil, defames God’s name and attempts to heap disgrace and suffering upon all who faithfully serve God. No other condition is to be expected until the manifestation of Jehovah’s power resulting in the destruction of that wicked enemy. Jehovah performs his work, and Christ Jesus does his work, and every man who undertakes to obey God must do the work assigned to him. It is of very great importance that each one of us get this fact clearly in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The work to be performed by the followers of Christ Jesus is not the same at all times. One part of the work assigned is finished and then another is begun and carried on. It was and is so with Christ Jesus. He was engaged for three and one-half years in bringing testimony to the hearing of others as God had commanded, and, having obeyed the commandment of his Father, iie made report and said to bis Father: “I have finished the work which thou gaveit</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">me to do.” (Jolin 17:4) Jesus died as though he was a sinner, and his full obedience unto death according to his Father’s will resulted in providing the ransom price which opens the way for the salvation of men to life. Jehovah raised Jesus out of death and exalted him to the highest place, committing into his hand all power and authority in heaven and in earth, thereby making Jesus the executive officer of Jehovah to carry out fully the purpose of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMING AGAIN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> One work of Jesus being completed, he proceeds to another. While all his work relates to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, that work must be done orderly and at the proper stated time. For this reason, when Jesus ascended into heaven Jehovah commanded that Jesus should wait until the proper time to make the enemy Satan his footstool. (Ps. 110:1) That time related to the second coming of Christ. When on earth Jesus repeatedly told his disciples that he would come again, and he emphasized the importance of his coming. The great event to which the apostles looked forward was the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in power and gloiy. Their hope and expectation was not based on a cunningly devised fable, but they had the positive and unequivocal evidence that Christ Jesus would come in power and glory. So deeply concerned were the apostles about the coming of the Lord that they pressed upon him a request that he would tell them what would be the evidence of his coming, lie answered their question in prophetic phrase, which prophecy could not be understood and appreciated until its fulfillment began. In the inspired writings of the apostles that which stands out prominently is the fact of the coming and the kingdom of Jesus Christ. They fully appreciated the fact that a long period of time must elapse between the time of his ascension into heaven and the coming of Christ Jesus again as he promised.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANOTHER WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>c</sup> During the long period of time between the ascension of Christ Jesus into heaven and his second coming Jehovah performs another part of his work, to wit, the selecting of a people for his name, and which people must be wholly devoted to Jeliowih and to his kingdom. (1 Let. 2:!), JO) Having Iren instructed by the Lord, the apostle Peter declared to his brethren that ‘‘God at the first did visit the [nations], to take out of them a people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) This work is done to the end that in due time God would have a people on earth whom he would use as his witnesses to declare his name in all the earth, even as he had long prior thereto stated. For many years the faithful followers of Christ Jesus proclaimed the truth concerning the death and resurrection of the Lord and his coming again. In that period of time Christ Jesus was absent from his true followers; hut he did not leave them comfortless. They endured many hardships, persecutions, trials and sufferings, but, true to his promise, Christ Jesus prayed his Father for them, and Jehovah sent to them his holy spirit as a guide and comforter for them and for all after the days of the disciples who became the followers of Christ Jesus. The holy spirit must perform and has performed that office of a comforter and guide until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ; and when the time arrived for his coming and his gathering together unto himself of his faithful ones, he becomes their comforter and teacher and guide. (2 Thess. 2:1) There is then no further need for the office of the holy spirit as guide and comforter, for the reason that Christ Jesus with his own performs that duty directly. Before his coming and the gathering unto himself of his faithful ones at the temple Christ Jesus prepares the way before Jehovah by bringing to the attention of those who desire his coming many truths that had been hid and by drawing them to him and to his Fatlur. Such work of preparing the way before the Lord he finished, and then, true to Jehovah's promise, he comes straightway to the temple for the testing and judging of those whom he had thus gathered before him. ‘'Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall piepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to bis temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Mal. 3:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Now the midence produced by the Lord clmiily proves lxy mid all doubt that Jehovah clMhi mwd ('hri-1 Jesus as King m 1911 ami ■ ent him forth, as he .declares. to ‘lllle in i Lie nndsl of his &lt;&nbsp;m mms’. IBs. 110:2) Necessarily the cm my would be m ine at the time, and tlic facts prove beyond all doubt that he has been and is very active. That which came to p.os for three and one-half years immediately following the enthronement of Christ Jesus in 1914 w.is the fini-hiim work of prepaling the way before Jehovah. Those now brought to a knowledge of the truth and gathered before the Lord must submit to a test to dele -mine their sincerity and faithfulness. &quot;What is God's purpose in having Christ Jesus “come to his temple”? The temple of God means the true followers of and participants with Christ Jesus in the work' of cany mg out the purpose of Jehovah. ‘‘Know' ye not that ye arc the temple of God, and that the spii it of God dwelleth in you?” (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:16; Kev. 3:12) At the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ many’ had covenanted to do the will of God. Some of them were moved by a desire for self-gain, while others were unselfishly devoted to Jehovah, ready’ and willing to perform their covenant regardless of what they mieht receive at the hands of Jehovah. All of such spn ,t-begotten ones must now be put to the test, that their qualification and faithfulness to be the repre-enlaii.es of Goel and Christ on earth might be d'-tm mined. Therefore it is wiittcn of and concerning Chri.l Ji sn the ri eat Mc--cnger and Judge at the to. iple: *‘.'n I he .shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”—ISIal. 3: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The offerin'? unto the Lord in righteousness here mentioned is an unselfish and unstinted devotion to Jehovah God and his King, and which leads them to a joyftfl obedience to the commandments of the Lord. Bringing an offering in righteousness does not mean a qualified service to the Lord or any service having n selfish reason, The apostle defines that righteous offering in these words: ‘‘By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of .nri.ii.se to Clod continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well phased.” (TTeb. 13;15, 1G) The antitypical sons of Levi are all those who are in a covenant to do God’s will and who arc the spirit-begotfen sons of God, and at the temple judgment the land determines which of iln-&gt;e are qualified to represent the Lord in his kingdom. To the qualified representatives he commits his kingdom interests.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">’ From among those at the temple judgment is made manifest the ‘‘evil servant”, which class has been moved by a desire for selfish gain. The prospect of going to heaven and having a part in aiding the Lord to rule the universe has been the chief inducement for such to covenant to do the will of God and to enter his service. The Lord is no respecter of persons and does not arbitrarily determine who shall be his representatives and receive his blessings, but each one discloses Ids fitness or unfitness by reason of his heart condition and the course of action he takes. The faithful and unselfish ones, devoted to God, and who joyfully do his will, arc judged favorably and approved, and concerning such the Lord Jesus says: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat m due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” —Slatt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEIR WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The temple company has now become a part of the elect servant and is under the direct command of the Head of the servant class, Christ Jesus himself. The motive that induces them now to engage in the work must be love, that is, unselfishness, a willing and joyful devotion to God and to his King and kingdom. The King is on his throne; he is at the temple conducting judgment and instructing and directing those of the temple class. That is the beginning of the exercise of God’s power through Christ Jesus toward the world, and in behalf of his own people, and those of the temple must now become willing and are willing to do their work, and they do it joyfully, as it is written: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.”— Ps. 110:3. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ *</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The morning of the new day has come, and the light thereof discloses the beauty of holiness of the Lord, and those of the temple are like strong, vigorous young men going forth to battle. The Lord Jesus now discloses what must be the true motive that induces these faithful ones to work, when he says to them: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”—John 14:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Those of the temple are the ‘people taken out for his name’, that is to say, the selected and separated ones from the world who are set aside for the kingdom service. What work must they do? The commission of authority given them by Jehovah answers that question. Concerning the Lord Jesus it is written: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God ; to comfort all that mourn.”—Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Those who arc brought unto Christ and made a part of his organization receive the same anointing or commission of authority from Jehovah by their Head Christ Je.sus, and their work is thus defined. The work of these must be exactly in harmony with the spirit of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. To these commissioned ones the admoii'tion is given: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in jou both to will end to do of his good pleasure.” (Phil. 2:12-14) Jvhmali God is now<sup>r</sup> working to the end of vindicating h.- name, and he permits these faithful ones to woik with him according to his will and his good pleasing He does not need them, but he grants this privilege to them. It is the expressed will of God that his name shall he vindicated. It i-&gt; the pleasure of Goel that the temple company shall have a part in the vindication of his name. Jehovah i...s taken them out of the world as a people for h is name, and his will concerning them he expresses in these words: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my sc want whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he. . .. .Therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that lamGod”; ‘there is none beside me? (Isa. 43:10-12) Note this, that the Lord God says to his chosen ones: ‘You must receive knowledge; you most believe that such know! edge comes from God’s Word, and vou must understand your true relationship to the Lord.' It is written in his Word: “With all thy getting get understanding.”—Prov. 4:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> A person may know the texts of God’s Word and yet not he w’isc or have understanding. To ‘■get im-derstanding'<sup>,</sup>'means to know’ and to appreciate properly the relationship of the creature to the Creator, That means that we must know’ and appreciate that there is but one Almighty God. whose name alone is</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, who is supreme, the Most High above all, and from whom eomes every good and perfect gift; that Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s beloved Son, is next to the Father and is the “right hand” or chief officer of Jehovah, and that those who are in Christ, and therefore of the temple company, are the servants of God and Christ, and that the servant must do the will of his Master and do it joyfully. Such is ‘getting understanding</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Before a peison can become one of the ‘elect servant’ class he must sacrifice all worldly hopes and prospects and ambitions and become submissive to the will of God. Having once become a servant of God, it is even more important that the person who is the servant obey, and to such this rule is given: “To obey is bettor than sacrifice.” Going contrary to the will of God is rebellion. Negligence or refusing to obey instructions from the Lord is stubbornness and therefore lawlessness and a form of idolatry. (1 Sam. 15:22, 23) If one is brought to the temple of God and becomes a part of the temple and then fails or refuses to be willingly obedient to the law of God and his organization, such, as the Lord states, will be put out of the temple and therefore out of the kingdom. (Matt. 13:41) The servant must do what he is told to do by the Lord, and do it willingly and without complaint or murmuring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> How may the servant always know just what he must do? The Bible, which is the expressed Word of God, furnishes the answer and hence the complete guide. In proof of this it is written: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) “AU scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Tim. 3:16,17) The servant who is instructed in the Word of God is equipped for the good work to which he has been assigned. Being so instructed the servant must oliey; otherwise he could not receive the Lord's approval, but would lose everything. Christ Jesus is the Greater Moses, and concerning this present day, when Christ Jesus is at the temple instructing and directing the consecrated company and commanding them what to do, it is written for the benefit of the servant company: “And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">U.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The servant therefore has no discretion ; he must obey, and do it gladly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” Those creatures on earth known as the remnant, and who are of the anointed temple company, form a part of Zion, which is God’s organization, and they must work exactly in harmony with the Head of that organization, Christ Jesus. The Teachers of the temple company are Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and these perfect Teachers have provided the means for the temple company to be properly informed as to their duties and privileges. Therefore it is written: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Tim. 2:15) This does not mean to study carefully what may be advanced by other men, which to others might appear to be holy and sanctimonious. It means to study and to learn what is the will of God concerning his servant and then to work without embarrassment or shame because of that work, and to properly and rightly apply the truth. It is therefore necessary to constantly and consistently study God’s Word of truth and in so doing to use the helps which the Lord has provided for gaining a knowledge of the truth. It has been said that anyone who has agreed to do the will of God ean understand the truth, because ‘the truth is sown for the righteous’. That is not the proper statement, because it is a misquotation of the scripture ami an improper application thereof. The truth is the Word of God. But no one can gain an understanding of God’s truth until God’s due time, and then only those can understand it who diligently follow God’s announced rules. It is written: “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.”—Ps. 97:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Not everyone is righteous who claims to be serving the Lord. IIow does one become righteous? By a full consecration to the Lord, by being brought into the temple and under the “robe of righteousness” which Jehovah has provided for such and concerning which it is written: “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom deeketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorn-eth herself with her jewels.”—Isa, 61 :10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah’s light shines upon the Head of the temple company, Christ Jesus, and that light in his face is mirrored or reflected to those of the temple company, and by this means the temple company are permitted to have a knowledge and understanding of the revealed truths of God’s Word. (2 Cor. 3: IS) The light of Jehovah illuminates his prophecy, and through Christ Jesus he gives a knowledge and appreciation of that prophecy to those who are devoted to him. The facts show that God has been pleased to use the Watch Tower publications to publish and transmit the truth to and for the benefit of those who love him. the Lord Jesus at the temple, and accompanied by all his holy angels, has his own good way, in harmony with the will of God, to transmit that information and to make it understandable and appreciated by those who do love and serve him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah having enthroned his beloved Son the King and having sent him to the temple, a new' day has come. The glorious Day Star has arisen, and 11m time for the vindication of God’s name is at hand. It is the day which Jehovah has made and concerning which it is written: &quot;Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it.”—</span><span class="font3">1’s. 118:19-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> No longer is the holy spirit now performing the office of guide, teacher and comforter of God’s people, for the reason that Christ Jesus is the Teacher, Guide and Comforter and he is present and instructs and guides his own; and this therefore is a day of rejoicing. Christ Jesus has the special and great joy of doing the work now which he has had in his heart a long time to do. It is the day for the vindication of his Father's name, lie therefore invites those of the temple class to enter into his joy and participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It is no lunger a time of sorrow. The King has gathered his own unto himself, and these are &quot;caught up” in the invisible place to be for ever with the Lord.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3">Thess. 4:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">W A K</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> It is now a time of work and for war, because Satan the Devil will not give way to the rightful Ruler, Christ Jesus, and therefore Satan and his entire organization must be destroyed at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. For this reason there is a change of the work which must be performed by the servants of God. Formerly Christians believed that God’s objective is to take men to heaven, but now the servant class see that his purpose is to vindicate his name by destroying wickedness and establishing everlasting righteousness in all the univow and that only those who put themselves on the side of God and his kingdom will receive the benefits of God’s boundless blessings, including the gift of life at his gracious hands. What, then, is the proper undeistanding of the Scriptures as applied to this present time? In brief it is this: The kittle that soon is to be fought, and which is to for ever settle the question of supremacy and rulcrship of the world, is the battle of God Almighty, and the one who leads in that battle and gains the victory in the name of Jehovah is his great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and the duty of all of the temple company is now to obey the orders and instructions coming from the Lord, and so obeying they have a specific work to do. The Lord makes it clear that the part to he performed by the anointed remnant is to now sing the praises of Jehovah and his King, and to do so fearlessly and joyfully, regardless of all opposition. This is bringing an offering unto the Lord in righteousness. The prophecy of God written centuries ago, and now interpreted by the Lord, makes clear the duty of the temple company. There lias been an attempt to show that the battle of Armageddon and the battle of the great day of God xllmighty are two separate and distinct events. Manifestly such is a sly trick of the wily foe, the Devil, to bring confusion into the ranks of God's visible organization. The &quot;elective elder” class walk along or associate with the true servant class and can be easily used by the Devil to bring about sueh confusion, but the ‘elect servant’ class will not be deceived, because the Lord Jesus Christ so declares. &quot;Armageddon” means the place of the assembly of troops, that is to say, the troops of Jehovah of hosts. These, together with Christ Jesus, aie on Mount Zion, which is God’s organization. It is written, at Revelation 16, that the Devil and his aides go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and the Devil gathers his forces together unto a place called &quot;Armageddon”. The Devil and his associates or aides have conspired together to bring about the destruction of those on Ilie side of Jehovah and his King. In due time the battle will take place, and it is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, led by Christ Jesus; and all his armies in heaven follow after him; and the place where the battle is foimbt is called &quot;&nbsp;Ai mageddon”; the battle of the great day of God Almighty and that which is often spoken of as the ‘battle of Armageddon’ are one and the same.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RE.VNANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup>' The forces of Almighty God are assigned to a specific duty, which duty must be faithfully performed. Jehovah God through Christ Jesus anoints the temple company, which means that he commissions them to do a certain or specific work&quot;, and they ate sent, forth by their Head to do that work. The commission of authority bestowed upon the remnant provides that they must ‘declare the day of the vengeance (or vindication) of our God and comfort all that mourn’. Into the custody and keeping of this anointed servant class are committed the kingdom interests on earth. They are instructed that Christ Jesus is at the temple, conducting judgment, which judgment will shoitly be executed against the wicked. But before the execution of the wicked one and his organization a woik must be done by the anointed remnant. Therefore the Lord commands them in these words: &quot;And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the cm] come.” —Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Now the Lord has entrusted much to this anointv d servant class, and of them a larger amount will be demanded. They must perform their part, which is defined as proclaiming the good news of the kingdom to all who are of good will and who will hear. They must perform their part of this work before the final tribulation of Armageddon falls upon the enemy. The Lord has made and placed his anointed remnant in the position as watchmen and laid upon them the obligation to watch and io give warning to others, that others may learn of Jehovah and his purpose. To the watchman company the Lord assigns the work of proclaiming the name of Jehovah, his King and kingdom and to give warning to others. The watchman is plainly told that he must be diligent in informing himself of what he must do; must be on the alert and wide-awake, must be dependable and zealous, and must perform his duties with joy. The watchman receives instructions from the mouth of the Lord and gives the warning of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord, </span><span class="font3">and therefore the warning is the Lord's, and not that of man. The watchman must repeat what the Lord has given him to declare, lie sei's the day approaching when the sword of Jehovah shall fall disastrously upon the nations and the people, and he must sound the warning thereof. To the watchman, the servant class, the Lord therefore says: “When I say unto the wicked, 0 wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3">require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquitv; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”—Ezek. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">33: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> That means that the watchman must proclaim this gospel of the kingdom and that the gospel of the kingdom will be a comfort and aid to those who desiie to be comforted, and that the watchman must declais the day of the vengeance of our God, and he must do so willingly and zealously, and any failure or refusal on his part to obey means the destruction of the watchman or whoever thereof does fail or refuse. It is the commandment of the Lord and must be obeyed. (Acts 3:23) Such is the work assigned to the servant class, and which must be done by Jehovah’s witnesses as preparation for the great battle progresses. The remnant therefore have a part in this war-work, but they do not fight with carnal weapons. Their weapons of warfare are the message of God’s truth, and that is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">mighty weapon for the shaking of the foundations of the enemy’s visible organization even in this day. Satan and his forces now make war on the remnant, because to the remnant the kingdom interests have been entrusted and the remnant are declaring that message of truth to the people, and thus draw the fire of the enemy upon them. (Rev. 12:17) That is the reason for the wicked persecutions now inflicted upon the remnant by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their tools. Regardless of that persecution, however, the anointed must continue and will continue to obey the Lord. The course taken by the faithful remnant is a warning to others, and the persecution of them affords the opportunity for the remnant to prove their own integrity toward God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT MULTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Who are those that “mourn”, as described in the Scriptures, and who Johor ah declares mmt receive comfort from the message delivered to them by his anointed witnesses'? Manifestly those are the ones who will compose the “great multitude”, otherwise designated in tire Scriptures as Jonadabs. God’s time is here for the ingathering of the great multitude. Do those of the remnant, that is, the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, gather the great multitude? Certainly not. It is important to have a proper understanding nr this regard, that is, to know and to appreciate our relationship to God and his kingdom and our work in connection therewith. No man ever gathered another man into the kingdom of God. Appreciating this truth, the apostle wrote: “I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So their neither is he that plantcth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”—1 Cor. 3: G, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> It is the Lord who gathers the great multitude. The Lord uses the term “sheep” to illustrate tho-e gathered to him and made members of the royal home of Jehovah. Then Jesus adds: “And other sheep 1 Lave, which arc not of this fold; them also I must, bring, and they’ shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John JO: 1G) The great multitude are those of the “other sheep” whom the Lord gathers into his organization, and in due time all those gathered become a part of the fold of the Shepherd, Christ Jesus. The work of the remnant in connection with the great multitude is to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom, testifying to the name an 1 purpose of Jehovah by and througli his King, and to point out that the kingdom of God under Christ rs the only hope for mankind. That message brings comfort to those who sigh ami mourn because of unrightcou,-ness committed about them and because of their desire to sec and to follow righteousness. The duty and obligation laid upon the servant class is to show' the people of good will the way to (tod’s organization, th-.t they may flee to it and there find the place of safety.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SALVATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> There is no possible means of Salvation Io life save that which God has provided through Christ Jesus. (Acts 4:12) The Lord has laid the obligation upon his anointed remnant to tell the people that very important truth, and to tell it to them now'. There i&gt; no dodging or side-stepping that responsibility. It is equally true that the people now on earth who hear the message concerning God and his kingdom, and wiio reject it and turn away therefrom, such rejecters shall not survive Armageddon. Seeing this fact we can have some appreciation of the declaration by the prophet Jeremiah that at the conclusion of Armageddon tlure will be so many dead that the survivors cannot bury them. (Jer. 25:33; The obligation of informing tne people of good w’ill concerning God's provision for their salvation is laid upon the anointed remnant ; s a whole. No one can perform the work that is assigned to another. Each one must, do his own part as opp'W-tunily is given to him. Some seem to have reached the conclusion that a certain great work must be done by some particular individual of the remnant company, and that therefore among the remnant there are some great men who will do that work. That conclusion is entirely without support in the Scriptures. On the contrary, the Scriptures, and particularly the prophecy of Obadiah, disclose that no individuals are identified as members of the temple. All of the temple class or the remnant are on a nar or common level. There are none miuhlv and meat or specially important. All are serxants of the Lord. There is no occasion lor anvone Io boast ot 1ns importance or atlemnt to induce himself to believe that he is to do and pcr-lorm some wonderlul and unusual work. The duty of oa&lt;'h one is to obey the commandments of the Lord and to give all honor and glory to the Lord and not any to man. NoiiO of the <sup>e</sup>elect servant’ class in this day Mill be guilty of the “sin of Samaria’’, that is, gix mg honor and glory to other than the Lord. Tf some insist on taking honor and glory to themselves, or on giving it to per ons, that is very persuasive evidence tiiat such ones are not of God’s elect servant’ class.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2 ,1</sup> When shall the remnant do their service as commanded in giving warning and comfort to those of good will and who will go to make up the great multitude? Will there be a greater and more favorable opportunity to do sueb work after Armageddon? The work of bearing the message of the kingdom to the great multitude must be done before, and not after, Armageddon. Those of good will who will form the great multitude must the to the “city of refuge” before, and not after, Armageddon. Today is the acceptable time when the Lord brings the message Io the people, and this he does before vengeance is visited upon Satan’s organization. Manifestly the effort of the Devil is to induce men to believe that after Armageddon will be the time for the work of the gathering of the great multitude.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The ‘elect servant’ class will not be deceived or induced to become negligent by reason of the efforts of the wily foe, but now they will give diligence to obey the commandments of the Lord. Some scriptures bearing upon the time for informing the great multitude are here briefly mentioned and conclusively settle the question that the testimony to the great multitude must be delivered before Armageddon, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> At Ezekiel the ninth chapter the Lord records a prophetic drama which is a direct authority on this point. There the man clothed with linen, with the writer's inkhorn by his side, plays the part representing Jehovah’s witnesses, who are commissioned to do his work. Those of the prophecy who sigh and cry picture the people of good will, who desire to be rid of the abominations committed by religionists; while the six men v. ith slaughter weapons picture the forces of the Lord which do the slaying work at Armageddon. The command of the Lord is that the man with the writer's inkhorn, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, must go through “Christendom” and put a mark upon those who sigh and cry, and do this by giving them an opportunity to hear and to learn the truth. In obedience to this commandment the servant of the Lord does this xvork and completes it, and, as recorded in the eleventh verse of that prophecy, reports the matter and says: “I have done as thou hast commanded me.” Thereafter the slaying work begins, and no one is spated in that slaughter work except those who have received the mark on their foreheads. This prophetic drama definitely fixes the time and order in which Jehovah does his work, and shows that the testimony work must be done and finished before Armageddon begins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Further supporting this conclusion is the scripture recorded concerning Lot escaping from Sodom, and which record appears in the eighteenth and nine-tienth chapters of Genesis. God sent his representatives to Sodom to ascertain the facts concerning the abominations done there and to destroy Sodom. Abraham stood in the presence of the Lord and made a plea in behalf of the city. God said to Abraham that if he could find in the city as many as ten righteous ones he would not destroy the city. But that many were not found. Only Lot, his wife and two daughters escaped, and the others were destroyed. We know that Sp.'om pictured Satan’s wicked organization on earth, and particularly that part called “Christendom”, because it is written that ‘the great city is called Sodom, where (thrist Jesus was crucified ’. (Rev. 11:8) The final fulfillment of this prophetic picture, without doubt, is at the end of the world and after the coining of the Lord Jesus, for the reason that Jesus said: “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded ; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heax-cn, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the dav xvhen the Son of man is revealed.”—Luke </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">17:</span><span class="font3">28-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Until quite recently God’s faithful people on the earth understood that most of the peoples of the earth xvould pass through the great tribulation. This understanding corresponds to Abraham's expressed hope that the city, picturing “Christendom”, would be sax’ed because of some righteous ones there. But it is seen that it is only those xvho “seek righteousness and meekne-s” that have the promise of being spared and taken through Armageddon. (Zeph. 2: 3; 1 Pet. 4:18) The Scriptures state that Lot was a just and righteous man and was vexed because of the wicked ones dwelling about him. (2 Pet. 2:7,8) Sodom is set forth as an example of tho.e xvhom God will destroy at Armageddon. (Jude 7) Lot corresponds exactly with that class described in Ezekiel nine who are marked in their foreheads, and in the prophetic picture here c'nr.id-cred lie stands particularly as representing the great multitude. Lot received the warning and fled before the destruction of the city; and likewise the great multitude must receive warning and flee to the kingdom organization before Armageddon, which will destroy Satan’s organization. Not only must they who compose the great multitude flee before Armageddon breaks, but they must abide with the Lord's organization, seeking righteousness and meekness; otherwise they will be destroyed. This is clearly shown by what befell Lot’s wife. In this connection Jesus said: “In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Hemember Lot's wife.’’—Luke 17•.31,32.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The rules of Jehovah do not change. (Mal. 3:6) “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.’’ (Luke 9:62) Of necessity, the divine rule applies to those who are spirit-begotten, and also to those who have declared themselves on the side of Jehovah and his organization. Having once started to follow the Lord, then he who turns back shall not sunive. This was pictured by Lot’s wife looking back and by the one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back or turns hack. There is only one way that leads to life; and when one starts in that way and then turns back, destruction is certain to result, because, said Jesus, “strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.’’—Matt. 7:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Life is a gracious gift of God through Christ Jesus; and when one having learned the way of life starts in that way and then turns back, he draws back to perdition, and such is his fate.—lleb. 6:4-6; 10:26-29, 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> There are many other Scripture texts bearing specifically on this point, and which show conclusively that the witness work must be done and that those who form the great multitude must hear and flee to God's organization before Armageddon begins. Among those texts bearing clearly upon the point are these: 2 Kings 10:15-23 and Jeremiah 35:19, which texts relate to Jonadab joining himself unto Jehu. Also Genesis 6:lS-22 and Genesis 7:1-13, concerning those who entered the ark with Noah and were passed over from the old world. Also Numbers 35: 9-34, pertaining to those who flee to the city of refuge.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS STRANGE WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>39</sup> The work that is now being done on e.u th.-which advertises the King and his kingdom, nu-nii’-. ,tly is God's woik, and is called “his strange work'', by the language of the prophet. (Isa. 28:21) Ciirist Jems is conducting that work in obedience to Jehorah's will. All who love and serve Jehovah are commanded to make known this kingdom menage. This v.mh. |., &lt;&nbsp;been in progress particularly since 1922, at v.’.ndi tim: God’s people received the enlightenment al the out-pouiing ot the holy spiiit on all flesh. The o!&gt;!i-_;ition is laid upon the servant class to toll the trail ami to proclaim it, although 1he truth exposes the &lt;je&gt;Md-ness of religionists who claim to be repie.-’ ■iitcii-., - u. God on earth. The proclaiming of the messagi of 1: mb as commanded now tends to pull down tin slronehohL of the religious organization. The people Irwe he&lt;n led to believe that them religious organimlem represent God ; and a work that now manifestly is puiim-' down those religious organizations appears to them to be a very strange thing. Jehovah by his prophet declares that he will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim and that he will do his work, his strange work. This strange work of the Lord is now being done because it is the time of judgment when the Lord Jesus has gathered before him the nations and is separating goats from the sheep. It is during this same time that the “hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place’’. (Isa. 28:17) “Hail” represents very hard, solid truths, and the overflowing waters picture the flood of truth that is spreading throughout the earth. That “strange work” is now in progress, and it is a war of truths against entrenched racketeers who have falsely applied God’s Word to hide their own nefarious conduct. This work is not Armageddon, however. When the “strange work” is completed, then what shall follow?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS ACT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth are privileged to participate in the “strange work” of the Lord and to be coworkers with God, in this, that they proclaim the day of his vengeance, and the message concerning his King and kingdom. They do not, however, have any part in the expression of God’s wrath, that is, the execution thereof. Vengeance belongs to the Lord. An act of God is a specific exhibition of his supreme power against the enemy. The flood in Noah’s day was an act of God. The destruction of Pharaoh’s army in the Red sea was an act of God. The destruction of Sennacherib’s army before Jerusalem was an act of God. Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, will be an act of Jehovah God executed by Christ Jesus and his invisible army, resulting in the complete destruction of every part of Satan’s organization. The “strange work” of Jehovah, as the Scriptures clearly show, brings into disrepute and into disgrace in the eyes of many the religious systems that have so long defamed God’s name, and will destroy the power of those systems over the people. Thereafter, as the Scriptures show, the clergy who have practiced religion to the detriment of the people and to the defamation of God’s name v ill deny the accusation that they ever were clergymen. Says the scripture at Zechariah 13: 4, 5: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets [preachers] shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.” These surviving clergymen, therefore, declare themselves a part and arc a part of the commercial clement of Satan’s organization that is a part of the “beast”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> Note now in Revelation 19 that after the destruction of the old “whore” system all those on the Lord's side are called to witness the slaughter of the “beast” and the “false prophet”, which are taken and destroyed in the battle of Armageddon. (Rev. 17:17; 19:17-20) Then follows the taking of the Devil himself. (Rev. 20:1-3) The battle which Joshua fought at the ancient city of Gibeon is undoubtedly a picture of God’s “strange act”, the battle of Armageddon. The battle of Gibeon was in two parts, but it was all fought on one day, and there was no lapse of time between the beginning and the ending thereof. The first part of the battle was fought at the city gales, and then the enemy fled in an effort to get away or escape. As the enemy fled Joshua prayed that the light of the sun and of the moon might continue until the enemy was destroyed. It was at this point in the battle that the Lord cast down from heaven great chunks of ice that slew the enemy. (Josh. 10:10-12) That was an act of God foietelling his “act, his strange act”, that will completely wreck the world. The Gibconitcs who put themselves under Joshua before that battle pictured the great multitude, and the latter put themselves under Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, befoie the battle of Armageddon. After the battle begins there is no opportunity to flee to the Lord’s organization. Jesus himself emphasizes that fact in his statement at Matthew 24:14-21. the Lord declares that all shall know that he is Jehovah ; and when his great act, his strange act, begins in the destruction of all of Satan’s visible organization, as well as invisible, that v ill, to many who will recognize it is God doing the destruction, certainly appear to be very strange, because they have been led to believe that the governments and ruling powers of this world rule by divine right, and that they will survive for ever. When the witness work is done, then will come the great fight, and then only tho«e who are on the side of the Lord will be spared and taken through the great battle.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DILIGENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> This is the day of Jehovah, which is designated in the .Scriptures as “that day”. It is the day in which he has enthioned his King and sent him to the temple for judgment. It is the day in which his work, his strange work, is being done, in which all who have aligned themselves with the Lord are commanded to have a part in singing forth the praises of Jehovah. The Devil in this day is attempting to cause God's people to slow down in their work, and he uses many fraudulent methods to accomplish that purpo'-e, amongst which is the fear of man, and the selfish desire to wait for ‘a more favorable time’ to work. He uses those who speak in the name of the Lord to induce the faithful to de’ay their work and slack their hand. But God’s elect will be on the alert and will not be deeehed. Those who are of God’s organization or associated vith his organization in praising Jeho-v; h are designated under the term “Jerusalem”, while “Zion” pictures tho'c who are of the anointed remnant with Christ Jesus. To all who aie on the Lord's side Jehovah now says: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. ’ ’—Zeph. 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> Jehovah’s people are now engaged in a common work of proclaiming his praises. In obedience to the Lord’s commandment they must participate in God’s work, and their part of the work must be done with diligence and without slacking up. Those who will survive will continue with diligence praising Jehovah, declaring his name throughout the earth, and advertising his King and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>VINDICATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S witnesses now recognize that Ezekiel’s prophecy was written at the dictation of Jehovah, to be understood only in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It discloses Jehovah’s universal organization which gives birth Io the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ancient Jerusalem was used to foreshadow what is now called “Christendom”. Jerusalem became hypocritical, corrupt and oppressive. God sent Ezekiel to warn and serve notice upon Jerusalem of her impending destruction. The city was destroyed and only a remnant of the people escaped. Such was a miniature fulfillment of the prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greater fulfillment of the prophecy is upon “Christendom”, which has become hypocritical, corrupt and oppressive. Jehovah God now makes known to his witnesses the meaning of the prophecy, and sends them forth to give warning and to serve notice upon “Christendom” of her impending de truetion. Ezekiel pictured these witnesses, who also tell the people of God’s provision for their salvation. Tho witnesses must give the warning, following v.hieh “Chri &gt;-tendoin” will fall and a small number of the people will escape. Those who love God and who are now Ins witnesses will now gladly serve the notice on “Christendom” and give the warning to the rulers and to the people. Thus they will honor Jehovah's name. If you will be one of these true and faithful witne-&gt;-cs your eternal ble.-sing is sine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vindication</span><span class="font3"> of Jehovah's name has come. Blessed is the man who takes his stand on the side of Jehovah God, in the service of Ills King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vindication of the name and word of the eternal God is proved and justified by Ez’kiel's prophecy, which reveals v.hat mud spiedily come to p.<sup>1</sup>- ; upon the nations of the v.orld. At Jeremiah 10: 10 it i~ written that “the Lord is the true God, lie is the living God, and an ovi rbwting King: at his wrath the eoith shall trend !e, and the m.tier;:. shall not be a’ ie to ahi his indignation”. “Let thy name be magnified for ever. ’ ’—2 Sam. 7: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah caused to be written, more than 2500 years ago, what in the Bible is called Ezekiel’s prophecy. During the centuries that prophecy has been a mystery sealed to all who have sought to unlock it. God’s due time has come for the prophecy to be understood. He has brought to pass events disclosing its meaning, and these events, well known to millions of people, placed beside the prophecy, make it plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The miniature fulfillment of the prophecy was upon Jerusalem and the nations there round about. Its greater and complete fulfillment is upon “Christendom” and the other nations now of the world. In this day of great distress and perplexity it opens to the vision of godly men the things that must speedily come to pass and guides the obedient into the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Its testimony now due to be given is notice and solemn warning to “Christendom” and to all the world. It announces God’s judgments already written against the “man of sin”, against “Christendom”, her rulers, and chief men, and against all who have defamed the name of the Most High. It makes known the great tribulation just ahead for the world, and how some may be shielded and protected and carried through that trouble and blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Its message is that of comfort and encouragement to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who are now on the earth. It tells when and how Jehovah God will prove, exonerate and vindicate his word and holy name, uplift and bless his obedient creation, and make the world a place of everlasting peace and joy. Every intelligent creature should know its contents, read it and profit thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s name is of far greater importance than all other things. The time must come when Jehovah’s name will be upon every creature, and then everything that breathes will extol and honor his name. Only those W'ho come to a knowledge of Jehovah and who honor his name will be given life everlasting. Jesus0 stat eel when he was on earth, but only a few to this day have believed that his words are true. The detaining of God’s name was begun by the traitor Satan, and the entire organization which the enemy buikled has continued to reproach his holy name. Tnc removing of Satan and his organization will result in clearing Jehovah’s name, and then all intelligent creatures may learn without hindrance the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The truth must be made known to the end that the name of Jehovah may be vindicated. It is the expressed will of God that all creation shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth and that then those who believe and obey and practice the truth shall live. All others will be destroyed. The origin of man, the course man has followed, how man may be recovered and granted life everlasting, is truthfully stated in the Bible. It is found nowhere else except in publication! 1 hat base</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">every’ doctrine upon the Bible testimony’. (Isa. 8:23) Jehovah is true and his Word is the truth. Every man that is brought into harmony with God must learn the truth. Concerning those who will please God, Jesus said: “Sanctify them through thy’ truth: thy’ word is truth.”—John 17:17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That which is the very opposite of truth is a lie. Satan is the author or father of lies. (John 8: 44) lie began his lies by’ disputing the word of God and by bringing reproach upon God’s name. That first lie led perfect man into the way of wickedness and brought upon the entire human race sorrow’, sickness, suffering and death. In the centuries past Satan has pursued his course of lying and wickedness without hindrance and has budded a mighty organization in the earth by which he has brought reproach upon the name of Jehovah God and has turned the mass of the people away’ from God. To accomplish his wicked purposes Satan has resorted to all manner of lying, fraud and deception. The chief clement of his organization, b.v which he has defrauded the people and reproached God’s name, is the religious element. This he started with Babylon, and from then till now the name Babylon has attached to all religions used by .Satan to bring reproach upon the name of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greater the deception practiced, the greater the reproach ; and so-called “organized Chri-.tianity”, or “Christendom”, stands at the very head of all hypocritical religions that have been used to deceive the people and to defame God’s holy name. Title Christianity means to truly and faithfully follow’ Christ Jesus and to honor G.d’s name. “Orga u el Christianity,” or “Christendom”, has taken the name of Christ Jesus but has practiced everything but the truth. Just enough of the Bible has been used to mislead and deceive the people, even as Satan misused parts of God’s Word in attempting to entice Jesus. (Matt. 4:6) “Christendom,” or “organized Chiis-tianity”, lias therefore become the greatest of all refuges or hiding places of lies. God lias abode his own due time to expose and to destroy all hypocritical ami wicked organizations. Now his time has come to uncover the lies, and expose the false religions and ev&lt; ry other pait of Satan’s organization; and this he declares he will do by and through the truth made known to mankind. The time is therefore come when lies shall be torn from the place of power and authority; and truth enthroned will continue to rule forever; and this will be a vindication of God’s word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By his prophet Jehovah says: “Behold, 1 lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation : he that believe! h shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail [hard truths] shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters [flood of truth] shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:16, 17) Zion here mentioned is God’s or,&quot;.animation, and Christ Jesus the King of glory </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is the </span><span class="font3">Chief Corner Stone mentioned by the prophecy. Already God has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and presented him as King of the world, and thus the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Corner </span><span class="font3">Stone has been laid. Now Christ Jesus the great </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge </span><span class="font3">has come to the temple of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font3">for judgment and the judgment is in progress; hence the time is at hand </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font3">hard and plain truths to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">told and, thus continuing, the truth, like a flood of water, shall rise, ex</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">posing </span><span class="font3">the lies by disclosing their hiding place, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font3">sweep away all hindrances </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the people in gain</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">campaign to make known the truth of God's </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Word </span><span class="font3">to the people is now in progress. In this woik the Lord is employing the radio and many books con</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">taining </span><span class="font3">the explanation of the Bible, and these are put in the hands of the people that they may know the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">truth. </span><span class="font3">The work of vindicating God’s name has begun, and will go on until every man, from the least </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font3">greatest, shall know </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">Jehovah is the only true God. Then never again will the truth be bedraggled and hid from the view of God’s creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">Israelites were God’s covenant people clrsen by him and used chiefly to make pictures which foreshadow his purposes. Such pictures arc made understandable to men in due time in order that the anointed people of God may have hope and in order that the rulers and the people in general may be served with notice of what God is about to do to make a name for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah sent his prophet to the king of Israel and caused him to say: “I will set up thy seed after thee, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font3">shall proceed out of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">thy </span><span class="font3">bowels, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">will establish his kingdom, lie shall build an house for my name, and I will stabhsh the throne of his kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">ever.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 </span><span class="font3">Sam. 7:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12,</span><span class="font3">13) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font3">those words Jehovah stated the importance of the kingdom in connection </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font3">the vindication and the honor </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">his name. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“seed” </span><span class="font3">there mentioned undoubtedly means Christ Jesus, the beloved of God who was foreshadowed by King David. The King of glory Jehovah now has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">placed </span><span class="font3">upon his throne. (Ps. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2:6) </span><span class="font3">“An house for my name” means the organization of Jehovah of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Chief. That which will load to the exaltation of the name of Jehovah in the minds and hearts of all his creatures is a knowledge of and obedience to the truth. God has taken out from the world “a people for his name”, which people are the first ones to be favored with a knowledge of the truth.—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is fitting that God used David, who foreshadowed his beloved King Christ Jesus, to write and say to the people taken out for his name: “Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name ; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.” (Ps. 29:2) And thus the people so taken out for God’s name speak to one another. It is the expressed will of Jehovah that ‘the people taken out for his name’ shall bear to the world the message of truth that Jehovah is the only true God, and thus be the witnesses of Jehovah at this time. (Isa. 43:10-12; 42:6) Jehovah caused his holy prophets to write concerning the vindication of his name, and now his due time has come for his “faithful servant” to understand the meaning of the prophecies, and I lie “servant” is directed to serve notice upon the rulers and the people of and concerning God’s purposes as the prophets long ago wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ezekiel was one of the holy prophets of God. Heretofore his prophecy has not been understood, manifestly because it was not God’s time for it to be understood. The theme that runs throughout the entire book of Ezekiel is that of the vindication of .Jehovah’s name. The phrase, “Know that I am the Loan [Jehovah],” occurs more than sixty times in the prophecy. More than anj' other book in the Bible the prophecy of Ezekiel mentions this great and all-important truth. The opening chapters give a setting for the understanding of the book when the due time arrives for its understanding, and for that reason the'C chapters should be carefully considered. Prophecies are not always fulfilled in the order in which they ate set down in the Scriptures, but a proper setting is necessary for the harmonizing of the entire prophecy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Greetings in our Father the great Jehovah’s namel We thought it might be pleasing to know how our little band of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">warriors for </span><span class="font2">Jehovah and for Gideon are standing the fight, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and we </span><span class="font2">ate filled with gratitude beyond expression of words for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font2">new avenue of service and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">being permitted to eat and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">drink </span><span class="font2">deep into the wateis of life </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">truth that proceed ftom Jehovah, through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2">kindled publications.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deaf. Brother Rltheiiiord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We piaise Jehovah for the marvelous vvay in which He has used you this night [February 23] to proclaim His kingdom message to the ends of the caith. Sister and mysell were piiv-ileged to hear your voice in our own home through Radio Normandie. The reception was very good, and every word was heard distinctly; and we with you, and those with you at Los Angeles, joined in out Ayes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You will lie interested to know that it was through Nu&gt;&quot;-ber 27 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> that we both came into patent tiuth; : n I we, by God’s favor, enjoy the food which comes to us thioug.i </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We daily remember you at the throne of heavenly giaee, ami we piay that Jehovah may continue to guide and bless you and ime you to the honor of his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With warm love, we are</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH'S FULFILLMENT OF HIS PROMISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Loving greetings from under the Southern Cross!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is now some sixteen and eleven yea is. lespectively, since my wife and I were enabled to enter into full-time setvice, and the luxury of a brief backvvaid glanee fills us with gratitude for the privilege of it all and for the loving care and guidance of our God tluoughout those yeais. From the days when we had but the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies lu the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> for witnessing, then </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font2"> followed by the constant stream of books and booklets as we have them now, the opening up of the radio, the introduction of the testimony card, and now, as a crowning feature, the sound machines; to have seen and been associated with all these features of Jehovah’s arrangement is to have witnessed the fulfillment of his premise to provide all things </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">needful</span><span class="font2"> for his people to continue faithful in service without murmuring or complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The revelation concerning the ‘‘great multitude” was marvelous, and it is happifving to see how, in the pioneer groups, the anointed and those who profess to be ‘‘Jonadabs” are now woikmg together harmoniously, without distinction, pleased to have any position in God’s oigamzation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over heie in Tasmania our little pioneer group is battling away, pleased to be in the fiont line of the light. Our teiritoiy is scattered and (like Jei nsalem) surrounded by mountains, and the weather has ranged in a short while from veiy waim (with bu‘h fires and dust) to very cold (with ice and snow). But we keep on the job, being comtoitable with a car and trailer caravan kindly provided for the pioneers by the Tasmanian fiiends. Covering our terntoiy involves dining and walking many miles, but we seek to cover it thoroughly and to present the books and lectures to everyone, no mutter where they aie located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sound work is a gieat help to us. In the thickly populated aieas the round cais do a great vvoik, but in the countiy districts here the phonographs have been invaluable. A checkup on our woik shows that in two months one plionogiaph alone had an audience of 1,887 people and m that time the placements in conjunction with that machine weie 1, lb'G pieces of liteia-ture. 'J he group phonogiuphs have been played in private homes, on doomteps, in lactones, m olhces, in poliln.il organizations, in police stations, on shop eounteis, on hotel tins, at a piclu e theater, before schools, in camps, on the roadside, in the middle of paddocks, in mansions, m hovels; and cveiywhere that message in no uncertain voice has impartially expressed judgment and shown the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One woman, heaiinga lectuic for the first time, said, ‘‘That’s a new idea! Anyway, it is a gie.it help to yon, as you do not have to talk so much and it explains things better than you could.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On another occasion a sister and I canied the phonograph on a stiik between us for two miles thtough the budi. At one tunc the track threatened to peter out and we wondered whether to turn back. But we pu hed on, and suddenly came on the house at the top of a hill. The woman of the house pioved to bo interested and was pleased to take a Bible and set of booklets. When she lieaid the leetuies she said, ‘‘You would leatn mure from that in an hour than by going to chuieh for months. ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again, when my wife and I had earned the phonograph for a mile along a timber tiamvvay to get to a hou-e bulled away in the bush, the man thanked us for bringing Inin the lecture and books, as ‘veiy few people bothered to tiy to get to him with any message’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We realize that no cientuie deserves any credit for the success of Jehovah’s purposes. If vic worked ourselves to a standstill we would bi ing Jehovah no piofil; the c. cat me who is faithful stands to gain all that. We are judged by the elfoit we put forth of could put forth to fulfill our </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">com</span><span class="font2"> mint. This applies to carrying the phonograph. We cannot judge one another in this respect, but each must lender account to Jehovah as to whether all means of witnessing aie fully exploited. Wc have found that if anyone is physically incapable of canying a phonograph, if the workeis go in pans each one has a share in the sound woik and the pl.u-ements vvoik out in propoitiou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At our little ‘‘Bethel” soivice eveiv morning our prayers are flat the oiganization may be guided aught and that the faithful m.iy be prefixed to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the triumph of ughtemisness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVIDING OF THE PEOPLE NOW PLAINLY </span><span class="font2">SEEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Df.'i: Brother Ruthemoed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For a long time we have desired to expiess out appreciation of the privilege that we have of being associated with you and the Society in this vvondeiful kingdom work. Many times our hearts go up to Jehovah in true thankfulness for this opportunity, and we especially remember you at the throne of grace that your hand may be strengthened for the great work God has entrusted to you. We also thank him for the assistance tint comes from the arrangements made to aid us by you and the sacrifice that the friends make to keep us in the service. We also wish to express our sincere gratitude for the different books, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">that come to us regularly. What a feast we have now in the ‘‘feast of tabernacles”. Surely the remnant and the great multitude liave many reasons for rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have been in the pioneer vvoik for over four years and we have many proofs that the Lord’s aim has not been shortened in providing for his little ones who have given up everything to do his vvoik. When we first started in the work we planned on going from one terntoiy to another, but it was suggested by the pioneer department that we could liave a permanent assignment by- asking for the same terntoiy again. This we decided to do, and v.c have had many indications of the Lord blessing in doing so. We are now going over our assignment the fourth time. Now wo see the division of the people so plainly. Some who would have nothing to do with the message the other times are now accepting some of the literature. We have formed a gioup for study m one city and some have had a little part in the seiviic vvoik, and otheis will, no doubt, take a prirt soon. Some out of the goodness of their hearts and a love for the Lord have aided us in various ways. Wo have accepted this as from the hands of the Lord and to further the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again we wish to expiess our appreciation of the piivilego of being in the Lord organization and our deteiimitation re sene Almighty' God throughout eternity in whatever way ho may wish it done. With Chnslian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in the King’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Devr Brothik Rutiiekiohd:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hope you will excuse me for taking a little of your time. I know that you aie veiy busy. But I was so tlmlled to heai your voice last evening [Februaiy 2.1], from nine to ten o’clo'k Norwegian time, that 1 must write and tell you. Sony to s.iy that it was only myself that undeistood the English language well. Eveiy vvoid was distinct, ft was not neaily so good when we heaid you in O-lo last summer, whin you spoke from the Washington convention. It came over from Geiniany and Sweden that time. Twice there was an mteriuption for about half a minute. It was Sweden and Russia that interfered, but then it was very clear again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I shouted ‘‘Aye!” with the convention brethren in Los Angeles, and I suppose we all did over the world. 1 was praying the Lord blessing over the convention, and that we unseen listeneis might be penmtted to hear you. Only Jehovah’s power could bung such things to pass as to hear so many thousand miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I wonder if the pope heaid it. Hope he did; also that man Hitler. Well, they will get what they deserve in Aimageildon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am so thankful to Jehovah for having such a leader ns you, dear brothel; and may Jehovah showei his ble-sings upon you, is my daily player.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIDENCE OF- LOVE FOR JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As one of the prisoners who was released by Jehovah’s gracious provision, I should indeed feel unworthy if 1 did not express my gratitude to Jehovah and to yourself and all others who exercised sueh tireless effort in behalf of those who were in bonds. This is tiuly evidence of jour complete love for Jehovah, as is testified to by the apostle John in 1 John 5:2: &quot;By this ive know that vve love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.&quot; it is my determination that by the Lord’s grace I shall always keep his commandments and that in this my love for God and for all the brethren shall ever be in evidence, as is exemplified by this act of love shown on behalf of the brethren who weie imprisoned because of their testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font2">Orange, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whatever the outcome of the appeal may be, I shall take it as the Lord’s will, and only hope that it will result to the praise of Jehovah God and the encouiagemcnt of the brethren as it did in the apos le Paul’s ease, as noted in Philippians 1: 13, 14: &quot;So that my bondj in ('bust are manifest in all [Caesar’s court], and in all other places; and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confid -nt by my bonds, aie much moie Hid to speak the woid without fear.&quot; As for the enemy, and pdi-tieul.-nly the Mount Seir section of his oiganization, the pie nouneement of the judgment of Jehovah as lecorded in Ezekiel 35: 12-15 is a happy anticipation to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please be assmed, my dear Brother Rutherford, of my sincere gratitude and earnest deteiinitiation to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of Jehovah’s organization for the vii.dieatioil of his most holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With you in the King’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just a woid to acknowledge my appreciation and heartfelt thanks for the special privilege of making known the name and kingdom of Jehovah God, and to be fully united under the leaderdnp of Christ </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jcsih.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having been brought into the light 1 go forth with all desire to help others that have the love of the truth to that same privilege.

<p><span class="font2">1 trust Hint 1 may be given courage. One thing I know: whatever may be the test, Christ has gone before me and I must stand my test, hoping to do all to the glorification of Jehovah God and his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I, like others, hate to take up any time from those in th<sup>1 </sup>Lord’s vvoik. Y'et how could I be contented Without acknowledging your aid, Brother Rutherford, together with the aid of the family at Bethel, and expressing my appieciatiou and thankfulness to the Giver of all good, who supplies all oui need.--, to make it possible for us to continue in his service, whoso heaits the great Jehovah God has caused to want to ring forth his praises? Regardless of any and all opposition the enemy and his host would heap upon Jehovah’s witnesses, may we make full use of all the benefits, recognizing oui post of duty, and joyfully witness under any circumstances, knowing that it will be given us in the very hour what we need to proceed to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daily I piay that Jehovah God will prosper his work, and his favors continue with you, dear biethren, ami ui who aie co-operatnig with you to move as one man in the army of the Lord under Christ Jesus. How absurd, with sueh teachers as Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, so clearly dis', ingui-lied sim-e the coming of the Lord to the temple, to conclude or be influenced that a man is attempting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">so f/reat a &gt;&lt;&nbsp;syon nbtblii' </span><span class="font2">My heart is full to oveiflowing with all that is spread on tintable, in the presence rd our enemies, coming to us through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">11 atchtowcis.</span><span class="font2"> I would love to tell you at least &lt;&gt;t tome of the things that 1 gather from three to tour if not six readings I sometimes wonder, if I had more time to read and studs, how much more I would be able to get from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">7'of'cm.</span><span class="font2"> With sue h light one is compelled to tell others of God and Ins kingdom, that they in turn may hear and say &quot;Come&quot;. I must not take up any more of your time, though.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Words do not express my joy in the service, Brother Rutherford. Y'ou have my prayer and good wishes, as 1 know vve have yours in the pioneer vvoik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May wo continue as vve are commanded and watch the vindication of the Mo.-t High.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>PRIESTS AND LEVITES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to Ms sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation.”—Num. 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH selected Aaron to accompany Moses to Egypt, and afterwards he chose Aaron to minister in the priest's office as the high priest. First the high priest was chosen, and then the underpriests. Jehovah instructed Moses: “And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office, even Aaron, Nadal) and Abihn, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. And for Aaron’s sons Ilion shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; ami shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.” (Ex. 28:1,40,41) Aaron was a Levite.— Ex. 4:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The tribe of Levi was taken by the Lord in the place and stead of the firstborn. (Num. 3:41) After the selection of the high priest and the underpricsts the Levites were given to the priests to be servants to them, the priests. (Num. 8:19; 18:23) At the time the high priest and the underpriests were selected to be servants of God in the priest’s office the tribe of Levi was not even mentioned as an official tribe or officially recognized. Later the tribe of Levi was made an official tribe and consecrated to the service of the Lord Jehovah, and that only after the selection of Aaron and his sons, to serve in the priest’s office, had been made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">’When the patriarch Jacob pronounced a blessing on his twelve sons, including Levi, there was no promise made to Levi that a priesthood should come out of that tribe. Nothing was then said about or any promise made concerning the priesthood. (Gen. 49:5-7) The father and mother of Moses anti Aaron were distinguished for their faith in Jehovah rather than for the fact of being of the tribe of Levi. (Ex. 2:1-10; 6:1G-2O) They were commended for their faith in Jehovah. (Hob. 11:23) Aaron was chosen as the spokesman or “prophet” of Moses to appear before Pharaoh because of the inability of Moses to speak fluently. (Ex. 7:1, 2) After that the firstborn of Israel were sanctified. (Ex. 12:12; 13:1,2) It was some time later that the tribe of Levi was substituted by Jehovah for the firstborn. After the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt Aaron continued to serve as spokesman for Moses. (Ex. 16: 9,10) Then Aaron was put in charge of the golden pot of manna. (Vss. 33, 34) Still later Aaron alone accompanied Moses up to Mount Sinai at the. giving of the law.—Ex. 19: 24, 25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> At the time Moses and Aaron were in the, mountain of Sinai there were then priestsserving the Israelites, but they had not been appointed by Jehovah, as far as the record discloses. None of those priests were permitted to come up into Mount Sinai. (Ex. 19:24) Some time later Aaron and his four sons, together with seventy elders of the Israelites, were invited to ‘come up unto the Lord in the mountain and worship afar off’. (Ex. 24:1-14) All the foiegoing historical facts mentioned took place before Aaron and his sons were selected for the pi icsthood.-Ex. 27 : 21 ; 28 :1-4, 29; 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> It appears, therefore, that Aaron was called and chosen to be the high priest, not merely because he was a Levite, but because of the fact that he was a brother of Moses, who had shown his faith in Jehovah God. Moses was chosen by Jehovah as a priest superior to Aaron. lie was also a prophet, because of his faith and faithfulness, and not because he was of the tribe of Levi. P&gt;oth Moses and Aaron, in the performance of their duties to which they were officially' assigned, foreshadowed Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and Priest of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LEVITES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The priests were selected from the tribe of Levi, and those of the tribe of Levi, aside from the priests, were given service to the Israelites and were the servants to the priesthood. Otherwise they rendered assistance to the priests in the performance of the service of the Lord in Israel. Does this indicate two separate and distinct classes of spirit-begotten ones, to wit, the priests, representing the “little flock” (Luke 12: 32), and, second, the Levites, representing the less faithful class called the “tribulation saints” and often called the “great multitude”? The Scriptures do not support that conclusion. There seems to be no Scriptural support for the conclusion that the tribe of Levi, that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">is, those aside from the priests, in any manner typified or represented the great multitude as described in Revelation seven. It seems necessary to submit here some Scriptural proof, in view of what has heretofore been held, as set forth in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1911, pages 21 and 22. In doing so it appears to be necessary to take notice of the Bible history concerning the tribe of Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> Closes, accompanied by Joshua, his minister, was in the mountains at the command of Jehovah, and after he had been there forty days he discovered that the Israelites had sinned against the Lord, in this, that they had made and were worshiping a golden calf. Seeing the terrible plight into which the Israelites had gotten themselves, Moses made a bold declaration in their presence and hearing: “Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto mo. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.”—Lx. 32:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> When all the Levites had gathered themselves unto Moses, then Moses commanded them to “slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour”, and the Levites did according to the words of Moses, and about three thousand fell that day. “ h'or Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord, even every man Ujron his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.” (Ex. 32:25-29) On this occasion it was the tribe, of Levi that exhibited their faith and devotion to Jehovah Cod. Even at that time the Levites were not dedicated for any special service in connection with the tabernacle. The tabernacle service is mentioned in connection with the Levites at Exodus 38: 21. Even this text does not specify the tribe of Levi, but clearly refers exclusively to the priests who were taken from the tribe of Levi. In the book of Leviticus there is no mention made of the tribe of Levi except in connection with the jubilee arrangement.—Lev. 25: 32-34.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>0</sup> Aaron, who was a Levite, married a woman of the tribe of Judah, the family in line for the kingdom of Israel. She was the daughter of one of the great grandfathers of King David, from winch tribe of Judah came the Lord Jesus. (Ex. 6:23; Ruth 4: 20-22) The descendants of Aaron, therefore, occupied the relationship of priest and king among Cod’s chosen people. The first mention made, as appears from the record, concerning the Levites’ serving at the tabernacle is at Numbers: “But thou shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over al] things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, Ine Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.”—Num. 1: 50, 51, 53.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The Scriptural record does not disclose that the Levites assisted in the erection of the tabernacle, but mention of the tribes of Judah and Dan are specifically made in that connection. Service in connection with the tabernacle by the Levites was after it had been erected. That the Levites were specially set aside for service to the Lord is shown by the fact that they were not numbered for war service.—Num. 1:47-54; 2:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> At the time God smote the firstborn of Egypt he set aside the firstborn of all the tribes of Israel as the specially favored ones of the Israelites. After the Israelites had left Egypt the Levites were ‘elected instead of the firstborns and assigned to the tabernacle service, and concerning that it is written: “And toe Lord spake unto Moses, saving, And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of I ;..el instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel; therefore the Leviics shall be mine; because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel both man and beast; mine shall they be; 1 am the Lord. Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of 1h‘* Levites instead of their cattle; and the Li vites sii ill be mine: I am the Lord.” (Num. 3:11-13,45) Tne Levites then were cleansed and presented to the Lmd for special service. They were separate and distinct from the other tribes. “And thou shall bring the Leviics before the Lord; and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the si twice of the Lord. And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt olivr the one for a sin offering, and the other for a I unit offering, unto the Lord, to make an atonement for the Levites. And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the Lord. Thus shalt thou separate ihe Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levitts shall be mine. And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the cone rogation <sub>; </sub>and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer<sup>1</sup> them for an offering.”—Num. 8:10-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The fact that the entire tribe of Levi was separated to the service of the Lord in the place and stead of the firstborn is a very permasive argument that the Levites, both priests and under priests, v\&lt;re typical of the “church of the firstborn, which are v.ritt -n m heaven”, and which prove faithful to God and are made membu's of the royal house, (Deb. 12 : 23) “And I have taken the Levites for all the fit Go w the children of Israel. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons [the priest and underpriests] from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, v.hcn the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.”—Num. 8:18,19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> It was a privilege God had given to Aaron and his sons to minister unto him at the, tabernacle in the priest's office, and it was no less a prhilege from the Lord that the others of the tribe of Levi were assigned to specific service in connection with the tabernacle Io assist the priesthood. Being a gift to the priest to do service at the tabernacle as assistants to the priest would strongly argue that all the Levites were members of the household of the high priest. In the sacrifice of the bullock and the Lord’s goat the entire tribe of Levi must have been represented; as it is written: “And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself.” (Lev. 16:11) The same thing was done with the blood of the Lord’s goat as was done with the blood of the bullock. (Lev. 16:15) The priest end the other Levites were all brethren, being of one family. The high priest was a representative of the entire tribe of Levi. (Dent. 33:8) The priests and the others of the tribe of Levi arc always associated together. The nonpricstly part of the tribe served their brethren who were serving in the priest’s office. Both were servers of the Lord, but not all wcie assigned to the same place of service. It is even so in the body of Christ that God hath “set the members ( very one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him”. “But now are they many members, yet but one body.” (1 Cor. 12:18, 20) The nonpriests of the tribe of Levi served the priests, not as the servants of men, but “as unto Ihc Lord”, as the Lord had assigned them places of service. Those in the church are likewise directed: “And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.” (Col. 3:23) Not everyone in the Lord’s organization can be assigned to the same place. Some may have a more responsible position than others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The priests and nonpriests were assigned to separate duties in the service, and the Levites, as a tribe, were represented in the high priest's person or body just the same as the underpriests were represented in the high priest. The argument is made that the Levites did not go into the Most Holy of the tabernacle on the day of atonement. That argument has no weight, for the reason that the underpriests did not go into the Most Holy on the day of atonement, nor even into the holy, the high priest alone going into the Most Holy on the day of atonement. (Lev. 16:17) Not all the Leiites could be called to the priesthood, because in the distribution of tabernacle service that service did not require such a great number of priests. That does not at all mean that the nonpricstly class was less faithful than those of the priesthood. All must be faithful if they would receive the Lord’s approval, and the Bible account shows that they were faithful to Jehovah and to Jehovah’s priest and to his king of the tribe of Judah. “But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the Lord, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business.” (2 Chron. 13:10) There is no Scriptural warrant for concluding that God used the nonpricstly ones of the tribe of Levi to represent a less faithful class. If the Lord did so, then tiiat would mean that it was a part of his purpose to approve some that were partially faithful; and such is absolutely out of harmony with God's expressed purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Noninheritance in the land applied to the priests and nonpriests all alike: “And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even 1he service of the tabernacle of the congregation.”—Num. 18:26,21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> None of the Levites had any inheritance in the land. If this means that the priestly class must inherit a heavenly and not an earthly place, the same is true with reference to the nonpricstly class. Since the “great multitude”, without a doubt, is an earthly and not a heavenly company, this would prove that the nonpriests of the Levites do not typify the great multitude. Even the nonpriests did priestly duties when the work was very heavy and required their service in that behalf. (2 Chron. 29:34; 36:16,17) The nonpriests of that tribe were singers in the temple. (1 Chron. 15:16-22; 16:4-6; 2 Chron. 5:12) They taught God’s law and expressed his judgment as commanded. (2 Chron. 17:8,9; 19:8-11) Such service could not find an antitype in a less faithful spirit-begotten company, and especially not at the end of the world, when the great multitude is brought forth. It is true that the nonpricstly Levites did not wear official garments. Instead of this showing that they pictured a less faithful class, which has heretofore been called the ‘tribulation or consolation class’, it would show that they did not represent a special class in the Lord's organization but merely pictured those who render service in the Lord’s organization. They served as unto the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMON INTERESTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” The interests of all the tribe of Levi, including priests, underpriests, and nonpriests, were all common. All ol them did service unto the Lord according to his commandments. Their division into groups according to the grade of service evidently was not mo;.nt to typify two separate and distinct classes of spirit-begotten ones, one faithful and the other less faithful; but to typify one service organization of God’s favored ones or firstborn ones at the temple doing service to which each one was assigned. It is exactly so today in the antitype. Not every one of Jehovah’s witnesses can serve at the same place. Some of them at headquarters, some at branch offices, and some pioneers, and some in other places, and all are doing service as unto the Lord. Whether in one place or the other, all are serving God and his kingdom and all are represented in the High Priest, Christ Jesus, who is their Head and Commander. If one suffers, all suffer; and if one rejoices, all rejoice. Some of them arc made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions, and others suffer by reason of being companions of God’s anointed ones who suffer indignities. (Hcb. 10: 32, 33) In the eyes of men some occupy less honorable positions than others, but in the sight of God there is no distinction, because God is no respecter of persons. (Eph. 6: 9) Faithful and complete devotion to him is what is pleasing and acceptable to Jehovah. There is not one scripture that even indicates that God approves and rewards an unfaithful class. There is no reason to conclude that God has a secondary spiritual class whom he rewards to some degree, because less faithful, and because they have gotten mixed up with the world and try to please both the world and God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CITIES OF REFUGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’* God’s law provided for six cities of refuge, all of which would be inhabited by the tribe of Levi, and of this tribe&quot; one of the cities was at Hebron, and that was occupied by the priests, who were, of course, Levites. If the nonpriestly Levites pictured a secondary class or class of consecrated ones who are less faithful than the royal house, then that would mean that the unwitting man-slayer would be fleeing to that part of God’s organization that is only partially faithful Io him. Such a conclusion is entirely unreasonable and is unscriptural. (Num. 35:2-15; 1 Chron. 6:57) The cities of refuge typified God’s faithful organization on earth as a whole and as a part of the royal house to which the man who slew another unawares might flee. The antitypical cities of refuge apply at the end of the world and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the beginning of the proclamation of the kingdom message. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1934, page 247.) The organization of Jehovah could not be made up of two divisions, one faithful and one only partially faithful, the latter of which we have heretofore called the “tribulation” class. This is another strong argument that the Levites pictured those faithful to God, and forming his organization, in which some occupy one position and some another position, as God has been pleased to place them in those positions, Christ Jesus being the great High Priest over the entire organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> There were some associated with the Israelites who were not Israelites. The “Nethinims” (meaning “given ones”) mentioned in the Scriptures were not Israelites. (1 Chron. 9:2) Joshua assigned those “given ones” to some menial service. (Josh. 9: 22-27) They are clearly distinguished from the Levites. (Ezra 2:70; 8: 20; Neh. 7: 73) The fact that the Nethinims did some service in connection with the tabernacle docs not at all argue that the Levites typified a class of persons destined to live on the earth for ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The Kohathites were one of the families of the tribe of Levi. Korah of the tribe of Kohath was an infamous rebel against God’s constituted arrangement for the tabernacle service. (Num. 16:1-25) Without a doubt Korah is used in the Scriptures to picture a spirit-begotten class once in line for the kingdom but who become unfaithful and are destroyed. “Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Co're. ” (Jude 11) Co're mentioned by Jude is the same mentioned in Numbers 16:1 and there spelled “Korah”. This shows that the Lord does not approve those who arc partially faithful and that he does not give any partially faithful a secondary place in his heavenly organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;BEAR THEIR INIQUITY”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> We having once gotten into the error that the “great multitude” is a spirit-begotten company that will be assigned to a secondary place in the heavenly kingdom, the prophecy of Ezekiel has heretofore been improperly applied to the great multitude. “And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.”— Ezek. 44:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> All those words of the text have herctofoic not been properly considered together. Note the text says “when Israel went astray”. The priests also at the time went astray, as well as the nonpriestly class. “But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel wont astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God: they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.”—Ezck. 44:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Instead of this prophecy’s showing two clashes of spirit-begotten ones, it shows this: That those consecrated ones and devoted to the Lord's service were mixed up at onetime with “Christendom” and indulging in such formalism as showed that they had gone astray from the Lord, and they arc designated as having garments soiled, that is to say, they were identified with others practicing forms of worship, and t&lt;&gt; some degree at least were mixing with the world. They got away from the true worship of Jehovah God. The prophecy shows that, after they bore their iniquity, a remnant returned to the Lord, and being cleansed by him at the temple judgment, and their iniquity, that is to say, their lawlessness, removed, they were fit for service. Those, being cleansed and becoming a remnant of all the antitypical Levites, some priests and some nonpriests, were all assigned to certain parts of service in the Lord’s organization. This fact was overlooked in considering this very prophecy in Vindication, Book Three, pages 265 to 269. This shows how God’s people get into an error by taking for granted that we have a proper understanding of the prophecy before the time the prophecy is fulfilled. It is another proof that no man can understand prophecy until it is fulfilled and no man can interpret propheej’ at any time. At the time Ihe afore-mentioned book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> was written God had not revealed to his people the proper understanding of the “great multitude’’.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Note also that before there was any deflection God gave instruction to the high priest that they should bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. “And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and thy father’s house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and tby sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.’’ (Num. 18:1) Clearly this reference is to the house of Levites, because the words “Thou, and thy sons, and thy father's house with thee” could refer to nothing less than all the tribe of Levi. The Scriptures immediately following, namely, Numbers 18:2-6, prescribe the duties of all the Levites, both priests, underpriests and nonpriests. Prior to that Jehovah had declared concerning the high priest that a plate of pure gold be made and there should be engraven upon that plate the words, “HOLINESS TO THE LOUD,’’ which plate must be attached to the forefront of the miter of the high priest, and then adds: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts.’’ (Ex. 28:35-38) These scriptures show that both priests and nonpricsts must bear certain iniquities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” As marking the antitypical fulfillment of these prophetic statements note this: that at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment of the house of God the antitypieal Levites, priests and nonpricsts, had gone astray and all such must bear their iniquity. There is no indication that there arc two spirit or distinctly separate classes in this judgment. It is clearly stated that the purpose of the coming of the Lord to the temple was to cleanse the sons of Levi; as it is written: “But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:2,3) These words, “he shall purify the sons of Levi,” must of necessity apply to all the antitypical Levites, including the priestly and nonpriestly class. It is the cleansed ones that are assigned to the service of the Lord that these may “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. All in line for the kingdom had to be cleansed and purified. Considering now the type in connection with the prophecy of Ezekiel (44:10-16), it is seen that the Levites, after they had strayed and alter they had been cleansed and returned to the Lord, were not assigned to a lower or less favored place in the service than they had occupied before they went astray. This shows that the ‘bearing of their own iniquity’ or lawlessness (meaning a lawless course of action) could not refer typically to the Levites’ being assigned to a secondary place or posit mu in heaven. The fact that the entire spirit-begotten company had to be cleansed when the Lord came to the temple shows that the entire spirit-begotten company had gone astray and were proceeding in an unlawful manner and that all who possessed a right condition of heart were cleansed by the Lord and the faith!ul class who were approved constituted the Lord’s “faithful and wise servant” class. (Matt. 24:45-17) The Scriptures show that the Lord was angry with them because they had gone astray, but when they had borne their iniquity and were cleansed and forgiven they rejoiced and said: “And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou cornfortedst me.”—Isa. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2I</sup>' Prior to that time the consecrated of earth looked upon the political rulers of this world as the “highm' powers”, whom they must obey, and they conformed themselves largely to the practices indulged in by “Christendom”. But when they withdrew from Babylon and were' cleansed and rejoiced, no more did they attribute salvation to any earthly powers nor look to earthly powers for protection, but said: “Behold, God is my salvation ; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw' water out of the wells of salvation.”—Isa. 12: 2,3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGELS SERVANTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Nor is there any reason to conclude that the Laid assigns a portion of the spirit-begotten ones to be servants of the “little Hoek” in heaven because they have been a less faithful class. The Lord appears at the temple accompanied by his host of holy angels to. do his service. (Mutt. 25:31) There would appear to be no need to transfer to heaven a great multitude of spirit-begotten ones who had been only partially faithful and give them a secondary pl ace of service in heaven with the angels during the thousand-year reign of Christ. If that were true, then God would be giving partially faiHiful earthly creatures a position equal to that of those wholly and entirely faithful angelic hosts, which is both inconsistent, unreasonable and unscriptural. Certainly it could not be said that Jehovah needs to find room and some form of service in heaven for a class of creatures that are viewed as a sort of by-product of his work. When Christ was on earth he declared that he was going away and would prepare a place for his followers that proved faithful, and not for some also who proved only partially faithful. (John 14:3) The Scriptures do not set forth promises to two classes of spirit-begotten ones. There never was any Scriptural reason for holding before men the hope of a secondary place in heaven that might be reached by way of the “back door’’. It is positively stated, on the contrary, that ‘all are called in one hope of our calling’, not two hopes (Eph. 4: 4) The begetting or acknowledgment of his sons called to the heavenly place by the Lord is in one hope, and that hope is to partake of the resurrection of Christ Jesus to an incorruptible inheritance. (1 Pet. 1:3,4; Phil. 3:10) Instead of a heavenly opportunity’s being reserved for those who become “less faithful” by drawing back and mixing up with Satan’s organization it is plainly stated in the Scriptures that such as do draw back and become unfaithful arc assigned to destruction.—Ilcb. 10:38,39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> To have part in the sin offering for mankind is not of first importance to those who become the followers of Christ Jesus, but to them that which is of first importance is to serve God’s organization and have a part with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The purpose of justification and spirit-begetting is not primarily to have a part in the sin offciing and assisting to uplift the world, but that which is of chief importance is to answer Satan’s false charge against God by proving that the creature following in the footsteps of Jesus can withstand the assaults of Satan and maintain his integrity toward God even though that means to such a sacrificial death. It is thus that one becomes associated with the great Vindicator. The taking of men to heaven is not of primary importance. The sacrifice of the followers of Christ adds nothing to the great ransom sacrifice to give it more power or effectiveness in the taking away of sins. Therefore sacrifice for sins cannot be the primai'j' reason for God’s justifying men and begetting them as his spiritual sons. Even the great sacrifice of Christ Jesus producing the ransom was only secondary in importance. That which stands out as of the greatest importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The force of this argument is also strong proof 'that God will not fix a secondary place in heaven for some merely to save a great multitude from destruction. Such is not expressed in the Scriptures as a reason for God’s providing a secondary reward in heaven and room for service for them to so serve. When we keep in mind that the great issue which must be settled is the vindication of Jehovah’s name all other things take their proper place in the mind, as set forth in the Scriptures. When we wait upon the Lord to interpret prophecy, then we understand it and see the real truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTER COURT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> It clearly appears from the Scriptures that there is no secondary place provided in heaven for followers taken from amongst men and made spirit creatures. It therefore also clearly appears that the outer court of the temple could not typify such a place or condition. The tabernacle in the wilderness of Mount Sinai had only one court, and that one court was trodden by all 1hc people, as well as by the Levites, priests and nonpriests. (Lev. 1:1-9) It would therefore picture the same thing as pictured by' the outer court of th-: temple, as seen in Ezekiel’s vision (Ezek. 40:17; 46:21-24), to wit: A condition of justification or standing before God of the new creatures in Chri.t, and of all those of mankind that are brought ini ) harmony with .Jehovah by Christ. The great multitude ‘stand before the throne, clothed in white robes', (hat is, they have a standing of approval before God. In the temple, as it appeared in the vision of Ezekiel, the outer court is entered and trodden by 1he prince and by the people in general (Ezek. 46:3-10), and this would prove that the outer court does not typify a spirit condition in the invisible heavens, but a condition of justification or standing before the Lord by those who are on the earth and who arc devoted to God. These are people of good will, the “other sheep” of Jesus’ flock, the “great multitude”, and will worship in the outer court. Now by reason of their faith in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and of their fleeing to God’s organization, the city of refuge, they have a standing and, there continuing faithful, they will ha\e protection, as promised, at Armageddon. Jn the tabernacle the people were excluded from the Holy, and only the piiest was permitted there; and this would prove that the Holy pictures the spirit-begotten condition of God’s people while on the earth. The Most Holy pictured heaven itself.—Heb. 9: 23,24.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WAVE OFFERING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The passover lamb was sacrificed on the fourteenth day of the first month. The fifteenth day of that month was observed as a sabbath or rest day. From the morrow after the sabbath, that is, on the. sixteenth day, the count began, and fifty davs counted from that time forward brought the people to the day of Pentecost. “And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ve brought the sheaf of the wave offering : seven sabbaths shall be complete: even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days, and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord.” (Lev. 23:1b, 1G) The “sheaf of the firstfruits of [the] harvest” (vs. 10), that is, the sheaf of the wave offering, was offered at the beginning of the fifty days.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There was a “new meal-offering” (Z?.F.). It was offered at Pentecost and consisted of two loaves baked of fine flour and baked with leaven, and this was offered together with a burnt offering: “Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves, of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord. And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish, of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rains: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the Lord. Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits, for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.”—Lev. 23:17-20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> At one time in the past this statement was published, to wit: “The two loaves represented, therefore, the two ela.s-.es of the consecrated—the oxercoming little flock and the ‘great company’ of the consecrated servants of God.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1898, page 68) In that same publication this statement was also made: “The two loaves represent[ed] the same thing as the two goats presented on the day of atonement.” The two quotations above do not appear to be consistent. The latter statement seems to be a more nearly correct one, to wit, that the two loaves represented the same thing as the two goats presented on the day of atonement. When the two goats were presented, lots were cast to show that the selection was not arbitrary but that the course of action which each goat took determined which way the lot should fall. One of those lots signified the. Lord’s goat, and the other the castaway. It showed a division of a certain class. Both goats were presented to the Lord, and were in line for sacrifice, and the Lord disposed of them according to the course of action taken by each one. One was selected for a sacrifice; the other was east away as the “evil servant”. The offering was waved before the Lord, as it appears, for the same purpose, that is to say, that the Lord might indicate his acceptance of one and the rejection of the other. In the consecration of the priesthood the offering was put on the hands of the priest and waved before the Lord. “And Hoses [picturing the Lord himself] took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering; they were consecrations for a sweet savour; it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.” (Lev. 8: 28) Thus was shown acceptance by the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Concerning the wave offering at Pentecost the record is: “Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves, of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be bakeh with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.” (Lev. 23:17) The two wave loaves, therefore, appeared to picture a dividing of those who were presented before the Lord, one part of which is wholly devoted to the Lord, and the other part or class not wholly devoted to him. Following the fulfillment of the passover the day of Pentecost marked the outpouring of the holy spirit in fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy. At that first fulfillment there was a division among those who claimed to be on the side of Jehovah God at that time: “And there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? Others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.” (Acts 2:5,12,13) After hearing Peter, many who had been in doubt were convinced and heard and believed his statement: “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”—Acts 2: 41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Now concerning the second outpouring of the holy spirit, or the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy in completeness, this occurred after the coming of the Lord to the: temple for judgment. That was the antitypieal Pentecost, or complete fulfillment. All of the consecrated were then presented before the Lord for judgment and determination as to which should receive his approval and enter into his joy. There was a division at that time. All presented were imperfect in themselves, and- this was represented by the leaven in the loaves, and not all possessed the same heart condition. Some were moved by selfishness, while others desired the approval of the Lord God above everything else and were therefore devoted to the Lord, ready and willing to do his will whatsoever that might be. There was a separation or division. This corresponded with the purifying of the sons of Levi. (Alai. 3: 2, 3) Out of that fiery test then applied came the “faithful and wise servant”, to whom the Lord committed all his kingdom interests on the earth. At the same time there appeared also the “evil serxant” class, which is not approved by the Lord. Both were in line for the kingdom when presented before the Lord, both were imperfect in themselves, as indicated by the leaven, one class was cleansed and accepted by the Lord to offer an offering in righteousness before him, and the other class xvas cast away. (Matt 2-1:45-51) On the same day of the wave offering the priest proclaimed a holy convocation and that no servile xvork should be done on that day: “And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile xvork therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.” (Lev. 23:21) Servile xvork could only be such as that done in the Devil's organization. The priests xvorking on this day of atonement xvere guiltless, and the same must be true of the great high priest and the underpricsts and of the Levites on this day.—Matt. 12: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Since the outpouring of the holy spirit upon “all flesh”, that is, all spirit-begotten ones approved by Jehovah, tliey must work in obedience to the commandment of the Lord. (Joel 2: 28,29; Acts 2:16-18) This gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed on this day, and that is their work. (Matt. 24:14) Jehovah's witnesses must see to it that on this day, the day of consecration and devotion to the Lord, they must worship God in spirit and in truth, and such worship is performed by giving obedience to the commandments of the Lord in doing his service,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>50</sup> It is reported from time to time that there are controversies among some of the companies of God’s professed people now on earth. Such is conclusive evidence that those who indulge in such controversies or strife for personal advantage arc not in fact, in the temple but are associating themselves with those who arc in the temple. Those who are devoted to God and to his kingdom should refrain from unnecessary discussions with opposers and avoid those who seek to cause divisions. (Rom. 16: 17, 18) The proper attitude of those who have come into the hoiwe of the Lord is expressed by the psalmist. (Ps. 122:1-9) All the faithful ones, priests and Levites, are standing approved in the congregation of the Lord, bearing on their foreheads the name of Jehovah, and together are singing the new song. There must be complete harmony among all of those who arc w’holly •levoted to Jehovah and in harmony with Jehovah and Christ Jems, the Higher Powers of the entire organization. Satan’s organization consists of all those who are against God and his kingdom, and Satan and Gog are the higher powers of that wicked organization. The Lord has his representatives on the earth who serve in his organization under the direction of Christ Jesus, the great High Priest. Some of these are pictured by the underpriests, and others are pictured by the others of the tribe of Levi. All are Leviti-s, but not all occupy the same place in the earthly part of God’s organization. It is written, in 1 Corinthians 12: IS: ‘‘But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.” There are no bosses in God’s earthly organization, and if anyone arbitrarily assumes to boss he is almost certain to be removed by the Lord. That docs not mean, however, that no one on eaith shall transmit the instructions of God's organization to others. We must know that the Lord is conducting his organization according to his perfect wisdom and he has his own good way of directing his work. If each and every one of the followers of Christ on earth should follow' his own course in the performance of service, tlieie would be nothing else than confusion, and that could not be according to the will of God: ‘‘For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.” (1 Cor. 14:33) There must be peace and order, and it is certain that the Lord is directing his organization and service and using those on earth according to his will. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font3"> the corporation, was organized to comply with the laws of the land that arc not contrary to God's law. The corporation and its proper operation enables God's people to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, or which the law of the land properly requires. The ‘‘Society”, as that term is generally used, consists of all of the anointed ones on earth who continue faithfully doing the Lord’s service and who engage in the orderly procedure of service. Such anointed ones, by the Lord's grace, working in a body, are enabled to render unto Jehovah the things that are God’s. The chief concern of each one is and should be to do with his might the thing to which he is assigned and to do it always as unto the Lord. “&quot;Whether therefore ye cat or drink, or whatsoever ye do. do all to the glory of God ” (1 Cor. 10:31) Doing the Lord's service in this manner, the anomted are now fulfilling in antitype that which was performed by the entire tribe of Levi in type. Those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah will not be disposed to engage in controversy, discussions and haggling as to whether or not someone in the organization is ri reiving mote or less honor than they are receiving. It is God thimigli Christ Jesus that is conducting his work, and his servant is responsible to the Loan, and the Lord will determine whether or not that person is properly rendering service. (Rom. 14:4) What differem-e does it make where one serves in the Lord’s organization? The question that should more deeply concern each one is, Am I faitiifnlly performing the service to which I am assumed, and am I loyally and faithfully maintaining my integrity toward Jehovah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font3"> The vindication of his name is the great question for final settlement. Faithfulness on the part of each servant is required, and only those who are loyal and faithful will participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. All the antitypieal Levites on the earth will be singing: “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within Ii;y gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is buikled as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony' of lsra&lt; 1, to give thanks unto the name of the land. For tin ie are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God 1 will seek thy good.”—Psalm 122.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE DAY OF GOD’S PREPARATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH GOD is preparing for battle against the enemy. There is now no possibility of preventing that great battle. God foretold it by his prophets when he directed, particularly through his prophet Jeremiah (23:21,22), that the cup of his fury should be handed to all the nations. Had the teachers of “organized Christianity’’ stood by God’s Word and caused the people to hear the divine truth, the great battle upon “Christendom’’ would have been avoided. But not now! Prophetically, God announces his decision when he directs his prophet to take the wine cup of his fury and pass it to every nation. The prophet Jeremiah writes: “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of his fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. . . . And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach [Babylon] shall drink after them.’’—Jer. 25:15-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “wine cup’’ is a symbol of the potion which Jehovah has decreed shall be drunk by all the ruling powers of the earth. “Sheshach’’ is one of the names applied to Babylon, which means the Devil’s organization, and therefore the prophecy particularly applies to “Christendom’’, so called, or “organized Christianity’’. It applies, of course, to all of the Devil’s religions, but greater responsibility is upon those who have had ample opportunity to know better. While God proceeds with this preparation, he causes notice of his purpose to be delivered to the nations. •—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By his prophet (Matt. 24:3-35) Jehovah foretold the end of the Gentile times, the end of the world, and the beginning of the reign of Christ, and stated that it would be marked by the World War, quickly followed by famines, pestilences, distress of nations, the regathering of the scattered remnant of Jehovah’s faithful servants, and the federation of the organizations of “Christendom”. The physical facts in fulfillment of this great prophecy began to come to pass in the year 1914. Between that date and 1918, Christ Jesus, the great executive officer of Jehovah, ousted Satan from heaven. Next in order thereafter is the preparation for the final battle for the destruction of Satan's organization. The evil organization that controls the nations of the earth must be destroyed before Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King, inaugurates righteousness amongst the nations of the earth. Satan is now devoting his attention to the earth, as the great Prophet Jesus foretold; and “because he knoweth that he hath but a short time”, Satan is preparing for the final battle. (Rev. 12:12; 16:14) Just when that greet battle will take place is not now revealed to man ; but because the preparations are being made, the indications are that it will come to pass in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet Nahum had a vision concerning Nineveh, the ruling city of Assyria, and he began his prophecy by saying, “The burden of Nineveh.” The word “burden” means “an utterance of doom”. His prophecy that follows relates to the day of God’s preparation for the expression of his vengeance against his enemy, and incidentally refers to Satan’s preparation also. Assyria, it will be recalled, was the Devil’s organization in which poliiies held sway, and at the same time the political element was ably supported by the commercial and religious elements. The fact that Nahum’s prophecy is directed against Nineveh, the capital city that ruled Assyria, is strongly significant that the day of preparation marks a period of time when, in the world organization, politics hold sway, and at the same time the political rulers are ably supported by Big Business and the religious elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conditions existing at the present time exactly fit the description of the prophecy. Just now it is the political rulers who are making peace pacts and treaties, and forming leagues, and declaring that they are going to make the world safe for democracy and a desirable place in which to live. In this they are ably supported by the commercial powers, which powers join in the cry of “Peace!” and at the same time are s|K*nding great sums of money to prepare for war. The claim is that the best way to prevent war is to prepare for war. In other words, the best way to prevent two men from killing each other is to arm each one of them with all the guns he can carry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the peace movements and war preparations the clergy ami religious leaders are giving their unstinted support. These religious leaders occupy high seats at the councils held for the consideration of a world arrangement to prevent war. It was in the year 1929 that the great political power restored temporal power to the head of the church of Rome, and a large sum of money was handed to the pope in connection therewith, which evidently the financiers had something to do with providing. All the facts show that the political rulers arc in the saddle, Big Business and the preachers are in the chariot, and the entire combine is moving on to the great climax. All the facts show that Nahum’s prophecy is now in course of fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision of Nahum can now be understood and is understood by those who are devoted to the Lord, because its fulfillment has begun and is progressing. The name Nahum means “comforter”, and his prophecy contains words of comfort to the people of Clod. The anointed arc told that Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power; that he will not acquit the wicked, but that he will have his own way in the. trouble, and that he has in mind those that trust him.(Nah. 1:1-7) These arc words of comfort to those who are in “the secret place of the Most High”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After these words the Lord tolls his own that he ■will make an utter end to the wicked and that affliction shall not arise the second time. (Nah. 1:8-11) The prophet tells how the elements of the enemy organization arc folded together like thorns and drunk with ambition and their own schemes, but that Clod is preparing to destroy them like stubble. The Lord then informs his people that their day of affliction is about ended, saying: “For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.” For the further encouragement of his people, Clod then tells them that the Devil’s wicked system shall be destroyed, and adds: “I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.” —Nah. 1:10-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah calls his people by the name Judah, because Judah means “praise to Jehovah”, and they praise his name; and in this connection, for the further encouragement and comfort of his own people, he says to them: “0 Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows [that is, having been brought into the covenant for the kingdom, be faithful to it] : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee.” (Nah. 1:15) The faithful remnant has been cleansed that the mc,a-bers thereof might “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”, which offering is the praise of their ’ lips and their full heart devotion to him. (Mal. 3:1-3; Ileb. 13; 15) They appreciate the fact that they' lune been taken into the covenant by sacrifice and for tlm kingdom, and joyfully perform their part. (I’ss. 50:5,14; 24:4; Rom. 12:1J This fact is another proof that whatsoever was written in the Scripturts aforetime was written for the benefit and encouragement of those who denote themselves wholly to the Lord Clod and prove faithful to him in the last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the prophet shows Jehovah preparing for the siege of the enemy and his strongholds. The fact that God foretold through his prophet the day in which Jehovah would prepare for battle is proof that the battle will be fought. The physical facts which we now see show the fulfillment of the prophecy, and are proof also that the great battle is in the very near future. Addressing those who are of Zion, which is God’s or ganization, and who are watching the fulfillment of God’s prophecy, Nahum the prophet of the Lord says: “He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face.” That means that Christ Jesus, the gie.it executive officer of Jehovah, is present and preparing the siege, which he does after casting Satan out of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another of God’s prophets describes the mighty officer of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, as the maul or war club with which he beats to pieces the enemy organization, and specifically names Babylon as that enemy. (Jer. 51:29-24) Appropriate to this same time, the Lord’s prophet Isaiah (8:9,10) says concerning the compact of the League of Nations: “Gird yourselves, and ye shall be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">broken in pieces.</span><span class="font3"> Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further addressing God's anointed ones concerning the preparation for the siege against the enemy, Nahum the prophet says: “Keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily [that is, pull yourselves together firmly]. For the Lord [Jehovah] hath turned away [from Ike enemy<sup>r</sup> country and thereby' restored] the excellency of Jacob [his people].” (Nah. 2:1, 2) God announces that his time is at hand when he will show his favor in a special manner to his anointed, and he tells them to prepare for the siege and to be of great courage. Up to this time “plunderers have plundered” tlrn^e of God’s anointed; so declares the prophecy. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jioth ) </span><span class="font3">They have “emptied out” God’s people and marred their vine branches; but now from henceforth and for ever God will protect them and keep them night and day.—Nah. 2:2; Tsa. 27:2,3; Ps. 125:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then says the prophet Nahum: “The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in the day of his preparation,</span><span class="font3"> and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.’’ (Nah. 2:3) This verse and the sulr-e-querrt verses of the prophecy have heretofore been understood and described to mean or refer to the “chariots” for rapid transportation in this day. While the words of the prophet do well describe the modern means of fast travel, yet the prophecy surely has a deeper meaning than that. That deeper meaning could not be understood until the coming of the Lord to his temple in the year 1918 and the building up of Zion, God’s organization, and not until God’s lightnings flash, illuminating the prophecy. (Mal. 3:1-3; Ps. 102: 16-18; llev. 11: 19) Instead of criticizing any interpretation heretofore given to this prophecy, rather should God’s people rejoice because of the greater illumination that the Lord puts upon it in his own due. time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of the prophecy, now illuminated by the lightnings of .Jehovah, show that they are descriptive of Almighty God’s preparation for war at Armaged</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">don. It is Jehovah who lays siege to Nineveh, the Devil’s organization. Jehovah provides the shield for his mighty men. God then tells the enemy to got ready for the siege because he is going to destroy him, Ilie enemy. He says: “Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds. . . . There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall cat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the. cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.”-** Nah. 3:14,15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophecy mentions “his mighty men”. Jehovah’s ‘mighty man’ who is commanding all his forces is the great Christ Jesus. His other “mighty men” are those who are fully and completely devoted to God as members of the army of the Lord. To Christ Jesus, the great Field Marshal, Jehovah says in the language of Psalm 45:3,4: “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 must </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mighty,</span><span class="font3"> with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of trulli and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall leach thee terrible things.” Concerning all the members of Zion, his organization, Jehovah says: “I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mighty</span><span class="font3"> men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones.”—Isa. 13:3, If.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">V.; </span><span class="font3">see also Zech. 10: 5.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE FINAL BATTLE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE final battle is called in sacred Scripture “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, —llev. 1G: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Micah the prophet had a vision of the great and terrible day of God, and he prophesied for the benefit of the people now living on earth as follows: “The word of the Lord [Jehovah] that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God bo witness against, you, the Lord from his hol.v temple. For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.” —Mic. 1:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet Laiah had a vision of this day ; and he speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ, the active agent of Jehovah, the priest of the Most High, the Field Marshal, coming forth to make war upon the Devil’s organization, and says: “Who is this that cometh from Edom [the enemy organization], with dyed garments from Boz.rah [the capital of that organization] ? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to saxe. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?” And the response to the prophet is: “For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.”—Isa. 63:1, 2, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suddenly there bursts forth a great flame of light and fire from the right hand of the little company who are singing praises to God and who are the remnant that have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah God as his witnesses, with the people of good will to God beside them. The trumpets are pealing out their terrible strains; the thunders arc rolling, the mountains are quaking and trembling, and a voice is calling from the habitation of Zion, which is Jehovah's organization. It is the God of heaven moving into battle. The great and terrible day of the Lord has come! So terrible was the vision, and so great was the effect on the ancient prophet Habakkuk, that he cried out: “0 Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: 0 Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the year's make known : in wrath remember mercy.”—Ilab. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mighty Warrior halts; and with feet planted upon the clouds of fire, as the prophet describes it, “he stood, ami measured the earth.” That is, he made a survey of the. army of the enemy, the nations of tire earth assembled against God. The prophet then says: “1 saw the tents of Cmhan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midtan did tremble.” (Ilab. 3:6,7) “Cushan” means sin-blackened, wicked oppressors of God’s people; while “Midian” means brawling, contentious, strife-breeding, fighting ones. The latter term well describes the leaders in the ecclesiastical systems, the false prophets who have blasphemed God’s holy name and stirred up strife against God’s faithful witnesses and persecuted those who tell the truth. Now they tremble at the sight of the Lord, and, as the prophet Joel (2:6) says, “all faces . . . gather blackness. ’ ’ The assembled nations see the approaching majesty and greatness of the Lord, and their faces turn colorless as they tremble for fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the mighty Leader of the army of the Lord unsheathes his sword and brings into action his instruments of destruction. The prophet (Hab. 3:5) says: “Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.’’ At the approach of these ‘the shepherds and the principal of their flocks’ smite their knees together for tear; and, being unable to give battle against any other, in blind fear they turn to battle against each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On comes the conquering Hero, the Word of God, who for centuries has waited for this very blessed hour. (Hob. 10:12,13) As prophetically described, “His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; . . . and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood.’’ (Rev. 19:12,13) But behold his apparel; it is glorious, even though covered with blood. He is treading out the winepress; he is crushing the wicked “vine of the earth’’. (Rev. 14:13-20) At his approach the mountains tremble, and the great deep utters its terrible voice and lifts up its hands to the heaven. The sun and the moon stand still in their orbits, and all the stars of the high heaven are shouting VICTORY! With righteous indignation and anger the mighty Conqueror marches through the earth to thresh the nations that have defamed Jehovah’s holy name. Jie drives asunder the nations, and their kingdoms are scattered and their high places brought low. The saints, or God's remnant on earth, do not engage in the actual combat. This is the fight of God Almighty; and the fight is led by his beloved Son, the Priest of whom Melchizedek the priestly king of ancient Salem was a type. Long aco Jehovah’s prophet recorded concerning this hour, saying: “The Lord [Jehovah] at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.’’ (Ps. 110: 5, 6) He is also fighting for the salvation of the people, that they might be delivered from the oppressor; and he is fighting for the anointed of God, that they may be vindicated for their faithful witness to the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That wicked ruling system, designated by the title “beast” and made up of profiteers, politicians and clergy, is taken. That wicked imperial system known in Scripture prophecy as the “false prophet” is also taken; and these are cast into the burning flames of everlasting destruction. (Rev. 19:20) These wicked systems fall, never to rise again. Then the Lord seizes the enemy himself, “the Dragon, that old Serpent, the Devil, and Satan,” and binds him and easts him into the bottomless pit, that he may deceive the nations no more.—Rev. 20: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus is Satan’s empire swept from the earth to oblivion. The name of Jehovah God is vindicated. But all human words attempting to describe this great and terrible day of the Lord are beggarly. Let us read the words which God caused his holy prophet long ago to record, describing his majestic and victorious march against the stronghold of Satan and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A pra.vcr of Ilabakkuk the prophet upon Shigio-noth. O Lord, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy. God came from Tenian, and the Holy One from mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his piaise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. He stood, and measured the earth; he beheld, and drove asunder the nations: and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the waler passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear. Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the [nations] in anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Thou vventest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou vvoundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages; they camo out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters. When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.”—Hab. 3:1-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this great battle no Christian will strike a blow. The reason they do not is that Jehovah has said: “For the battle is not yours, but God's.’’ To them the Lord raid further: “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.’’ (Isa. 51:16) The hand of the Lord is over his little ones; and they that trust him implicitly and will prove faithful to him are free from harm and will continue to sing his praises until the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A description of this final battle is referred to again, in the book The Ilevelation, as a ‘war between the beast and the Lamb’, in which the Lamb, Christ Jesus, is victorious, because he tights the battle on the side of Jehovah. There the record 'ays: “These [kings of the earth] shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that arc with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.”—Kev. 17:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">L&lt;*t no one deceive himself into thinking that the battle of Armageddon is a mere tight between men, or that it is only a picture. The Scriptures make it clear that it is real. Jt is the battle of God Almighty, in which he will clear the earth of the wicked syitcm that Satan has used to blind the people for all these centuries. Satan has already been ousted from heaven ; he has been cast into the earth; and now he is making a desperate attempt to destroy those who witness for God, ami to blind all others and turn them away from God. But with the end of Armageddon, when his systems have been cast into utter destruction and when he is in restraint, then will come to pass the fulfillment of the prophetic utterance long ago written concerning the Devil: “Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. Uow ait thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!”—Isa. 14:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another illustration of Armageddon is given in the battle fought by Gideon the Israelite against the great multitudes of ilidian. The Alidianites were the enemies of God’s people the Israelites. A vast multitude of these were camped in a valley. Gideon, who is a type of Christ Jesus, was directed to put them to flight. What his followers did well illustrates what the Christian’s part will be in the great and final battle.— Judges 7 and 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it came to the time of going into action Gideon had only three hundred men. These he divided into three companies, and put in each man’s hand a trumpet and an empty pitcher and a lamp within that pitcher. If is orders were that these should be stationed on three different sides of the camp of the Midianites, and that they should watch Gideon; and that when Gideon should give the command each one must blow his trumpet, break the pitcher which he held in his hands, and bold high his light and shout: “The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.” When this was done the Midianites in their fear fell upon each other and slew one another, and the army of the Midianites perished. (Jude. 7:16-22) liven so the Scriptures teach that in these closing days of the rule of wickedness and the time of the incoming of the Lord’s kingdom it is the duty and the privilege of those v.ho are really consecrated to the Lord to lift high the light of divine truth and sing the praises of Jehovah God, proclaiming the message that he is God and that Jesus Christ is the King of kings.</span></p>

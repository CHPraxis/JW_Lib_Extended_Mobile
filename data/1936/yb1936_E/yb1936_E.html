<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH GOD is the King of Eternity, the true and living God. Everything with him is orderly and done in order. Being diligent to do the will of the Most High, his witnesses earnestly endeavor to work in harmony and in complete unity. Being of God’s organization, they keep their accounts accurately and report annually, that each one may be advised of the forward movement of the witness work committed into the hands of those who love and serve God. Because the fiscal year is made to end with September 30, the annual report is made at that time. As each one studies the year’s report he will rejoice and give thanks to God that he has been permitted to have a part therein, and will earnestly and prayerfully consider how he may increase his efficiency for the service of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Christ Jesus ascended to heaven and there appeared in the presence of God he received his instructions from Jehovah, which he faithfully carries out. He was then the rightful Ruler of the world, but Jehovah’s time had not then arrived for him to begin his reign and therefore the instructions he received from Jehovah were: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord [Christ Jesus], Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A.R.P.) The enemies consist of Satan the Devil and all his -willing agents and supporters. Since Adam was expelled from Eden the Devil has held sway over wicked angels and wicked men. Since the dethronement of Zedekiah, Israel’s last king, which occurred in the year 606 B.C., Satan the chief enemy has been the god or invisible ruler of the whole world, occupying that position because Jehovah has permitted or suffered Satan to remain and to put forth his best endeavors to make good his boastful challenge to turn away men from Jehovah God. (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Looser) </span><span class="font3">In his own due time Jehovah would, as he declared, cause his name to be made known to the nations and peoples of the earth and would exercise his power against the enemy to the vindication of God’s holy name. Christ Jesus the Lord is the one appointed and commissioned to carry out Jehovah’s purpose. It is the will of God that must be done, and for that reason Jesus could not begin his reign until the due time appointed had arrived. He must wait until the time appointed for Satan and for full opportunity to carry out his boastful challenge, and then His reign should begin, and that when the enemy was still active. Because Satan the Devil has been in control for so many centuries crime and gross wickedness hold sway. “The end of the world” means the end of Satan’s rule without interruption. That end must come in due time, and the time is when God sends forth his beloved Son to reign. Until then, of course, Jesus Christ, the rightful Ruler, must wait. When that time of waiting ends Jehovah sends forth his anointed King to rule; as it is written: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion [saying] : Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. ’ '-Ps. 110: 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.'R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That long period of waiting came to an end in the autumn of 1914, and then were fulfilled the words of Jehovah: “I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.) Zion</span><span class="font3"> is the name of Jehovah’s organization. The “hill” represents the highest part; and the prophecy therefore means that Jehovah placed at the highest part, or capital, of his organization Christ Jesus the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">g of the world. It was in 1914 that Jehovah sent forth out of Zion Christ Jesus to rule and installed him as the Head and Ruler of his capital organization and his rule began. That marks the fulfillment of the prophecy as written: “Thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign, and the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came.” (Rev. 11:17,18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.')</span><span class="font3"> The wicked and rebellious Satan refused to vacate, and war in heaven immediately followed, in which war Christ Jesus and his angels, expressing Jehovah’s wrath, fought against the Devil and his angels and the Devil and his angels were defeated and cast out of heaven and down to the earth, as stated in the Divine Record at Revelation 12:7-9. Long prior thereto it was authoritatively written in God’s Word that the proof to all watchful persons on earth that the end of Satan’s world had come would be the World War, in which nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. (Matt. 24:7,8) That war came in due time, in 1914. The Devil caused that war among the nations for the purpose of destroying all mankind and to thus prevent men from having the benefit of the blessings of the Almighty God. Jehovah stopped the war and held back the expression of his own wrath for a season in order that the witnesses of Jehovah might carry the message concerning him and his kingdom to the people and nations of earth, informing them that the kingdom of Christ is here and that the Kingdom is the only hope of mankind, and that all salvation proceeds from Jehovah the Almighty God. It is then that Jehovah’s witnesses must begin to carry out the commandment written, to wit: “This gospel of the kingdom shall he preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come. ’ ’ (Matt. 24:14) Clearly this means that for a season immediately following the end of the World War, and until a fixed period of time, the Lord would cause the testimony concerning the Most High and the Kingdom to be given far and wide among the peoples and nations of the earth, and when that testimony work is done, says the Lord, “then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24:21) That great tribulation is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, otherwise called “Armageddon”.—Rev. 16:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was in the year 1918 that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messenger of Jehovah, in obedience to the will of God, came straightway to build up Zion, the capital organization, and which is called “the temple” or dwelling place of God, and through which Jehovah God deals with his creatures. “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102:16) “For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell.; for I have desired it.” (Ps. 132: 13,14) “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. ’ ’ (Matt. 25: 31) Christ Jesus appears at the temple for judgment, which means that he takes account with all those who have agreed to do the will of God. (Mal. 3:1-3) That judgment “must begin at the house of God”, meaning those who are in line for the Kingdom. (1 Pet. 4:17) That judgment resulted in gathering out and casting aside the “evil servant”, that is, a class of persons who had agreed to do the will of God and had been moved to action by reason of selfishness, and had not faithfully kept their agreement with God. That judgment also brought forth the “faithful and wise servant’’, meaning those who had agreed to do the will of God and who earnestly and faithfully endeavored to keep their covenant. “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.” —Matt. 24:45-47, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. V. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the ''faithful and wise servant” class the Lord Jesus brings into the temple of God, that is to say, into God’s organization, and anoints and commissions them to be the witnesses of Jehovah and then sends them forth through the land to give testimony before the nations of the earth. Such testimony must be given between the coming of the Lord to the temple and the day of the battle of God Almighty, or Armageddon. When such witness work is completed, according to the will of God, then the wrath of God will be expressed against all nations and peoples that have turned away from and against Jehovah and his King. Before that day of God’s wrath is expressed in the great tribulation the peoples of the nations must be informed in order that those of good will toward God may seek the Lord and his kingdom by taking their stand entirely on the side of God and serving </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3">.—Zeph. 2:2-4.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THE WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Upon whom is the obligation laid to carry the information concerning Jehovah and his kingdom to the people? Upon the company of persons whom God has taken out from the world as a people for his name. (Acts 15:14) It is that company of persons who are called out of darkness of this world, which is Satan’s organization, into the light of God’s kingdom and who must then show forth the praises of the Most High. It is the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; class, chosen of God and made into a nation or company of people wholly devoted to the Most High. To them the scripture is addressed, to wit: &quot;But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.&quot;—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Must the servant class, which is composed of God’s people, be compelled to engage in the service? No; compulsion is repugnant to Jehovah. Those who serve him acceptably must do so in the spirit of willingness prompted by unselfishness. Particularly is this true in the day of the expression of Jehovah’s power against the enemy organization, as it is written: ‘ ‘ Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power, in holy array: out of the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The words &quot;the womb of the morning&quot; here used mean the beginning of the Kingdom, that is, the birth of the Kingdom, when Christ Jesus is sent forth to reign and all those who have fully consecrated themselves to do the will of God, and who are faithful, offer themselves willingly in the service of the King. Their service is to do injury to no one, but to proclaim the truth of Jehovah’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name of Jehovah God must now be made known before he exercises his power in wrath to the destruction of Satan and his organization. The Lord Jesus Christ at the temple for judgment brings the nations before him by bringing to the attention of the nations the message of God’s truth. The people have been made blind by the fraudulent working of Satan and his agents, and now Jehovah will use his faithful witnesses whom he has taken out of the world for his name’s sake to inform the people of the truth, that they may have their eyes of understanding opened. Jehovah foretold this very day when he caused to be written these words: “Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things ? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God. Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it ? ’ ’—fisa. 43: 8-13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.B.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What is the purpose of giving the testimony among the peoples and nations of earth? Not for the benefit of Jehovah, to be sure, because no creature can bring benefit to him. Not for the purpose of converting the World, because God makes no attempt to convert the world. The purpose is, as the Scriptures state, to inform the people that Jehovah is God, the Supreme One, from whom all blessings proceed, and that he will now give all persons of good will the opportunity of intelligently taking their stand on the side of Jehovah and receiving his blessings. All who do align themselves on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom must do so willingly, and not by compulsion. Without some knowledge of Jehovah and his purpose it would not be possible for the people to take their stand on the side of the Most High and therefore receive the benefits from his kingdom. Those who hear the testimony and give heed to it are the ones who receive the blessings. Such are the ones whom Jesus described as the “sheep” class, sheep being used as a symbol of harmless and obedient ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is only those who know and obey Jehovah God that will get life everlasting; as it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) For that reason Jehovah now affords the people who desire to live the opportunity to learn the way to life. To his witnesses, the faithful servant class, Jehovah now says: “I have made thee a watchman . . . therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them [the people] warning from me.” (Ezek. 3:17) The Lord tells his witnesses to give the warning, that those to whom the warning is given may make their choice, and upon them the responsibility rests when they hear the warning. Then says the Lord that if, when they are warned by the testimony, sueh refuse to hear, then they shall themselves bear the responsibility for their own death. But if the witnesses of Jehovah fail to give the warning testimony and men die because of such failure, then, says the Lord concerning the one who thus dies, &quot;his blood will I require at thine hand,” that is, the responsibility will be upon the unfaithful witnesses. (Ezek. 3:17-21) God lays upon his witnesses the obligation to give that testimony as commanded. Is not this the same as compelling the servant to serve him by giving testimony? No. The punishment comes upon the unfaithful servant who fails to obey because that servant has made a solemn covenant or agreement to do the will of Jehovah God and then fails or refuses to carry out his agreement, and thus shows himself a covenant-breaker and not worthy of life; and it is written in God's law that such covenant-breaker is worthy of death. (Rom. 1: 31, 32) The punishment is inflicted upon the witness because of his disobedience to the commandments of the Lord. He was not compelled to enter into the covenant, but having voluntarily entered into it he must keep it by faithfully performing. The same rule is announced in Acts 3: 23 to the effect that all who do not obey the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s great Prophet, shall be destroyed from amongst the people. Those willingly and voluntarily undertaking to follow Christ are in line for the kingdom of God and must fully comply with the law of the Kingdom if they would receive the blessings thereof. “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” (Luke 9:62) This illustration shows that one is not compelled to start to follow Christ Jesus, but, having once started, he must continue faithful in the performance of his agreement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has budded up his capital organization, which must do his will. That organization is designated under the title “Zion”, the budding up of which begins at the second coming of Christ Jesus, as afore stated. That organization is now built up, and Christ is the Head thereof and is designated under the symbol of Chief Corner Stone. His faithful apostles, now resurrected and with the Lord in heaven, are the twelve foundation pidars of that organization. He having now come to the temple and gathered the faithful unto himself, those on the earth who are. wholly devoted to Jehovah, and who have been anointed and given a place in the temple, are members and earthly representatives of God’s organization. The entire organization is at unity, or one, that is to say, in complete harmony, acting always under the direction of the Head, Christ Jesus. It is written concerning Christ Jesus, the Head, that he says: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8) His faithful followers must be -of the same mind. All those of the temple must delight to do the will of God and pursue the same course that Jesus pursued. (1 Pet. 2: 21) The time has now come for the fulfillment of the words that Jesus uttered concerning those who have been taken out of the world as witnesses for Jehovah, to wit: ‘‘That they all may be one 3 as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in' us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.” (John 17:21) They are all one, having one objective, and that is to magnify the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the end that the people may be informed and have an opportunity to believe on the Lord and his kingdom Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to his commandments carry forward the testimony and present it before the people. For this purpose the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Peoples Pulpit Association, and the International Bible Students Association were and are incorporated to meet the requirements of the law of the land in carrying forward the witness work in which the united company of Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged. The witnesses of Jehovah preach this good news of the Kingdom by public and private speech, by the use of the radio, transcription machines, sound cars, phonographs, printed magazines, books and booklets, and by carrying these from house to house and using them to publish to the people the truth, that they might hear and have an opportunity to believe and take their stand on the right side. These witnesses are not trying to increase the number in any so-called “church” organization, but are merely obeying God’s commandment to bring these truths to the attention of the people, and that for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>GOOD WILL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At the time of the birth of Jesus Christ, the “man child”, the messengers sent from heaven announced in the presence of watching witnesses these words: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of good will.” (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> This does not mean peace amongst the nations of the earth, nor peace amongst individuals of the world in general. The nations are not of good will toward God, and not very many men are of good will toward him: Manifestly this message from heaven means the peace which God gives to those who devote themselves to him. It is written: ‘' Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Rom. 5:1) This text applies to the spiritual class, who enter the race for a place in the Kingdom. All men, by reason of original sin, are at enmity with God, and it is only when a man exercises faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus and consecrates himself fully, agreeing to do the will of God, that he then receives the peace of God. (Phil. 4:7) When one by faith and consecration devotes himself to God and his organization, and the enmity of God toward that person is removed, he is then at peace with God. Such are the persons of good will, but are not in line for membership in the royal house. The announcement by the angelic host at the birth of Jesus, therefore, means peace on earth from God toward those who are of good will toward Jehovah. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophetic drama which clearly foreshadowed this class of persons of good will is recorded at 2 Kings 10:15-23. Jehu was devoted to Jehovah God. He was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, the executioner of Jehovah. During the performance of his official duties he found Jonadab, and Jehu said to Jonadab: “Is thine heart right?” And Jonadab answered, &quot;It is.” That meant that as Jehu was on the side of Jehovah God, such was the heart desire of Jonadab also. Then Jehu invited Jonadab to ride with him in his chariot that he might observe Jehu’s zeal for Jehovah, meaning his unselfish devotion to Jehovah. In brief, this man Jonadab pictured the class of persons who come in contact with Christ Jesus, the Greater Jehu, and who is represented on the earth by the anointed witnesses of Jehovah. From such they hear the message of the Kingdom, and believe it, and desire to obey the Lord and King. Because their heart is right toward him they seek the Lord. Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Jehu, invites such persons of good will to join themselves to Jehovah’s witnesses and be their companions in service. Those who do so thus show good will toward God and Christ Jesus, and they then receive and have peace with God. They become the companions of the anointed class, that is to say, the companions of the “virgins” class, and are described in the Scriptures as “the virgins her companions that follow her”.—Ps. 45:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year just passed Jehovah, by Christ Jesus at the temple, has made known to those devoted to him that the “great multitude” is not a company of spirit creatures that will have their eternal habitation in heaven; but that the “great multitude” and the Jonadabs are one and the same class. The description of the “great multitude” and the attitude thereof is stated in this language: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7: 9,10) The place of the great' multitude is on the earth, and their standing is before the throne of Christ Jesus, and there they are approved, and this is shown by the faet that they are clothed with white robes, a symbol of approval, and they hail the King, who is the Redeemer of man, and ascribe salvation to God and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great multitude is that same class which Jesus describes as his “other sheep”. “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:16) When Jesus Christ appeared at the temple in 1918 for judgment, that judgment began with those in line for the kingdom; and then he devotes himself to the other sheep: “And before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matt. 25: 32-34) The work of separating the sheep from the goats is now in progress, and that work during the year 1935 has progressed to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are assigned a certain duty to be performed by them while the Lord is thus separating the sheep from the goats. The assigned duty of Jehovah’s witnesses is to publish the message concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom and to proclaim that Jehovah is God, and this work they do with great joy. The Lord foretold this work through his prophet, to wit: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publish-eth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.” —Isa. 52: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time has now begun during which time “all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God”. (Isa. 52:10) Jehovah’s witnesses must bear the message of the Kingdom before the nations before the final end, which comes in the expression of Jehovah’s wrath. This they must do, because God has taken them out of the world for that very purpose. Their salvation now depends upon their faithfulness in doing what God has commanded them to do. That is the reason why the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its associate organizations now carry forward the work that is being done. Jehovah’s witnesses, anointed and sent forward by the Lord, constitute the visible part of God’s organization on earth, and the Jonadabs, or “great multitude”, have joined themselves to God’s organization by participating with the-anointed in doing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Jonadab company must be obedient to the Lord. To those who are of his organization the Lord now says: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) The bride here mentioned is made up of those who compose the royal house of the Lord, and these are the ones that proclaim the message of truth before the Jonadabs, and the Jonadabs are the ones who hear that message; and when they hear, the commandment is given to them in these words: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” Thus the Jonadabs join with Jehovah’s witnesses in informing the people that the water of life, which flows from the throne of God, is free to all who will conform themselves to the rules of the Lord’s kingdom. To the Jonadabs, or great multitude, the promise of the Lord is that if they continue faithful they may be hid during the time of Armageddon and pass through that time of great tribulation, and live for ever on earth, and never die. That is the reason why it can now be truthfully said that ' 'millions now living will never die”. They will live on the earth, and God will make the earth a fit and beautiful place in which to live.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>OPPOSING ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Satan the Devil has been the invisible god or ruler of this world. ‘The whole world lieth in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19) Satan’s organization is extremely wicked and always aets in opposition to Jehovah. It was Satan who raised the question of supremacy as between himself and Jehovah, and now that question must be settled finally. Satan declared his ability to turn all men away from God, and now the final test is on to show that Satan is a liar and God is true. The success of Jehovah’s ■organization under Christ means the complete annihilation of Satan’s organization. There is a deadly conflict between the two organizations. All reasonable and thinking persons will discern at once that everything done by Jehovah’s organization under Christ is and will be opposed by Satan and his organization. Getting this truth fixed well in mind, it is easy to see why Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted. The organization of Satan the Devil is made up as follows: The Devil is the head thereof, and associated with him is a host of wicked angels, all invisible to human eyes. On the earth the organization of men into governments is controlled and operated contrary to the will of Jehovah God, and therefore they are under the influence and control of Satan and do his bidding, whether men are aware of that fact or not. The three controlling elements of the visible or earthly part of Satan’s organization are these: Religion, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with which are associated the so-called “Protestant” preachers, Jewish rabbis, and the principal of their respective flocks, and the simple ones that follow them. Supporting the religious element is that element which controls commerce, the chief men of whom employ religion as a camouflage to carry on their selfish business; and the third element is the political office-holders, who do the bidding of the commercial giants and hence are allies of the religionists. These three elements of Satan’s visible organization employ and control the public press so that their propaganda may be carried on according to their own ideas. For this reason the newspapers publish only one side of any controversy and refuse to publish the other side, and particularly any part thereof that discloses the truth of God’s Word. By this means the public press is a great instrument to keep the people blind to the truth. Every part of that organization is fighting against God and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy operates particularly through its secret order of Jesuits and has seized control of many nations, including Italy, Austria, Germany and other countries, and for years has desperately attempted to get complete control of the United States of America. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is in fact a political organization, and employs religious ceremonies and sails under a religious name in order to blind the people concerning its real purpose. That organization is extremely selfish, cruel and grossly wicked. Pretending to represent God and his kingdom on earth the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in fact represents the Devil and is therefore the greatest hypocritical organization on earth. It follows the course of its father the Devil in deceiving the people and blinding them to the truth. The best evidence that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief instrument of the Devil on earth is the fact that it constantly engages in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, because those witnesses bear the message of the truth of God’s kingdom to the people. The chief men in the commercial and political part of the organizations on earth have been made the principal men of the religious flocks. (Jer. 25: 34, 35) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by sly and subtle schemes, induces the political and commercial elements to do injury to Jehovah’s witnesses and to this end induces the political element to make laws to carry out selfish schemes for the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and opposition to the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year 1935 the Roman Catholic Hierarchy induced the legislative bodies of some of the states, including Massachusetts, to enact a law requiring school teachers and pupils to salute the flag of the United States at regular intervals. All sensible persons will see that there is no necessity for such a procedure. Honest persons do not have to be required to swear their allegiance to the law of the land. They obey the law willingly. The purpose of the modern flag-saluting business is to single out those who are devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom and to bring them into disrepute by persecuting them because of their faithfulness. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy know that Jehovah’s witnesses are lawabiding persons and that they can find no occasion against them except by reason of their devotion to God. The Devil is the father of that scheme, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief instrument of the Devil to put the scheme into operation. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by this means, expects and intends to plant fear in the minds of the people and cause the people to remain quiet while the Hierarchy grabs control of the United States government and rules it by the hand of a vicious dictator, exactly as it now rules the German people. This is a part of the Devil’s scheme to cause all men to curse God and turn away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are devoted to Jehovah God have no objection, of course, to any person’s saluting any flag that such person desires to salute. Jehovah’s witnesses insist that this is a personal privilege of each and every one. The saluting of or salutation to a flag means this: “I depend upon what that flag represents for my salvation. ’ ’ Those who know and serve God in spirit and in truth look to Jehovah God for salvation, and not to any man or any man-made organization. It therefore follows that the saluting of any flag by those who are in a covenant with Jehovah God to do his will constitutes the breaking of that covenant with God, and such covenant-breakers are guilty of death.—Rom. 1: 31,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently a schoolboy of eight years, a son of one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was singled out to be used as a means of persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses and to thereby put fear into the minds of other people. That young boy was directed to salute the flag. He declined to do so, stating that he served Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and therefore could not salute any flag. The public press, which is the tool and publicity arm of the Devil’s visible organization, published throughout the land the fact that the young boy had refused to salute the flag; that he is a son of one of Jehovah’s witnesses; and that the Department of Justice of the United States is investigating the attitude of Jehovah’s witnesses. A like announcement was made public over the radio by those under the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Thus The Associated Press and the other means of propaganda by the Hierarchy published throughout the land just enough, and no more, to bring Jehovah’s witnesses into the limelight in an undesirable attitude. Then The Associated Press requested the president of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to issue a statement of the attitude of Jehovah’s witnesses and the reason therefor. That statement was furnished, getting forth the position of the followers of Christ Jesus, but the press declined publication of the same because it stated the truth and exposed the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is back of the flagsaluting scheme, and that its purpose is to mislead the people and to withhold from the people its cruel purpose of seizing the United States government. In order that the position of Jehovah’s witnesses might be plainly stated the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, on the 6th day of October, 1935, broadcast its position over a chain of fourteen .radio stations, to which radio stations the commercial rate was paid, in order to get this truth before the people. Thus Jehovah’s witnesses, at a money sacrifice to themselves, attempted to aid the people in hearing the truth, and the public press throughout the country not only attempted to prejudice all the people against Jehovah’s witnesses but refused to publish the statement showing the side of Jehovah’s witnesses. This shows their unfairness and that they do not desire the people to know the truth, and that Satan’s entire organization, as above described, follows his own course of resorting to lies, fraud and misrepresentation to keep the people in ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That a record may be kept of the position Jehovah’s witnesses occupy, as defined in the Scriptures, that radio broadcast is set forth as a part of this report, to wit:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>SALUTING </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a flag</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">[Broadcast over chain October 6, 1935, by Judge Rutherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently much publicity has been given to the ease of Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., a schoolboy of tender years, who declined to salute the American flag and sing “America”. He is the son of one of Jehovah’s 'witnesses. The Associated Press has requested me to express my view of the matter. This I do from the standpoint of a true follower of Christ Jesus. To many persons the saluting of the flag is merely a formalism and has little or no significance. To those who sincerely consider it from the Scriptural standpoint, it means much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The flag representatively stands for the visible ruling powers. To attempt by law to compel a citizen or child of a citizen to salute any object or thing, or to sing so-called “patriotic songs”, is entirely unfair and wrong. Laws are made and enforced to prevent the commission of overt acts that result in injury to another, and are not made for the purpose of compelling a person to violate his conscience, and particularly when that conscience is directed in harmony with Jehovah God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The refusal to salute the flag, and to stand mute, as this boy did, could injure no one. If one sincerely believes that God’s commandment is against the saluting of flags, then to compel that person to salute a flag contrary to the Word of God, and contrary to his conscience, works a great injury to that person. The State has no right by law or otherwise to work injury to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Satan the Devil has been the invisible ruler of the nations of the earth. God has suffered or permitted him to so act in order to put a test upon the human race to determine how many will serve God willingly and how many will serve the Devil. For that reason Jehovah God gives this commandment to those who will receive His favor (Ex. 20:3, 5): “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the third chapter of Daniel the Divine Record states that in violation of God’s law the government of Babylon made a law commanding all persons, when the national hymn was played, to fall down and worship before a certain image and that those who refused would be put to death in a fiery furnace. Three Hebrews who had covenanted to serve Jehovah God refused to obey that commandment and said to the king: ‘We have no need to obey you in this matter; and if it be that you cast us into the fire, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace; and he will deliver us.’ The test was on. The three Hebrews were cast into the furnace; and because of their faithfulness God delivered them, and thus put his disapproval upon the emblem-saluting law of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present-day attempt to compel school children and others who believe in and serve Jehovah God to salute any flag or sing any song is exactly in line with the Babylonish law just mentioned. To salute a flag means, in effect, that the person saluting ascribes salvation to what that flag represents, whereas salvation is of Jehovah God. The Hitler government, a stench in the nostrils of all honest people, requires all persons of Germany to give a certain salute and to cry out, “Heil Hitler!” and those who refuse to do so are severely punished. At the present time more than twelve hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison in Germany because of the commission of the ‘grave offense’ of declining to shout, “Heil Hitler!” They trust in Jehovah God and in Christ Jesus, and not in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are men and women who have fully pledged themselves to obey the commandments of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. They fully comply with the commandment of Jesus, who said: &quot;Render therefore unto Cesar the things which be Cesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s?’ (Luke 20:25) The meaning of that declaration of Jesus is this: Jehovah God is supreme, and his law is above all human laws. “Csesar” stands for the state or human law. All laws of the state or government that are not in conflict with God’s law should be gladly obeyed by all who are devoted to Jehovah God. When the law of man is in conflict with the law of Jehovah, then the Christian cannot obey that law of man. The apostles of Christ Jesus placed this exact construction upon the words of Jesus. In answer to charges of violating the law of the province or state they said to the high court: “Whether it be right in the sight of God [for us] to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. ... We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 4:19; 5:29) Jehovah’s witnesses take that same stand. They gladly obey every law of the land that is not in conflict with God’s law. But when the law of man is in direct conflict with God’s law, they cannot and will not comply therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is written, at Romans 13:1: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers”; and many wrongfully hold that “the higher powers” are the visible rulers of the nations of earth. This scripture is addressed to the followers of Christ Jesus, and to no others, and “the higher powers” are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and every true follower of Christ Jesus must obey God in preference to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The flag of the United States is not the flag of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. It is the emblem of the power that rules the nation; and no one can truthfully say that God and Christ Jesus rule a government where crime is rampant. Men have organized governments, and Satan the Devil overreaches men and rules them because of their refusal to obey God, and hence the nations of the world are under the control of Satan the Devil, as stated at 1 John 5:19: “We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil one.’’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Weym.)</span><span class="font3"> In proof of this, mark the words of Jesus. That the Devil is the invisible ruler of the world, note this from the Bible: Satan took Jesus up on a high mountain, and, being the god of this world, he showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and offered to give them to Jesus upon condition that Jesus would fall down and worship the Devil. Jesus refused and said (Matt. 4:10): “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In further proof, Jesus, at John 12:31, stated that Satan is the prince or invisible ruler of this world. At John 18: 36, he said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” Jesus directed his followers to pray to God saying (Matt. 6: 9-12): ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven. ’ At 2 Corinthians four it is written that Satan is the god of this world and deceives and blinds the people to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are true followers of Christ Jesus and must obey his commandments. To them the Lord says (John 15:19): “Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of •the world, therefore the world hateth you.” At John 8:23: “I am not of this world.” At John 14: 21: “He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.” Concerning his followers it is written in the Scriptures (Phil. 3:20): ‘For our citizenship is in heaven.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> At 1 John 5: 21: “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” At 1 Corinthians 10:14: ‘Wherefore, my beloved brethren, flee from idolatry.’ This commandment is based upon the commandment at Exodus 20; 4, 5.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>FATE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are in a solemn covenant or agreement to obey God and Christ Jesus, and for them to break that covenant means their destruction, as it is written, in Romans 1: 31, 32, that “covenant breakers . . . are worthy of death”. At Acts 3:23 they are told that every one who does not obey Christ shall be destroyed. &quot;When Jesus was about to be put to death the Roman governor pointed to Jesus and said to the Jews, “Behold your King”; and the Jews answered, “We have no king but Cassar. ” (John 19: 14,15) They were in a covenant to obey God. Their repudiation of their covenant resulted in their destruction. The question to each of Jehovah’s witnesses therefore is: “Shall I obey every command of man and die, or shall I obey Jehovah God and live?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect or cult. They are true followers of Christ Jesus. The Bible is their only creed. God has given them a banner or flag, and that is his message of truth, as stated in Psalm 20: 5. Jehovah commands his witnesses to “lift up a standard for the people” (Isa. 62:10), meaning that his witnesses must raise God’s standard of truth and point to that as the only salvation of man. Every nation has a different standard; and therefore none of these are God’s standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Pilgrim fathers left the oppressive nations in Europe, and landed in New England, because of their sincere desire to be free to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. It now appears that in Massachusetts, the very cradle of American liberty, an oppressive rule is attempted to be enforced that takes away the liberty of the citizen to worship God as God has commanded that man shall worship. The government or state is wholly inconsistent and unfair in compelling citizens to salute the flag. No one is injured by a man conscientiously serving God as he is commanded by the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses are thoroughly devoted to God and Christ Jesus, and they will obey the laws of God always, and will obey the laws of the state or nation that are not contrary to God’s law. No government has a right to compel a man to violate God’s law in which he conscientiously and implicitly trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Supreme Court of the United States, in Church vs. United States, 143 U. S. 457, authoritatively ruled that the American government is a Christian nation. If the nation is standing by that ruling of the Supreme Court, then the nation must recognize the law of God as superior to the law of man, and where the two are in conflict the Christian must obey the law of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the ships that ply the sea the Roman Catholic service is held. At that service the flag of the pope is displayed above the flag of the United States. The United States Senate went on record, in February, 1929, as favoring the right of the flag of the pope to be thus displayed, and this appears in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record</span><span class="font3"> No. 47, page 2851. In that instance the senator from Massachusetts took the position that the flag of the pope is the flag of God. I wholly disagree with him in that regard; but giving him credit for believing that the flag of the Catholic church is the flag of God his words are appropriate. He said: “I for one refuse to depart from the time-honored American custom of placing the emblem of God above every other emblem of the world. I will not run down the pennant of God for any other emblem.” The Senate, by a vote of 68 to 10, sustained the senator in that position. The United States government is therefore estopped from saying that the flag of the United States should be honored above Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most important question before the peoples of earth now is, Whom do you choose to serve, Jehovah or Satan the Devil? The crisis is here because the end of the Devil’s reign is at hand. Soon Christ Jesus tvill destroy all of the Devil's organization visible and invisible, and that includes all who take their stand on the side of the Devil. Each person must choose for himself. There can he no compulsion on either side. As for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will serve and obey Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a great pity for the people who attend the churches that their clergymen fail to teach them the truth of God’s Word. For their neglect the clergymen are doubly responsible. Today the combined church organization celebrates “loyalty day”. Do they mean loyalty only to man? If entirely loyal to God they do harm to no one. To compel the saluting of the Hag, thereby saying in symbol, “We look to the flag for salvation,” is doing great harm to man and reproaching the name of Jehovah God.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Baltimore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun</span><span class="font3"> editorially expresses the true American sentiment in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;For our part, we glory in Carleton’s spunk. Any statute requiring that the flag be saluted by school children is an insult to the Stars and Stripes, and ought to be resented by all patriots. Is our national ensign a swastika flag, to be respected only by forced salutes? Since when has the Star-Spangled Banner so lost the respect of the people over whom it flies that laws are necessary to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mak</span><span class="font2">e them pretend to honor it? What a disgraceful thing it is to assume that the flag would not be saluted if people were not afraid to refuse the tribute of respect I ... It is supposed to float because its people have raised it of their own free will and uphold it out of preference—not because they fear it, but because they love it. If the time has come when they must be compelled to pay it a formal and forced tribute, then the time has come to-haul it down and hoist in its place some red or black banner of dictatorship of force and fear.”—Baltimore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun </span><span class="font2">of September 28, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Nichols lad has been taught by his parents to serve and obey Jehovah. He has made a wise choice, declaring himself for Jehovah God and his kingdom of righteousness. All who act wisely will do the same thing. The great multitude that serves God is revealed as saying: “Salvation [salutation] to our God, which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the [Christ].”— Rev. 7 : 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Real American citizens who love the principles of the Bill of Rights and the fundamental law of the land, who believe in freedom of thought and freedom of speech, and, above all, in the right of man to worship God. according to the dictates of his own conscience, will commend the lad, Carleton B. Nichols, Jr., for the bold stand he has taken for Jehovah. It is foolish to attempt to make good citizens by compelling them to act as hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For more than 150 years honest Americans have obeyed the law without being compelled to salute the flag. Why the burning zeal to now compel flag-saluting ? The reason is this, and once again I warn the American people, that the same power that caused Fascism and Hitlerism to seize governments in Europe is moving to seize control of the American institutions, and the policy of compulsory flag-saluting is but a part in that program to put fear into the minds of the people and compel submission to an arbitrary dictator. One mighty religio-political organization is back of the entire program. That organization is not the honest Catholic population, but it is the Roman Catholic .Hierarchy, operating from Rome, in its determination to rule the whole earth. It has its political ambassadors in almost all countries. On March 8, 1934, a special cable dispatch from Rome to the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font3"> states that a definite agreement has been reached by President Roosevelt and the Vatican and that diplomatic relations shall be established between the United States and the “Holy See” as soon as public opinion in America can be brought around to the idea. Compulsory saluting of the flag is in line with Hitlerism and a part of the studied, diabolical effort to bring the people around to the Roman idea. It is high time that the loyal and faithful American people realized this great peril. True and honest men of America, in which class Jehovah’s witnesses are included, do not need shotgun methods or prisons to compel them to do what is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public press is a part of Satan’s visible organization and does the bidding of that organization. It is the desire of the Devil and his agents to prevent the people from knowing the following salient facts, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the United States Supreme Court has officially decided that the law of God is higher than the law of the nation because God is supreme, and that the American government assumes to be a Christian nation; and that in harmony therewith Jehovah’s witnesses have properly construed and applied the law of man and God, that is to say, the Christian must obey God’s law first, and must refuse to obey any law of man that is in conflict with God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the United States Senate by an overwhelming vote has decided that the flag of the Catholic church is superior to the flag of the United States, and therefore that during the papal service the flag of the pope should be displayed on the American battleships above the American flag and given preference thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That President Roosevelt has assured the pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that the United States government will enter into diplomatic relations with the Hierarchy as soon as the American people can be brought around to see it that way; that the flag-saluting is a part of the scheme of the Devil and the Hierarchy to put fear into the minds of the people and bring them around to the point of agreeing that diplomatic relationship with the Vatican is the proper thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the position taken by Jehovah’s witnesses concerning flag-saluting is the proper and Scriptural one </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">fin</span><span class="font3">d in harmony with the law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the people could come to know and understand these things it would interfere with the scheme of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to seize control of the American government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As further proof that the public press does not publish the truth but willingly resorts to lies in an attempt to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, mark the following: After the broadcast aforesaid, setting forth the position of Jehovah’s witnesses concerning flag-saluting, and after the press had been furnished, at its request, with a complete copy of that speech, it refused to publish the speech, but in its very next issue did publish the untrue statement that the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society had ordered a strike in the vicinity of Boston concerning flag-saluting. Not only is that published statement untrue, but it is a deliberate lie published for the purpose of bringing reproach upon Jehovah’s witnesses and furnishing further excuse for their persecution. The president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society has no power to call a strike concerning flag-saluting, has not done so, and will not do so. On the contrary, the position of Jehovah’s witnesses is plainly stated in his speech to the effect that saluting the flag is an individual matter that each one must decide for himself, and that the true follower of Christ Jesus cannot consistently salute any flag, because by doing so he attributes salvation to what the flag represents, whereas salvation proceeds from God alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has induced and caused the persecution, the arrest and imprisonment of many of Jehovah’s wit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">nesges, and continues to do so. In New Jersey and other, states many of Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned on the charge of distributing literature without a permit from the police, the issuance of which permit rests within the discretion of police officers. One who has covenanted to do the will of Jehovah must obey his commandments and therefore could not ask a permit of some earthly creature to do what Almighty God has commanded shall be done. The duty of the Christian is to obey God’s commandments. It is also his duty to obey the laws of the land as long as such laws do not conflict with God’s law. The law of the land is that men shall ask a permit to go from house to house with literature, and the law of God is directly in conflict therewith, which means that those in a covenant with him shall go from house to house with the message or gospel of the Kingdom and tell it to others and present it to them in printed form. The question is not one to be debated hy the followers of Christ Jesus, because they must obey God first and all the time. The apostles of Jesus Christ were arrested because they went about the city from place to place preaching the gospel, and when arrested they construed God’s law exactly as here stated. A court before whom they appeared instructed the apostles that they must not teach in the name of Jesus Christ: “But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.’’ (Acts 4:15-19) “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) Such is the correct position that must be taken by all followers of Christ Jesus. For this reason they could not ask a permit of an imperfect man to do what God has commanded them they must do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s great Prophet, of whom Moses was a type. Jesus utters the commandment of Jehovah God with absolute authority. To those in a covenant with God Jesus commands: &quot;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The true followers of Christ Jesus will not stop to ask the question as to whether they shall preach this gospel of the Kingdom, but will gladly obey the commandment at the risk of their earthly lives. It is far better to puffer indignities and punishment at the hands of men than to disobey God and be destroyed. Those who do refuse to obey the commandments of the Lord shall suffer destruction, as stated: &quot;It shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:23) The opposition of Satan’s organization, therefore, cannot be permitted to deter faithful men and women who follow Christ Jesus in doing their duty as commanded by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Quebec, which is ruled and ridden by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, Jehovah’s witnesses during the year have been arrested, tried, and convicted of the &quot;crime of seditious conspiracy”. The facts upon which such conviction was obtained are these: That Jehovah’s witnesses went throughout the city of Quebec and distributed freely to the people without charge booklets containing the message of God’s kingdom, and which message, including the words of the prophets and Christ Jesus, exposed the wickedness of Satan’s organization. Those truths angered the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and in order to give vent to their cruel hatred they caused the arrest, prosecution and conviction of those faithful witnesses of the Lord. Thus the Hierarchy has kept the people of Quebec in ignorance of the truth and continues to prevent them from understanding the truth. If the Lord Jesus Christ were in Quebec today he would be imprisoned and would be crucified, because he would continue to proclaim the message of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Germany the Watch Tower Bibee &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society work has been completely destroyed, although individuals of Jehovah’s witnesses still continue to tell the truth. In that land hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses are imprisoned, and some brutally killed, because they attempt to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and the apostles and proclaim the Kingdom, which is the only hope of mankind. Furthermore, for meeting together in their own houses for the study of the Bible these witnesses of Jehovah are arrested and thrown into prison, and this is done at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. There is not one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany that is harmful. His only offense is being faithful to the Lord. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy organized in Germany the Communists and used that organization as a scarecrow to put fear into the minds of the people, and then the Roman Catholic Hierarchy brought into existence the Nazis and with that organization seized control of Germany and put one Hitler up as absolute dictator. The real power behind Hitler is the Jesuit organization of the Hierarchy. In Germany it is now a high crime to refuse to salute the swastika and cry out “Heil, Hitler!’’ To be sure, no one who is in a covenant with Jehovah God will give that salute and cry out “Heil, Hitler!” because it means “Salvation by Hitler”, whereas salvation is of God through Christ Jesus, and there is no other way whereby men might be saved.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is easy to be seen that the peoples of this world are under the Devil’s control and the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses continues solely because they are proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom that is in opposition to the Devil’s organization. But persecution has not deterred and will not deter the faithful witnesses of Jehovah. They are not at all surprised or alarmed by reason of such persecution. Long ago Jesus foretold this very time. He said to his faithful followers: &quot;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year of 1935 the Lord has graciously made known to his people the meaning of many of the prophecies, including that of Habakkuk, which show the reason why much persecution is now in progress against Jehovah’s witnesses, and also exactly what shall be the result. This persecution gives Jehovah’s witnesses an opportunity to prove their faithful devotion to God and to maintain their integrity, and permits those of the Devil’s organization to don their vestments and so identify themselves for destruction at the hand of the Lord. In all this time of stress Jehovah God, true to his promise, feeds his people upon the food convenient for them. (Prov. 30:8) Amidst this cruel persecution Jehovah has abundantly sustained his people and has blessed them richly. Endeavors to make known his name and his kingdom have been faithfully carried on by his witnesses and their efforts have been greatly blessed, and this will appear from the examination of the facts and figures set forth herein. Jehovah’s witnesses delight to be on his side and rejoice that they are privileged to bear some of the taunts and jeers and persecution and sufferings that came upon Christ Jesus and which to them is an assurance that if they continue faithful they shall for ever rejoice and be with the Lord in carrying out the purposes of the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It has pleased Jehovah to permit his servants in the United States of America to direct the witness work throughout the nations of the earth in giving publication to this gospel of the kingdom. The place is not so important, but whatsoever the Lord does and directs is important. At 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, is the chief executive office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society; and at 117 Adams street is the operating office and place for the manufacture of the literature and other instruments for the publication of the Kingdom message. Branch offices are established in various countries of the earth, and these report at regular intervals of thirty days to the main office, and at the end of the fiscal year furnish a comprehensive report of the activities in those respective countries. It is the duty and privilege of the president of the Society to receive these reports and then to make a general report to all the witnesses throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will be observed that in this report those who direct the work at the various branch offices are no longer called “managers”, but it is deemed advisable to designate them “directors of service”. There is one manager of the campaign, and that is the Lord himself. All others in the organization merely repeat organization instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Engaged in the Society’s work at its American headquarters are 195 persons. Living accommodations and food must be furnished to each and every one of these, together with a small allowance of cash for personal expenses, all of which goes for their actual tnaintenanfee. The service of each one is donated and gladly performed; each one counts it a great privilege to be permitted to have any part in the service of the Lord in making known his kingdom. The amount received by each and every one is the same, so that there is no respect of persons shown, all in the Lord’s organization being on a common level.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>MONEY STATEMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are in opposition to the truth and therefore in opposition to the Society’s work are more deeply concerned and disturbed about the money that is necessary to carry on the Society’s work than are those who are actually engaged in the service. The Society and its servants receive money only in the capacity of trustees for the use and benefit of the work of the Lord’s kingdom. The money is paid out to carry on the work of forwarding the message of the Lord’s kingdom and is used in the most economical way possible. The money that is received belongs to the Lord, and his servants at headquarters must use the best means known to accomplish the greatest amount of possible good in the most economical use of such money. The books, booklets and other literature of the Society are placed in the hands of the people solely for the purpose of imparting to the people the information concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom, and therefore all money received by those placing the literature in the hands of the people is received as a donation to be used, and is used, to further the publication of the Kingdom message. No one of the Society engaged in its work makes any pecuniary or money profit. Only actual expenses are paid by the Society to those engaged in the service, and often many of those engaged in the service pay their own expenses, of which we have no account. Below is given a statement of the amount of money received during the fiscal year ending September’ 30, 1935, and the amounts expended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of the fiscal year of 1934 there was a deficit of $149,955.42. At the beginning of the fiscal year of 1935 this deficit was wiped off by voluntary contributions, and the fiscal year of 1935 began with a cash balance of $35,108.42. Therefore the following statement in brief of the money transactions of the Society during the fiscal year of 1935:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cash balance on hand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$35,108.42</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Those who oppose the promulgation of the message of Jehovah’s kingdom insist that the work of the Society is commercial. Such is entirely contrary to the facts. Commerce is the carrying on of traffic or trade for the purpose of making a pecuniary or money profit to those engaged in -the business. There is no person in the Society of Jehovah’s witnesses that makes any pecuniary profit. The service of each and every one is voluntary and is given and rendered as a privilege to those who serve God. As long as money or coin is used as a measure of value in the world and the Lord’s people are in the world, although not of it, all raw materials and other necessities used by the Society must-be bought and paid for in this medium of exchange, and for that purpose money is had by contributions, as above stated. Those who have a keen interest in and love for Jehovah’s kingdom contribute their money as the Lord prospers them. There is no thought of money gain to anyone. All those engaged in the service of the Society do so at a money sacrifice to themselves rather than a profit. In order to provide, at the least possible cost, the food necessary for the Bethel family, who do the work at the Society’s headquarters, gardens are cultivated and thus a food supply is produced. None of such food is sold to the public, but all that is produced is consumed by those who are engaged in the Lord’s service. Those doing the work in the gardens or fields do so on the same terms and according to the same arrangement as those at the factory and the Bethel home. All is voluntary service. This clearly appears to be the will of the Lord; and since it is his way, his people delight to follow in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has always followed the rule of contracting no debts, and therefore purchasing nothing necessary to carry on its work until it is apparent there is some way of paying the bill. For this reason it pays its bills promptly, proceeding upon the Scriptural admonition to “owe no man any thing”. The deficit that appears this year it is hoped will be made up at an early date.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society maintains its own building and factory at 117 Adams street, Brooklyn, not for the purpose of making money, but for the purpose of producing at the-least possible cost the literature that is so necessary to go into the hands of the people to inform them concerning God’s kingdom. Were this not true the cost of the books and booklets ■would be so great that many of the poor could not have them and the Society would not be able to give the literature to them. The management diligently considers how the literature can be put into the hands of the people at the least possible cost. Books of the size of those manufactured by the Society, if manufactured and sold in a commercial transaction, would be retailed at approximately $2.50 per book. The contribution accepted for one of these books never exceeds thirty cents, and often is much less than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the factory at Brooklyn has produced books, booklets, magazines, tracts, phonographs, transcription machines, and sound equipment, all for the purpose of carrying the message of the Kingdom to the people. There has been an average of 138 persons engaged in the work at this factory during the year. The phonographs, transcription machines, and sound equipment are produced and placed in the hands of the brethren at never above what it costs, and often at less than cost, and these sound equipments are used for the purpose of promulgating the message of the Kingdom. The factory is scheduled to work eight and one-half hours per day, five and one-half days per week. Saturday afternoon and Sunday are devoted to work of visiting the people and instructing them concerning the Lord’s message. During the year the demand for literature has so increased that it was found necessary to work additional hours, and often a shift is run at night; so the working days during the year aggregate a total of 300 days of operating time of the factory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work accomplished during the twelve months far surpasses that of any previous year. The total production of books and booklets reached the high mark of 28,117,523. This makes the average production of books and booklets 2,343,000 per month. In addition, there were millions of copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> printed, both of these magazines showing an increase over the previous year. Due to the tremendous demand in the field for literature, the booklets manufactured made a gain over the previous year of 2,800,366. The production of bound books decreased for two reasons: (1) the publishers were using their surplus supply, which was in storage throughout the country, and (2) we did not have the time to print more bound books, because of the additional work on sound equipment. Shipments of bound books .from the factory exceeded the production, thus depleting our surplus in store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to books, booklets and magazines, this factory also produced calendars, placards, radio folders, etc., to the number of 44,784,289 pieces. We manufactured also transcription machines, phonographs and special sound equipment. Below is set out for comparison the production for 1934 and that for 1935:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>PREACHING BY MACHINERY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Without a doubt the Lord has put it in the minds of men to produce machinery in these days and to use at least some of this to his own glory. In times past preaching was done by word of mouth, and that to comparatively small audiences. In these modern times mechanical devices are used, which are designated under the term “sound equipment”, and this includes phonographs, transcription machines, automobiles and trucks equipped with the necessary mechanical device to reproduce the speech on phonograph records or transcription records. These are used throughout the earth in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. This is not the message of any man, but the truth taken from God’s Word and put in such a way that the people may hear it without cost to themselves. There is a constant increase in the demand for this sound equipment, and the speeches are reproduced in the English and in several other languages. These speeches are reproduced by discs or records employed by the above-mentioned mechanical devices. Some of these cars are equipped with living quarters, so that the publishers may travel through the country and engage daily in preaching' the gospel message by means of sound equipment and then by producing the message in printed form that the people who are interested may study the same. Many of the publishers throughout the country equip their own private automobiles for reproducing the speech in this manner, so that they can preach the gospel as they drive through the country.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>PUBLICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are on the side of Jehovah God and his King more keenly appreciate today than at any time past that Jehovah has taken out from the world a people to publish his name and his kingdom. These publishers are designated in the Scriptures under the title of ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’, the anointed temple class; and the ‘Jonadabs’, who are those that associate themselves with the temple class; all of whom are termed &quot;publishers”. This is being done in obedience to the co</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font3">andment, of the Lord that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached to all the world as a witness and that all who hear the message are privileged to invite others to hear and come and partake of God’s gracious provision for the blessing of humankind and, above all, for the vindication of his own name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From an examination of the figures compiled from the reports it will be seen that the work of the Lord on the earth does not depend upon numbers. Often a smaller company, exhibiting greater zeal for the Lord, will accomplish more than larger numbers who manifest less zeal. During the fiscal year there were 5,000 less hours put in by the publishers in the field than in the previous year. The sound equipment, of course, assisted much in the publication. The brethren have gone from house to house amongst the people in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, exhibiting the books and booklets to the people and telling them of the Kingdom. In doing this they have talked less than in previous years. They carry with them a small card upon which is printed the introduction testimony, and this, when read by the person, quickly furnishes an opportunity to determine whether or not he wishes to avail himself of some reading matter that will help him to understand God’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">America, as above used, means the United States and islands that are near by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn office. During the fiscal year the field workers within this jurisdiction, and which field workers are designated as “publishers” of the Kingdom message, have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the total number of 14,663,284 volumes. This is an increase of 3,300,000 over the previous year. Thus at a glance it will be seen that the year 1935 has resulted in the greatest publication of the Kingdom message during any like period of time since the second coming of the Lord. This is exactly as we should expect it to be. God’s purpose is that the people shall have an opportunity to know the truth and he has laid this obligation upon the publishers, and they delight to obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What is here meant by outlying countries and islands that operate under the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn office direct is those countries where the publishers are so few in number that it is.not deemed best to maintain a branch office. It is often found very difficult to get the literature into some of these islands, because of technicalities and other obstacles put in the way by those who are opposed to the truth. This is particularly the case where these officers are dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">. One of the divinely provided means of promulgating ot publishing the Kingdom message is that by means of radio. The enemy, led in America by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has been diligent during the year past to prevent the preaching of the gospel by radio. Their papers have frequently published the statement that Jehovah’s witnesses are fast passing out of the picture. Surely the Lord must laugh at them as he sees these hypocritical agents of the adversary assuming to represent God, while representing the Devil and thus deceiving the people. Under these circumstances it is interesting to note that during the fiscal year upward of 295 radio stations were used approximately once a week in broadcasting the Kingdom message. The chief part of this broadcasting was by electrical transcription, to be sure, but the message went out just the same. In addition to this the radio’ has been used in a number of foreign countries, as will be shown in this report, and which have broadcast the Kingdom message by electrical transcription and otherwise. The total number of radio stations thus used during the year was 344.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year radio programs broadcasting in English by transcription records totaled 18,287. In addition thereto the message was broadcast in 21 different foreign languages to the number of 1,064 programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A series of special programs was broadcast during the year as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During the year the president of the Society delivered, in person, lectures by radio, and which were sent out over a chain of radio stations, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From New York (WBBE), November 18, 1934, &quot;Shall the Truth Be Suppressed?&quot; 6 stations</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">From New York (WBBE), June 23, 1935, &quot;Hiding the Truth”_______3 stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is worthy of note here that the broadcast from Washington, D. C., on June 2, by the Lord’s grace, surpassed any yet ever made in the transmission of human speech to different parts of the earth. The speech was delivered to an audience of upward of 20,000 persons at Washington Auditorium, whereas simultaneously throughout the city of Washington and at different points sound ears rebroadeast the message to others gathered in different parts of the city. It may therefore be reasonably said that the visible audience within the city of Washington amounted to 120,000 persons. By means of telegraph wires, wireless communication facilities, public-address system, and suchlike appliances, the speech was simultaneously transmitted to Europe, Asia, Africa, and the isles of the sea. While the speech was being delivered in Washington it was simultaneously recorded at Hollywood, California, and has since been rebroadcast by radio and transcription machines in various parts of the earth. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine gives a detailed report of this radio program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again on Sunday, June 9, this same lecture was broadcast at six o’clock in the morning especially for the benefit of Australia, and was there picked up and rebroadcast over a number of radio stations as will appear from the Australian report. At Bogota, Colombia, South America, station HKF picked up and rebroadcast this message as a public service. Reports of the various countries are to the effect that both of these broadcasts were clearly and well received.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>RADIO HEARING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At the beginning of the fiscal year the Federal Communications Commission at Washington afforded an opportunity for those interested in radio to appear before the Commission and submit their views relative to the use of radio. On October </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font3"> 1934, the beginning of the fiscal year of 1935, the president of the Society appeared before the Federal Communications Commission at Washington and presented some strong and convincing facts setting forth the activities of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in wrongfully interfering with the broadcasting by Jehovah’s witnesses. On that occasion the Hierarchy, although scheduled to make reply, made no answer whatsoever to the facts submitted except to deny that one of its agents had mutilated the public record. Its general and wicked opposition to the broadcasting the Kingdom message was not denied, and no attempt was made to explain the reason for its activities. The protest by the Society’s president on that occasion, together with argument, was filed with the Co</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font3">ission and is a matter of public record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In December of the same year Jehovah’s witnesses circulated amongst the people a petition addressed to the Congress of the United States. This petition contained a request for the publication of the testimony-taken by the Federal Communications Commission at the hearing above mentioned in order that the people might generally understand the situation. This petition, with 2,284,128 signatures of American citizens, was presented to the Congress in January, 1935, but was ignored, and nothing done concerning the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Later the Federal Communications Commission invited the various broadcasters to appear before it and submit testimony or briefs. On June 3 the Society, by its president, filed a brief before the Commission, the full text of which appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age of </span><span class="font3">June 19, 1935.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">By the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">publishers,</span><span class="font3"> as used herein, are meant those who go from place to place, house to house, or otherwise engaged in making known to the people this gospel of the Kingdom as commanded by the Lord. During the year just closed the publishers in the United States have largely increased. This is due chiefly to the fact that many persons of good will, otherwise called &quot;Jonadabs”, have joyfully united themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses in carrying the message of truth to the people. The publishers, therefore, may be divided into the following groups: pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the publishers are those of the Bethel family. Arrangement is made for the closing of the factory and home on certain dates so that all members of the family may engage in the field service. Each Saturday afternoon and Sunday the members of the family engage in this service. The reports for the year show that 189 members of the Bethel family is the largest number that engaged at any one time in this witness work, but during the year all the members had some part in this branch of the service. The family alone placed books and booklets to the number of 93,284 in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>DIVISIONAL CAMPAIGNS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The divisional campaigns were not so many during the year, due to the fact that the service periods had increased in number and each community has a campaign oftener than in previous years. These divisional campaigns are a great stimulus to the brethren. They travel from their homes to a stated point within the divisional territory and there organize into companies and engage actively in the service, resulting in carrying the witness to thousands of persons and distributing a great quantity of literature. The Lord has greatly blessed this effort during the year. The following table setting forth the divisional campaigns during the year will be of interest:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>SPECIAL SERVICE PERIODS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the year there were sis special service periods, including two international service periods above mentioned. These service periods show an increased number of publishers and a decidedly increased number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people over the previous year. The sound equipment employed on these occasions greatly aided the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>REGIONAL DIRECTORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the Society had in the field eleven English-speaking regional service directors, besides some that employed other languages. These service directors served 1,845 company organizations, co-operating with the publishers in the various vicinities. This required them to travel a total of 162,564 miles, at an expense to the Society of $4,597.76.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To facilitate service activities in ■ the larger and more thickly populated centers the Society has placed for an indefinite period service directors in the following towns, to wit: Greater New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Portland, and Denver. Here all the field publishers are under the immediate direction of the director of service, who is under the immediate direction of the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are times that men sent out by the Society assume more authority than they should and cause much uneasiness and disturbance amongst some companies. The fixed policy of the Society is this: That all direction in regard to service comes from the Brooklyn office, and this is sent to the various companies in writing, either by special letter or by publication in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Director</span><span class="font3"> or in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Any orders or instructions that come from any person contrary to what appears in these publications should not be followed by the local companies, but the Society at 117 Adams street should be immediately notified. We are aware of the fact that the adversary is everywhere attempting to disturb the Lord’s work. This is the time of unity of those who are really of the temple class, and every one should strive to maintain that unity. Those who are really devoted to the Lord and anointed will dwell together in unity and work together in full unity and co-operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At stated times brethren from the Bethel family are sent out to serve companies within the vicinity of Greater New York and within a radius of 200 miles from the headquarters. Below are set forth the names of the various men who are ordained and authorized as representatives of the Society, and who engaged in preaching the gospel as divinely ordained, as set forth in the Scriptures:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One means of publishing the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">gdom message is that of conventions or assemblies of the Lord’s people at stated times. These assemblies or conventions are held in various parts of the country. Of the three outstanding conventions of the fiscal year was one held at Atlanta, Georgia, in November, at which time there was broadcast the lecture &quot;Who Shall Rule the World?” That convention was attended by a large number of the brethren from different parts of the country, practically all of whom engaged in the service. They placed in the hands of the people in Atlanta and vicinity more than 23,000 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next convention of outstanding importance was that held at Los Angeles, California, in January. At that time the lecture &quot;Universal War Near” was broadcast over a nation-wide chain of radio stations and created a tremendous interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chief convention of the year was that at Washington, D.C., May 31 to June 5, and upward of 20,000 of the Lord’s people attended this convention. There the radio and sound equipment were extensively used. It was at this convention that the Lord made known to his people the correct understanding of the &quot;great multitude” as described in the seventh chapter of The Revelation. This revelation stirred the brethren and stimulated them to renewed activities, and everywhere throughout the earth come the reports exhibiting joy in the fact that the remnant now have the privilege of carrying the message to the great multitude, and these together working to the honor of the Lord’s name. Space will not permit us here to set forth a detailed report of the Washington convention, but all who attended, and all who listened to the programs by radio, will find much joy in the contemplation of what took place on that occasion. The lecture “Government” broadcast on that occasion, together with the subsequent lecture “Hiding the Truth”, was put in booklet form, and up to this time more than five million copies have been issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCHTOWER</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, issued twice each month, is the channel used by the Lord for transmitting the unfolding of his prophecies to those who are devoted to him and his kingdom. No human creature is entitled to any credit for what appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> AU honor and credit is due to the Lord. Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are our teachers, and every one who reads </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> rejoices in the fact that the Lord is pleased to use that magazine to aid his people in understanding the truth. During the year </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions have had a healthy increase, thus indicating the increased interest of those who have turned to the Lord. Every Jonadab should subscribe for and carefully study </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font3">Many of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> are furnished to the poor free of charge; and since it takes no advertising whatever, the cost must be sustained entirely by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine, another of the Society’s publications, is used to transmit matters of general interest to those who are watching the development of the Lord’s kingdom. The circulation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> has had a healthy increase during the year, and many persons have come to realize that it is about the only magazine on earth publishing general news that in<sup>-</sup> fact publishes the truth. The honest endeavor of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> is to set forth things as they are, that the people may see the clear distinction between Jehovah’s organization and that which opposes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>ENEMY ACTIVITIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are the only ones on earth making known to the people that all the trouble and distress to which the human race has fallen heir is properly chargeable to the Devil and his agents. This is the time mentioned in Revelation 12:12, when Satan is desperately attempting to plunge the whole human race into destruction. The Devil hates the truth, and he plants in the mind and heart of his various agents on earth a wicked desire to oppose God’s kingdom and incites them to oppose the Kingdom. Throughout the United States during the year the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their associates in hypocrisy, that is, the once so-called “Protestant” clergymen, have engaged in a subtle campaign in opposition to the kingdom of the Lord. These have induced the lawmaking bodies of many parts of the country to enact laws looking to the interruption of the Lord’s work. They have caused many of the Lord’s people to be charged with association and co-operation with the Communists, whereas they well know that those devoted to the Lord have no interest whatsoever and do not participate in any manner with political agitators. Upon this false pretext the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies have caused legislative bodies to enact laws looking to the prevention of the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom by word of mouth, in public halls, by means of radio, sound cars and other mechanical devices. They have caused police officials to arrest and throw into prison many inoffensive men and women, and that without any evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever. Many of these police officers are put in fear of losing their jobs, and it is with great reluctance that they interfere with Jehovah’s witnesses at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the Society has defended 478 persons who have been arrested and thrown into prison on the charge of going from house to house preaching the gospel without first obtaining a permit from the police. As hereinbefore set forth, it would be an insult to the Lord to ask permission of man to do what God has commanded must be done, and even though the Lord’s people are subjected to arrest and imprisonment, and much physical suffering, this is far to be preferred to disobedience to God’s commandment. The publishers at the present time remember the difficulties encountered by the Lord Jesus and the apostles of the early days; and since the Lord told them that all faithful men would suffer in this manner, they receive this persecution at the hands of the enemy as an evidence that they are privileged to participate in the sufferings of Christ to the end that they might maintain their integrity and show their devotion to Jehovah. For this reason they rejoice in the sufferings of Christ that are left behind for the body’s sake. For their comfort and aid the Lord reveals to them the fact that long ago he foreknew and foretold these very conditions and that by this knowledge, together with the other blessings from the Lord, these faithful brethren are able to withstand a continuous assault upon them. They know of the danger in their pathway, and their life on earth is not dear when compared with life eternal forever with the Lord. Therefore they delight to go on with the work amidst great</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">opposition; and when they see at the end of the year that the Lord has greatly blessed their efforts, this is an occasion for additional joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>RETROSPECTIVE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is interesting to look back through the records since the beginning of the Elisha work, as compared with what was done in the Elijah period, and see how greatly the Lord has blessed those who have faithfully to the best of their ability carried out their covenant. These records show that the distribution of books and booklets began actively in 1893 and from that time until and including 1918 there was placed in the hands of the people in the United States a total of 9,737,224 books and booklets. From 1918 to 1919 there was practically nothing done, because of the restraint of the Lord’s people by reason of the activities of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From 1919 on the work began to get in shape to be carried forward, and from that date until 1935 inclusive the distribution of books and booklets in the United States alone has reached a total of approximately seventy-five million. There has been a gradual and healthy increase, particularly since 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These figures corroborate what has heretofore been published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> that since the release of the Lord’s people from prison following the World War and the reorganization of the work thereafter, and particularly since the anointing in 1922, there has been a forward movement in the publishing of the message of the Kingdom to the glory of Jehovah. A climax has been reached during the fiscal year of 1935 in the distribution of more than fourteen and one-half million books and booklets within the United States and the territory under the direct jurisdiction of this office. When -we observe this -tremendous increase and have in mind the smaller number of those who claim to be in the truth in the latter period, we ean but call to mind the words of the psalmist: “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. ’ ’—Ps. 118; 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On every hand the activities of the enemy increase. We see the enemy gradually surrounding God’s people throughout the earth. We know that salvation proceeds alone from Jehovah God, that the prosperity of his kingdom is absolute and certain, that soon the triumph of the Lord will be made manifest; and therefore those on Jehovah’s side with joy continue to pray: “Save now, we beseech thee, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">Jehovah: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah.”—Ps, 118:25,26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>AFRICA (South, Central and East)</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3">The territory here mentioned is far flung and requires a tremendous effort to be put forth by the brethren in order to carry this message to all people who desire to hear. Jehovah’s witnesses meet this condition with joyful hearts, and no burden, by the Lord’s grace, is too great for them to undertake. The Lord has greatly blessed their efforts during the year. There has been a substantial increase of the publishing of the message of the Kingdom throughout this territory. After twelve months of the fiscal year end, it is found that the total distribution of the books and booklets is, to wit, 375,281, which is an increase of more than 115,000 over the previous year. Quite </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">cosmopolitan population inhabits this territory. The Kingdom message has been distributed in 23 different languages, to wit: English, Afrikaans, German, Sol-landish, French, Greek, Swedish, Portuguese, Italian, Chinyanja, Xosa, Sesuto, Zulu, Chiwemba, Arabic, Gujerati, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Yiddish, Chinese and Japanese. The opposition grows in Africa. Like everywhere else, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, directed from its seat of operation at Vatican City, Rome, sees to it that every possible effort is put forth to hinder the proclamation of the truth. The increase of the work is sufficient answer to that opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following is quoted from the report of the local director of service in that vicinity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our experiences in Jehovah’s chariot have been thrilling. The Greater Jehu is driving furiously, and as the pace becomes faster our joy and enthusiasm increase. In South Africa the bulk of the work has again been done in the Union, which comprises the four provinces of The Cape, Transvaal, Natal and Orange Free State. In addition, however, the good news of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom was carried by pioneers into the various British native protectorates of Basutoland, Swaziland, and Beehuana-land, and the mandated territory of South-West Africa. SouthWest Africa, which prior to the great war was a German colony, is a territory vast in size but comparatively thinly populated. The European population consists of Germans and South Africans of British and Dutch descent. Two pioneers covered the whole of that territory in live months, placing 13,000 books and booklets, and took 70 subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. A.</span><span class="font2"> brief summary of the house-to-house witness work in the Union, The Protectorates and South-West Africa follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Approximately fifty percent of the Eterature has been distributed by the pioneers, who have averaged 111 hours each per month throughout the year. These brethren have worked hard, for in addition to the time actually spent in the above manner considerable time has been given to the work with the Bound machines. Much time too has been spent in traveling. Several, pioneers have weak physical frames, but the joy of the Lord is their strength. Of hardships and opposition there </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ha</span><span class="font2">s been plenty, but as good soldiers they have learned to endure hardness and they consider it an honor second to none to be privileged to be right in the thick of the fray. The auxiliaries have also done well, and with a monthly average of 59 hours are on the right side of their quota. A considerable number of the company publishers regularly exceed the suggested quota of 15 hours per month, but those living on farms with little or no territory for miles around can, in some cases, participate only in the special campaigns, and in consequence the average all over is brought down to 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaign Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About two-fifths of the total literature placed in the witness work in the Union went out during the five special campaigns. These special occasions of giving praise to Jehovah are greatly appreciated by the publishers in this country, and all of Jehovah’s witnesses have some share therein. Enthusiasm reached a great height during the April campaign, when the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Eule the World? His Vengeance,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy </span><span class="font2">were widely distributed. A considerable number of Jonadabs co-operated, and those brethren who by reason of age or infirmity were unable to participate in the field work had a part also by posting booklets to friends and relatives, and to those living in isolation. It was easily the most widespread witness to date. The figures for the five campaigns which come into our service year are given below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work with the sound machines shows a healthy increase. Twelve months ago we had 18 transcription machines in action. Now we have 21 machines and 48 phonographs. After being let down by an Afrikaans professor in New York who undertook to do the recording of Afrikaans transcription records a brother at Brooklyn headquarters applied himself to the job with such good success that Brother Rutherford’s lectures will be clearly followed in that language and a much wider witness given to the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom message. Phonograph records in English to the number of 905 have been placed with those who have the Society’s phonographs and to others who have machines of their own. While in recent months the number of machines reported in action is close to 60, the monthly average over the whole year was 35. There have been 3,138 meetings, with a total attendance of 85,883, or an average of 27 per meeting. To advertise these meetings upward of 300,000 leaflets, each containing a pointed testimony, and other advertising matter were used. With the opening up of the Scriptures relating to the “great multitude’’ we appreciate the fact that there is much work yet to be done for and by this company, and the witness with the sound machines in conjunction with the house-to-house work is just the ideal method of establishing contact with the Jonadabs. Publishers who have worked within hearing of the machines have been much encouraged themselves, and they all report that more interest in the message is aroused when a machine is operating than when there is none. The work with the sound machines is not confined to the Union, for phonographs and records have found their way to the Rhodesias, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa, St. Helena, Mauritius and East Africa. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font2">d now for the Sound Car Equipment!

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s blessing has rested upon the arrangement </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font2">opening a depot in this part of Central Africa. The work in that land has gone ahead during the past twelve months. That, of course, has not pleased everyone, and there has been gome opposition. Some of the missionaries have endeavored to incite government officials to interfere with the activities of the brethren and to prevent them from spreading the message of God ’a kingdom. In this they have failed, although the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Cnsis</span><span class="font2"> in English and Chmyanja was banned by the governor in council in November, 1934, and now, in addition to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> can no longer be imported into that country. The few Europeans in Nyasaland display little appreciation of the Kingdom message, but many of the natives manifest </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">keen and intelligent interest therein. It seems clear that thousands of natives in Central Africa will form part of the great multitude who will take their stand on Jehovah’s Bide. Those who have the intelligence to grasp the message not only do so with alacrity but just as promptly see and appreciate the responsibility of passing it on to others. During the year there has been a monthly average of 340 publishers. These have Spent 76,547 hours in the Kingdom service. There were 14,357 obtamers, in whose hands 16,078 pieces of literature were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rhodesias</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">European witnesses resident in the Tthodesias are few in number, and, while frequently treated with contempt by snobs and others who do not know any better, have been permitted to engage in the witness work unhindered, and they have done bo with regularity throughout the year. In certain parts of both countries our native brethren have had a square deal from government officials who have upheld the law of the land and given the brethren freedom to worship God in a manner agreeable to their own conscience. The Koman Catholic Hierarchy, however, is strongly represented in these lands and much willful and wicked persecution has been meted out to humble men and women whose only ‘ ‘ crime ’ ’ has been distributing the good news of and concerning the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">gdom of God. Much of the trouble has arisen in the villages, which appear to have been, until the arrival of Jehovah’s witnesses, the special preserve of the Hierarchy or one or other of the denominational missions. Ab soon as a humble bearer of the glad tidings of Jehovah’s kingdom arrives on the scene events that took place in the early days of the church’b history (Acts 5: 14; 6: 7) are re-enacted. The hireling shepherd, faced with the prospect of losing his flock overnight, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font2">ediately goes to the native thief with the false accusation that Jehovah’s witnesses are disturbers of the peace and are undermining his (the chief’s) authority and that unless he takes immediate action he will lose his job. The native chief is thus incited to lay a charge against the brethren. The district r.n</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmi.q</span><span class="font2">sinnAT who hears the case frequently forgets all about the law guaranteeing religious liberty and makes an effort to get the J.w. to change his religion by reminding </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font2"> that there are the Boman Catholic, Dutch Beformed, African Methodist Episcopal, and other churches, any one of which he ought to join, and in some instances the witness is offered his liberty there and then if he will follow this suggestion. Needless to say there is nothing doing in that line I If the district co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmi</span><span class="font2">ssinnar decides to inflict punishment for some alleged infringement of the law, such as preac</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">g the gospel without a permit, a fine with the alternative of imprisonment is imposed. The fine is never paid, and the witnesses on the conclusion of their sentence leave jail ‘rejoicing that they have been counted worthy to Buffer shame for His name’. Sometimes the district commissioner follows Pilate’s example. He knows that Jehovah’s witnesses have committed no crime and he can find no fault in them except concerning the law of their God. Put to satisfy the clamor of the missionaries and the native chief the prisoner is handed over to the native chief, who is given a free hand to impose whatever punishment he sees fit, and the witness is thus ‘thrown to the lions’. Witnesses have been beaten and imprisoned, and on one occasion recently it was reported that a brother while still serving a jail sentence had his home broken down. The most violent opposers have been the Awemba Christian (!) people of the Catholic church and the Christian (?) people of the African Methodist Episcopal church. Following a vigorous protest that such things could happen in a British colony the law of which guarantees religious liberty the government of Northern Bhodesia at length intimated that they would no longer raise any obstacle to our establishing European control within the borders of that country. ‘(This has been denied to us for some years.) Following our protest and prior to receipt of the government’s invitation a strike of native mine workers broke out on the Copper Belt. The government increased the native poll tax and tried to enforce it without adequate notice to the natives. An attempt was made to break the strike, and in the resulting riot firearms were used by the police and 14 natives were killed. Members of the Hierarchy and other enemies of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">gdom immediately saw to it that the charge was made that “agitators connected with the Watchtower movement were behind the strikers’’. Of course, not one of Jehovah’s witnesses had any share either in instigating the strike or in the actual disturbances which followed. Our native brethren in many parts of both the Bhodesias were arrested and closely questioned, but in every instance were released without any charge having been brought against them. A Commission of Inquiry has been Bet up and, not having a jot of evidence against any of our brethren, government officials, still anxious to shift the responsibility, from themselves and to make us the &quot;scapegoat”, have been dwelling at considerable length on the &quot;subversive tendency of our literature”. The commissioner of police has gone so far as to describe certain passages as ‘positively indecent’. The plea is that our literature brings Europeans and those in authority into contempt. No evidence has been forthcoming, however, that any of those responsible for the strike were influenced in any way by the reading of our literature. On the other hand, the very opposite is true: those under the influence of our literature remained quietly in their huts and did not even form part of the alleged riotous mob into which the police found it necessary to shoot. The chief ringleaders were the Awembas, a tribe whose spiritual interests are catered for almost entirely by the Catholic ‘white fathers'. A European representative of the Society and several of the native service directors have given evidence before the Co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmi</span><span class="font2">ssion, and their evidence establishes the fact that we had no responsibility in the matter whatsoever. Independent witnesses, such as the general manager of the Roan Antelope Copper Mine, at which mine in Luanshya the rioting took place, have gone on record before the Co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmis</span><span class="font2">sion that the strike was due to a combination of two things, namely, the increase of the poll tax and its enforcement without notice. And this is the general consensus of opinion amongst Europeans outside of governmental and missionary circles living in that country. At the time of writing this report the Co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmis</span><span class="font2">sion has not concluded its hearings, but we are hoping that their findings wiR be just and that the door will be kept wide open for the further proclamation of the good news of God’s kingdom. It is an interesting fact that although natives belonging to the various denominational churches were mixed up in the strike, not a single charge has been made by government officials against one of these organizations. The press run by &quot;big business” has also had a share in this conspiracy to work injury to Jehovah’s witnesses and to bring reproach upon the name of Jehovah; for while they gave much publicity to the evidence of government officials, they almost entirely suppressed our evidence. This conspiracy, part of the general conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses, will soon be fully exposed. In face of all the persecution Jehovah’s native witnesses have given an excellent account of themselves, and we are confident that there will be some amongst those humble and much despised (by some) people who will maintain their integrity to the end and thns have a share in proving Satan a liar and in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. During the past twelve months there has been a monthly average of 350 publishers. These have spent 52,131 hours publishing the good news of the Kingdom. There have been 16,383 obtainers of literature, who have received in all 18,402 books and booklets. These figures are considerably in excess of those for the previous twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two pioneers from the Union visited Portuguese East Africa during the year and a good witness has been given at Lourenco Marques and other places by these brethren and also by European and native witnesses resident in that country. Close on 3,000 pieces of literature have been distributed. Recently four pioneer brethren trekked by car from the Union to Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda. The long journey was accomplished without mishap. They report that the literature is going out freely and in the first month’s work they have taken close on 40 subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In St. Helena, as the result of work accomplished by means of one of the Society’s phonographs, a little company of six has been organized. A second phonograph has been brought into action, and the witnesses there are pressing the battle to the gate. Whenever there is a show, exhibition or public function of any </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">d, one of the phonographs is taken along, lectures are put over and literature placed with the interested. The phonographs are placed near by an open window at some home in the ev</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ening</span><span class="font2">, and neighbors and passers-by frequently stop to listen. Recorded 41-minute lectures dealing with various aspects of the Kingdom message may now be heard in the island of Mauritius. The brethren living there have been greatly encouraged by the talks and continue to do what they can to interest others in them and in the literature which covers the subjects in greater detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Watchtower” and “The Golden Age”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of persons subscribing for these journals shows a further increase. The number of subscribers for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> now stands at 411, to compare with 390 a year ago, and for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> 653, to compare with 420 twelve months ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren in the office and store continue to appreciate the privilege of service. The volume of work has increased considerably. Letters coming in numbered 7,135, and going out, 7,773. Ln addition, 7,000 circular letters and 5,000 bulletins were sent out. An ever-increasing number of people of good will in all coiners of the country write to the office for information about the literature and the work. Their expression of gratitude for the light received from the Lord through the literature does one’s heart good, and it is a real joy to serve such. Rail packages dispatched numbered 2,126, and postal packets, 4,776. The printing mac</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">e has again rendered useful service in the preparation of advertising matter and office stationery. Many happy days at the week-ends and on public holidays are spent in the field service. We averaged six hours each per week throughout the year, placed 1,055 bound volumes and 5,561 booklets. The total distribution of 6,616 exceeds the previous year’s figure by 1,868 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past year has been full of happy experiences, and the Lord has crowned the year for us with the report of the doings of Jehovah’s Government at Washington. Your bold and stirring lecture on “Government” was greatly appreciated, and we look forward to distributing it far and wide during the next campaign. The prophecy of Habakkuk as opened up in recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font2"> has given us a clearer vision of “Jehovah’s Battle” than anyt</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">g we have yet read, and now the articles on “The Great Multitude” are clarifying a subject that has been shrouded in mystery for many years. We render praise to Jehovah for the flood-lighting of his Word, which we know is due to the fact that the Lord is now at the temple. The realization of the fact that we have now been gathered together at Armageddon and that absolute devotion to the Lord is required of all, whether anointed or Jonadab, will be an incentive to each one to seize eagerly every opportunity for service that comes along. Ab in every other part of the earth, so it is here: those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah appreciate the fact that love for the Lord finds expression in bearing the fruits of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom to the people, and love for one’s brethren finds expression, not in the old-time fellowship of gossip, grumbles and criticism over the teacups, but in partnership in the work and thus strengthening one another's hands in the Lord. It is a pleasure to report that the Greater Gideon’s little band down here are st</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">andin</span><span class="font2">g “every man in his place round about the camp” and we will, by the Lord’s grace, continue to shout our battle-cry until the enemy host has been put to flight and Jehovah’s great and illustrious </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">name</span><span class="font2"> is completely vindicated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Working under a great disadvantage, a few brethren in West Africa, and who work out of Lagos, Nigeria, British West Africa, have carried the message to that and surrounding territory. The placing of literature in the hands of the people has exceeded that of previous years. There have been some lawless ones who profess to be the Lord’s children, but these have not succeeded in impeding the work. The truly devoted ones have pushed on in the publishing of the Kingdom message. The distribution of books and booklets in that country during the year totals &quot;98,434: volumes. Says the report of the local director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The common people hail for the kingdom of Jehovah which will rule the world in righteousness; the higher-ups pay little </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font2">no heed to the message of truth. Many of them are satisfied with devil worship, as is performed in the Roman Catholic and so-called &quot;Protestant” churches. If it were not for the depression, and oppressive measures of the government in the collection of the head tax in the country places, the people would have secured much more of our literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions, Transcriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We had two conventions during our fiscal year, one in the capital, and the other in Warri, a distance of over 920 </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font2">es from the capital. Both conventions were very stimulating to the publishers; they are realizing more and more the necessity of obeying organization instructions, that they may be amongst those that will be hid during the battle of Armageddon. (Zeph. 2: 1-3) Quite a number of books and booklets were placed in the homes of the people during the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The transcription machines offer good opportunities among those that can understand the English language. The difficulty at present is in the outdoor witnessing. The majority that attend cannot follow, nor understand the lectures, because of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">big humming noise that follows, and the voice of the lecturer is drowned. If the records were in the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">diff</span><span class="font2">erent dialects, perhaps the result would be better in the outdoor transcription lectures. Some of the pioneers are touring the country places with the phonograph lectures, and the results are gratifying. Many orders are co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font2">g in for phonographs and records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font2"> are eagerly looked for by the Jonadabs, and keenly read too, but from the issue of August 1, on the “great multitude”, there is a rush for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font2"> as soon as the boat arrives. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions are also on the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The translation of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font2"> in the Itsekiri language was much appreciated by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Summary Report for Year Ending September 30, 1935</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>ALSACE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While this country is a part of France, because of the peculiar conditions it is found advantageous to have a director of service within that territory. Alsace has nearly two million inhabitants. The people are Catholic generally, but some of these ardent and faithful ones have broken away from the enemy’s institutions and have taken their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. Within the territory there are 14 companies organized for service and who are actively engaged in the service. And there is an average of 204 publishers regularly in the field giving witness to the truth. During the year they have engaged in the service 23,467 hours and have placed 4,022 books, 84,065 booklets, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazines to the number of 30,843. The largest company is at Strasbourg, and the publishers there are active and zealous in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The local director of service, in his report, amongst other things says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past service year received a special stimulus through the convention, in Basle and the presence of Brother Rutherford. All the brethren returned with renewed determination and hearts full of joy, which naturally influenced the result of the work. Thus Th</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ank</span><span class="font2">sgiving Week resulted in the greatest success ever attained, in that 5,970 publications were put into the hands of the people. The clergy, of course, by their insidious actions tried to keep the people from receiving the truth. This was particularly noticeable in the Breusch valley, although it had previously always been our best territory. This time we could leave hardly any literature. Nevertheless the result of our work is very gratif</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ying</span><span class="font2">: the brethren of the Strasbourg company put in 500 more wor</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">king</span><span class="font2"> hfiurs than last year. The blessing of the Lord rested upon these efforts so that the result was also a better one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As regards the activity with the electrical transcription machine, there were 33 lectures given, with an attendance of 962. To advertise these lectures 30,500 leaflets were distributed, in addition to a number of advertisements m the newspapers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s office is located at Buenos Aires, the Argentine Republic, and from there the message is carried, not only into Argentina, but into Uruguay, Chile, and Paraguay. The publishers have been few, but they have the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and have joyfully carried the message from place to place and have put in the hands of the people a total of 138,523 books and booklets of the Society’s publications, besides a large number of Bibles. In addition thereto </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> has had a good circulation, many copies being given away freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The transcription records are broadcast by radio in each of the four countries above mentioned from time to time. During the year 266 radio programs of this nature have been put on. In addition thereto the phonograph meetings have been well attended, and it is hoped that much good has resulted therefrom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The territory covered from the Australian branch office, at Strathfield, includes Australia, New Zealand, and the near-by islands of the sea. While the Roman Catholic Hierarchy puts forth its strongest efforts there to hinder the work, God’s people continue to push forward. The unity of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions is manifest everywhere. Every now and again an “elective elder’’ bobs up and interferes with the Jonadabs. This is really a deplorable condition so far as he is concerned. He not only fails to show an appreciation of the truth concerning the Kingdom, but is doing positive injury to those of the great multitude who must know the truth. The evidence is always conclusive that the one who shows a bossy spirit, such as “elective elders”, is not of the temple and should not, under any circumstances, be permitted to be the leader of a class study. Where no suitable person of the anointed is had, then let the Jonadabs organize their own meetings and let their studies be conducted under the direction of the office at headquarters. Jonadabs can be assigned their separate territory and work independently. It would be better, of course, if some of Jehovah’s witnesses would take the lead; but if anyone wants to act as a dog in the manger, then those who have the spirit of the Lord will ignore him and go on with the work. The faithful ones throughout the territory here mentioned are rejoicing greatly in their privilege of doing what the Lord has graciously permitted them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report coming from the director of service at the Australian headquarters sets out in detail the work, and from it we quote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution of Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the commencement of the year the branch made a quota of 1,100,000 pieces of literature, or 100,000 more than the pre-viouB year. During the year we received word through the American </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> that henceforth the aim should be to express quotas in terms of hours in the field rather than in an amount of literature to be placed. We are glad to say that not only has our quota of 400,000 hours been exceeded by 3,776, but also our original quota for literature has been exceeded by 188,254 pieces, the total placed for the year being 1,288,254 pieces. There has been a marked decrease in the output of bound books, due to the fact that the people are still suffering from the depression and many are receiving the bare necessities from employment under the government relief schemes. In spite of the fact that Satan’s crazy organization is tottering, many continue to hope against hope that it will right itself, and thus reconcile themselves to the present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The splendid totals for The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period, in which 173,812 pieces of literature were placed, contributed largely to the results attained for the year. Australia and New Zealand together have an area about equal to that of the United States, and with about one-fifteenth of your population. It is therefore seen that a tremendous witness has been given by the Lord’s grace and to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As our service year commences August 1 and ends July 31, only five special testimony periods have been included in our report, whereas six will be reported from other parts of the field. The literature placed during these five testimony periods amounts to 413,312 pieces, representing more than one-third of the year’s total in 45 days’ work. Without doubt the special periods are a wonderful stimulus to the work, and the united action of the remnant strikes terror into the heart of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our printing press has been kept exceedingly busy printing radio leaflets, transcription leaflets, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font2"> circulars, stationery, service material, etc. The total output of the printing press, including the 'Hell Hot’ leaflets, is 1,354,792 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The regular visits of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> with its highly nutritive contents is a continual source of strength and encouragement to Jehovah’s people. True to his promise, the Lord has set a table before us in the presence of the enemy. A good increase is shown in the number of subscribers, amounting to 598, and the renewals are also keeping up to the mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> is becoming increasingly popular, and the demand for some of the numbers exceeds the supply. We are making a special effort with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> during the year 1935-36, when we hope to see our subscription list doubled. New subscriptions for the year amounted to 958, and only </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">few. of the existing subscribers failed to renew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the present time we have 2,019 subscribers for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> and 2,528 for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Work Done by the Various Divisions of the Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers: The year has seen a further decline in the average number Of pioneers reporting each month, the figures being 34 less than during the previous year. In spite of this, however, nearly half of the total literature placed (567,038 pieces) was due to the untiring efforts of the pioneers, and notwithstanding the reduction in their numbers, they have placed nearly 7,000 more pieces of literature than during the previous year. Although the average hours worked throughout the year is 100 monthly, many of the pioneers consistently work long hours under trying conditions, singing forth the praises of Jehovah as they go and reaching the people with the Kingdom message in the remote corners of this land as well as in the more thickly populated centers. Long distances, rough roads and indifferent transport facilities do not deter them. The Continent has been combed from end to end, and only on rare occasions do we now meet those who have never heard of the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are at present 172 pioneers on our list. Some with families who were previously in the service have been compelled to take relief work to support their dependents. Others have been transferred to other branches of the service, and still others have left the pioneer work because of the cares of this life. Faithfulness on the part of those who remain will more than compensate for any loss due to the thinning out of the ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Auxiliaries : The number of auxiliaries now enrolled is 115, and during the year their placements totaled 157,898 pieces of literature and each worked an average of 45 hours per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Company publishers and R</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nAn</span><span class="font2">v.qwormr.Rq; We are glad to advise an increase in the number of company publishers and sharpshooters reporting, and this is to be expected as the great multitude continue to come forth. The monthly average of publishers reporting in this division of the service is 891, and the mai</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">n rm rm</span><span class="font2"> number in the field was during April, when 1,476 lined up for service. The average hours worked throughout the year by the companies and sharpshooters were 12 monthly, and the total literature placed was 419,274 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the report shows that on the average each division of the service failed to reach the required hours monthly, many individuals put forth noble efforts, and with such sacrifices the Lord is well pleased. Much sickness and bad weather interfered with the work. No doubt the enemy is using this weapon here, while elsewhere he is working through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the strong-arm squad to suppress the work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the old days a few public lectures were held at great expense and with little result. More has been done during the year just closed than would be possible in five years before the transcription machines were introduced. Cur objective was 150,000 in attendance at the transcription meetings, but the completed figures show that a total of 251,817 attended the lectures during the year and 14,947 meetings were held, making an average attendance of nearly 17 to each meeting. The machines are used in a variety of ways, and there seems to be no end to the possibilities of this equipment. Parties witnessing from door to door work in conjunction with a mac</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">e, using a piece of music to draw attention and then a 4J-mmute lecture record. This method always increases the interest of the people, so that they are more easily approached. In several cities there are regular stands where lectures are given weekly. Hundreds of people attend these meetings. Workers in remote parts often come in contact with people who hear the lectures on the Sydney Domain. The total attendance at the Domain lectures for the year was 27,303, and 2,427 pieces of literature were placed at these meetings. At the same park many speakers expound their views, among them being representatives of the Catholics. One of their number complained to the police that our lectures are abusive and requested them to stop us. The police who are somewhat friendly to the truth refused their request and said that our lectures are not half as abusive as the Catholic speakers. Lectures are often held, at factories during the midday meal hour, and the attendance ranges from a handful to hundreds. At the government railway workshops in Queensland the employees’ committee invited us to use their rostrum to present a lunch-hour program. When the engineer in charge learned of it he would not .permit Jehovah’s witnesses to enter the premises. However, the program was given outside the gates before an audience of 400 men and the men were told what had occurred. At the conclusion the men passed a resolution of protest against the action of their chief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■On two occasions arrangements were made with the promoters of a surf carnival to announce through the microphone their various events in return for which we- were allowed to put on some of the lectures interspersed with musical items. Tins was a great witness, as large crowds weie in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The phonographs are being used extensively both in the house-to-house work and in special eve</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g work which has for its object the arrangement of transcription meetings in the homes of the people. In tins latter work parties work two by two and call upon the people usually between 6: 30 and 8: 30 p m., when the man of the house is usually at home. Those interested are directed to the transcription lectures and introduced to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For some months one company had the use of a cinema each Sunday. The hall was situated on a busy thoroughfare, and the people just walked in and there was no expense in advertising. The lectures were reproduced through the theater sound system with excellent results. The hall was also used for the company studies. We are sure that other companies would find that a wonderful witness would be given by regularly using a cinema situated in a busy locality. Such buildings are far superior to ordinary halls for transcription lectures. The theater above referred to has now been sold, but it is hoped that another will be available at an early date. Several special transcription lectures have been held and advertised mainly by microphone. The attendance at such meetings has been as high as 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Up to date there has not been much interference with the open air transcription work. Sometimes a householder complains and along comes a police officer. If he is handled tactfully and the work explained to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font2"> he usually goes away quite satisfied and sometimes he remarks, “Well, I don’t see why anyone should complain at your work.” That some pressure is being exercised, there is no doubt, as municipal authorities are now tal</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">king</span><span class="font2"> of fr</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">aming</span><span class="font2"> laws to abate what is railed “the sound nuisance”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The conditions in the islands are strenuous, due to the climate and tropical diseases. Europeans can exist there only by having frequent changes to a cooler climate. During the year it was necessary for some of the pioneers to come to Australia for a while, as constantly recurring sickness made it impossible for them to work. A boat has now been provided by the Lord’s grace, and it is hoped'that, by arranging for frequent changes so that some of the boat party can work on shore and those on shore can take their places on the boat, the health of the pioneers in these regions will be better and the work benefited generally. With the en</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi-n</span><span class="font2">g of the boat to the East Indies, seven additional pioneers have been brought into the field in this area. In addition to this, two brethren in Java have entered the pioneer service, and it is expected that with these additional workers a great witness will be given. The boat has been named the “Lightbearer'and its journey from Sydney, Australia, with a crew of seven young men has given the truth a great deal of press publicity. In all the ports where the vessel has called reporters came aboard and gave a good write-up concerning the Society’s work and published photographs of the boat. Transcription lectures were given at various ports from the vessel’s sound equipment with good effect. A trail of literature was left behind them, some places being reached with the Kingdom message for the first time. The navigation of the boat from Sydney to the East Indies, via New Guinea, was a formidable undertaking, and the Lord sent along the right men for the job in due time. Only the captain and one of the crew had experience with boats. The intention was to sail from Sydney 400 miles to Lord Howe island, &quot;but a fierce storm arose against which the 52-foot craft with its precious cargo battled for days. Owing to the contrary winds they could not make Lord Howe island, and two weeks after sailing from Sydney the boat put in at Brisbane. Another incident which shows Jehovah’s watchcare over his people was experienced in the Coral sea between New Guinea and Australia. The boat was becalmed with engine broken down and drifting onto a reef when suddenly a breeze came up and they were able to Bad to safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font2"> pioneer has been faithfully bearing the Kingdom message in the Fiji islands, finding many hearing ears among the Indians and Fijians, whereas the Europeans usually treat the message with contempt. Religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have become angered because those humble people are hearing the truth, and our pioneer brother was recently arrested and charged with acting in a manner prejudicial to the pubhe safety, etc. Natives were brought into the court who swore falsely that this brother had advised them not to pay their taxes. He was convicted and fined £25 and three months’ jail. An appeal has been lodged, and the result is not at present known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace another boat has been provided for the Islands, and it is hoped that this craft will soon be in active service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outstanding event of the year was unquestionably the Washington broadcast of June 2. This speech was received in Australia by means of overseas beam telephone and was rebroadcast from twenty Australian stations. The receiving times were 6 a.m., 5: 30 a.m., and 4 a.m., in the various parts of the country. These, unfortunately, are not good times to expect a large listening audience. We were hampered considerably in that the postmaster general would give no decision as to whether the lecture could be rebroadcast. Finally an appeal was made to the acting prime minister, who took action to force a decision in our favor a few days prior to the broadcast. The same </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font2">culty was experienced in connection with the repeat broadcast on June 9 given specially for Australian listeners. On this occasion Brother Rutherford’s lecture “Government” was picked up from shortwave station W2XAF, Schenectady, and rebroadcast by twelve Australian stations. The transmission was exceptionally clear, the hour of reception being 9 to 10 p.m. in eastern Australia and 7 to 8 p.m. in western Aus<sup>: </sup>tralia. Everyone who heard these lectures was thrilled with the message, as evidenced by the letters and telegrams received from all parts. New Zealand friends had to rely on pic</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">g up the lecture either from the Australian rebroadcast or by shortwave direct from U. S. A Reports indicate that quite a number in New Zealand heard the message. It is hoped that Australia will be enabled to participate in many more worldwide programs. Rebroadcasts of programs originating from foreign countries are prohibited in Australia unless they are first submitted for censorship. We anticipate no difficulty, however, if the program comes via Britain as did the June 2 broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year opened with 25 stations broadcasting the lectures, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">total of stations being used throughout the year. At the close of the year there were 23 stations broadcasting. It was found that one or two dishonestly took the money for our programs and through fear of men faded out portions of the lectures which they thought would give offense. These have been definitely dropped from the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conventions have been held at three points du</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ring</span><span class="font2"> the year, namely, Auckland, New Zealand, and Melbourne and Brisbane. Service was the keynote of each convention, and everyone enjoyed the discussions to promote greater efficiency in the work with the sound equipment. At each of these cities a public transcription lecture was held in a cinema and advertised extensively. Microphone announcements through the transcription machines were found to be most effective. The numbers attending the lectures were, Auckland and Melbourne, 1,000 each, and Brisbane, 450.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The enemy has shown his hand on several occasions, but most of his activities have been quiet and underhand. The clergy go to the homes of the people and advise them to have nothing to do with the books and to burn them. They succeed in influencing some, who show goathke disposition when Jehovah’s witnesses call. The broadcasting of the “Universal War Near’’ lecture at Bendigo angered the clergy bo that they threatened to protest to the director of posts and telegraphs. A special campaign was organized and the town given a thorough witness from door to door. At the same time a petition protesting against the action of the clergy was circulated, and invitations were issued by leaflet to the lecture “Universal War Near” to be presented in a local cinema. About 500 people attended the lecture, the advertising for which had been done mainly by microphone announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the Bendigo campaign was in progress, news was received that the police had ordered a party of pioneers to leave the town of Horsham, 150 miles from Bendigo. A detachment of pioneers immediately left Bendigo for Horsham and, after giving a list of their names to the police and informing them Of their intention to preach the gospel in Hors</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ham,</span><span class="font2"> they completely worked the town without further interference. Thus by putting on a bold front the Devil was defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font2"> each instance where trouble arises the hand of the clergy is seen. A spokesman of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who regularly broadcasts answers to questions by radio has occasionally attacked the truth, and without doubt he is being well supplied with information from the Hierarchy's propaganda bureau. Now that Australia’s Catholic prime minister has returned from paying his respects to the pope, we may expect Gog to combine his political and religious representatives in an effort to prevent the message from going forth. Whatever man or devil may do, the brethren in this territory are determined by the Lord's grace to faithfully press on in the fight until the whole of the Devil’s crowd is smitten to the dust by Jehovah’s Executioner at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In conclusion, we desire to express appreciation of the manner in which our activities have been assisted by the brethren at headquarters. It must be a tremendous undertaking to supply the literature for each country, and even though we are in the remotest part of the earth, our needs are always catered for and received in good time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It has been under the greatest difficulties and opposition encountered from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that Jehovah’s witnesses have prosecuted the work in Austria. The brethren in Austria have shown zeal and a keen determination to represent the Lord and his kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font3">dst, all the trials and persecutions that have come upon them. The following excerpt is taken from the report of the director of service in that country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The difficulties have increased more and more in this land, but even so we rejoice greatly to have a share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and give the Lord thanks that he continually provides us with strengthening food by which we are encouraged to work for the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom. Some become discouraged, but we must expect this as shown by the Gideon picture, while others go courageously forward in the strength and joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About a year ago this office was advised that the Society was dissolved and our activity forbidden; that, before previously being heard. We protested against this, and the American ambassador, who was informed by Brother Harbeck, also intervened for the Society, and after a few months this decision was withdrawn. Meanwhile </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> were forbidden and some booklets were confiscated. Immediately following the withdrawal of the prohibition against the Society by the Federal chancellor, a large quantity of books and booklets were seized. These booklets had, as prescribed by the Austrian Press Law, been presented to the authorities, several already many years ago, without the slightest difficulty resulting. The confiscation in practically every case took place, as the accompanying proceedings proved, at the instigation of the Catholic clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Soon after the Federal Chancellery had withdrawn the order of dissolution, there appeared a number of very similar Catholic newspaper articles, almost at the same time, in which the authorities were requested to do something against us, or else the people were called upon to defend themselves. A little later, on the 6th of July, the decree by the “ Sicherheitsdirek-tor” was again communicated, that our Society was instantly dissolved. Here again no preliminary hearing was given, which is contrary to law. Without receiving an opportunity for our defense, the office was sealed before the inventory list could be finished. At the same time, under threat of a term of imprisonment from six months up and a fine from S2,500 up, every activity was forbidden. We have appealed to the “Sicher-heitsdirektor ’ ’ on account of the dissolution of the Society and to the Police with regard to the confiscation of the property. Later the Police seizure of the property was repealed, the key returned to us, and it is again at our disposal, even though all activity remains prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Immediately after the Catholic gove</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">rnm</span><span class="font2">ent was installed our brethren were sorely persecuted, and although the Federal chancellor continually emphasizes that there is complete freedom of faith and conscience in Austria, which is also incorporated in the Constitution, the difficulties in every way have increased. Without cause or excuse the Bible lectures were forbidden. Many brethren were arrested and sentenced because they published the good hews of God's kingdom. In Salzburg and Tyrol a large number of brethren were instantly Sentenced to ten days’ arrest. A Jonadab has been now for three months in custody in Salzburg under examination, and at last the trial has been fixed; he is accused of blasphemy and religious disturbance, because he distributed the booklets which contain the good news of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Likewise in Salzburg and in the neighborhood there were two funerals arranged by our friends. As the relatives of the deeeased and the friends arrived at the cemetery, they were prevented from entering by the Constabulary and the Fire Brigade—it was forbidden that even a few words of comfort be given. In the one ease even the relatives were not allowed to enter the cemetery and the co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffin</span><span class="font2"> was just buried by the gravedigger. The priest at this place had taken his stand at the entrance to the cemetery, and he was surrounded by police constables. The brother was also hindered when he desired to give at least a short prayer outside the cemetery. When the priest saw that his arrangements did not receive general approval and that the feeling was against </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font2">, he quickly left the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Formerly we had but little difficulty in Salzburg, as also the political authorities in Austria were on the whole friendly toward us. Since the new bishop is in Salzburg high prison sentences are imposed on our brethren there. It is a joy to report, however, that the true witnesses do not allow themselves to become discouraged, but they rejoice to prove their integrity also under </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font2">culties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A sister notified her withdrawal from the Catholic church, and after a while she was invited to appear and was questioned as to her reasons (which is not aceoiding to law). She gave a witness and after a time was notified that her withdrawal was not recognized, the reason being that she did not believe in an </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font2">ortal soul, etc., and from this it could be seen that she was confused and obviously under the influence of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We rejoice to report, however, that in spite of these difficulties 207,699 books and booklets, 736 Bibles, and 102,549 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> could be distributed by 476 publishers in 62,206 hours, while during the previous year 626 publishers in 82,378 hours had placed 266,854 books and booklets, 99,876 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> and 802 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Considering the difficulties encountered, the brethren in Austria have done splendidly. This year they placed even more bound books than last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lately there were also 30 phonographs and transcription machines put into activity, but so far we can give no report on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As regards the pioneer work, only one sister has been able to continue in this work in Austria, and she must work very cautiously, but is very persevering and reports interesting experiences. Many people tell her that only since this work has been forbidden have they really taken notice of it, and now gladly take the literature. Others say: &quot;A year ago we laughed over this matter, but now see quite differently and are glad to be able to obtain Some of this reading matter.' ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We thank Jehovah for his grace and for the protection which he provides for us, and are happy to know that he himself will vindicate his great name in that he will destroy all his enemies. We rejoice that we are permitted to serve </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font2">, and desire to be used further and forever in his service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The country of Belgium has a population of only about seven million persons, and a greater number of these are designated &quot;Catholic population” and are under the oppressive thumb of the Hierarchy, The people are humble and doubtless would quickly take to the truth were it not for their self-assumed bosses, who through the priests of the Roman Catholic organization have long kept them in subjection. Only a small number of Jehovah’s witnesses reside in that land. There are 13 companies, the largest of which is at Brussels. Only 92 persons partook of the Memorial. During the fiscal year they served in the field 7,811 hours, and distributed literature as follows: Books, 635; booklets, 31,294; Bibles, 80; copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> 3,220. The local director of service reports, and the following is extracted from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close of the financial year 1934 we looked joyfully and with courage to the future, and yet we could not prevent one anxiety about the progress of the work here, for, as you know, the residence of the pioneers here was endangered. It was ungrounded, however, for while at the end of 1934 only 6 pioneers remained here in the service, now there are again 15, of whom 14 are of foreign nationality. We give Jehovah the praise for this provision, and through the whole year his care has never failed us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the beginning of the year the pioneer work in Belgium Buffered a relapse, as several foreign brethren were expelled. With the beginning of the Brussels Exhibition, however, the circumstances changed a little for their good, so that now a larger number are active again. On the average, there were 10 pioneers engaged in the field, but now we have a total of 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hours attained by the pioneers and auxiliaries amount to 16,597; literature distributed: 1,334 books and 61,262 booklets, together with 7,074 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies, 53 new subscriptions, and 76 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Orders for Eterature received in this office from interested persons have been more than in any previous year. In all, we sent 495 bound books, 9,005 booklets, 1,644 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font2">copies (apart from subscriptions), and 59 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The total amount of hterature distributed in Belgium in the 24,408 hours attained is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1,969 books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,294 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">92,556 booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53 subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">156 Bibles</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Jonadab class now begins to show itself. We receive constantly very pleasing letters—the people of good will have had enough of this old world. The unhappy death of - the queen of the Belgians has given many renewed proof that all the blessing of the CathoEe Hierarchy is of no avail. Spurred on by the report of the Washington convention, we will give the isolated Jonadabs still more attention. Of those who join the companies it is difficult to say where they belong, as they immediately manifest the same zeal as the witnesses themselves, if not more. Some show a greater appreciation than those who have been in the fighters’ ranks for some time already. The Brussels company has decided to consider the question whether one is a Jonadab or an anointed witness as quite a secondary matter, but to direct its whole attention to the vindication of the name of our God. The place to which Jehovah appoints us is apparently the very best for us, as Brother Rutherford pointed out in Washington. Some have withdrawn themselves from the service. These are forming two classes, one opposing the work and joining the “evil servant’’ class, and the other withdrawing because of indifference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special service weeks have always been an occasion for extraordinary efforts, so that the result of one such period was practicaUy always equal to the result of a regular month’s work. As an example, we mention the case of a 60-year-old sister who during the service period has never time to make her bed; in the eve</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g she is too tired to do so and sleeps very well, and in the morning she has other duties to perform before she can go out in the service. The total result reached by the companies in the six special service periods of this year is as follows: 3,004 hours, 142 bound books, 13,664 booklets, 645 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies, and 21 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 1st of September there was a service convention arranged in Brussels, and to this We were happy to have the visit of Brother Harbeck. There 110 friends participated in the service, while pioneers and service directors remained in the hall for an important conference. The total result in literature was: 750 booklets, 180 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies, 35 books, and 9 Bibles. In the afternoon there came many more interested friends, so that altogether 500 people listened to the explanations regarding the prophecy of Habakkuk. This day was one of great encouragement for us. Without one exception the pioneers were present, and it was a great refreshment' to them. Some came on their bicycles from distances of over 100 miles so as to save traveling expenses. Unfortunately, none of them can afford a car, which would help to lighten their service. They rent a room, m</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">akin</span><span class="font2">g this their center, and work within a radius of 15 miles, and, where circumstances make it necessary, even within 25 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Belgium there are two electrical transcription machines in use. Begarding one of these we receive very encouraging reports. Jonadabs are working with this machine; they are sons of a Mordecai who already before the war was proclaiming the Kingdom in Belgium. They spent 27 days of 10 hours each in this service, and with an attendance of 3,595 they placed 369 booklets, 79 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies, 7 books and 1 Bible. The machine is mounted on a tneyele. Without knowing with whom he was spea</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">g, a man told a brother how beautifully the Kingdom was being proclaimed in the market place in Liege by means of a transcription machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are also some phonographs in use here, and we have received reports of 45 such meetings with an attendance of 345.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most thrilling thing that I have ever experienced was when the message of the Kingdom was heard in Brussels direct from Washington. It was with difficulty that we controlled our nerves as we heard first the announcement, followed by the song of praise and then the clear voice of Brother Buther-ford. The Brussels brethren do not understand English, but at no cost would they miss this great event. The powerful voice as well as the continual applause of the attendance at Washington made them to understand that an important message was being broadcast to the ends of the earth. Immediately following we confirmed the good reception by cablegram. The lecture had been relayed by telephone lines from London to Brussels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At present there is a World Exhibition in Brussels. By your permission we there rented a stand for supplying our books as well as two show-windows for exhibiting the same. A large shield with the inscription &quot;Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, editors of Jehovah’s witnesses’’ advertises our stand. Experiences of every kind are had there, and up to now 1,500 publications have been placed on contribution. Many returned to get more, while others came to the office to obtain the whole series of books. Thousands of catalogues are given free to the passers-by. Some said: “This is truly the best we have found in the Exhibition.” Many “crows” pass by! One after having looked at the books asked in a fierce voice: “Are you allowed to sell these books here?” We replied: “And for what reason should it not be permitted to sell these books here?” and thereupon he went. Another one was more tolerant and said kindly: “I know these books from Judge Euth-erford; I brought them from America and read them”; he preferred, however, not to express an opinion about them. Still another one, as he held the books in his hand looking them over, suddenly let them fall as though smitten by a stroke, when he saw what books they were, saying: “I am not allowed to read these books . . . no, I may not do this ...” He looked as anxious as a child who awaits a drubbing from his mether. In the windows there are placards pointing to the establishment of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom; these are often read with great attention. It would really take too much time and space to recount all the happy experiences we have had with people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our books are also exhibited in 35 languages in two showwindows in the Pavilion of “Graphic Arts”. Here we were awarded the Silver Medal. We do not wish to obtain rewards for selfish purposes, as is the case with other exhibitors; however, these are a help in our fight for the right to preach the gospel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year we have had less difficulty with the police. A parcel of literature forwarded by rail had to be fetched by the receiver from the police office. The police having been informed about this, it had been confiscated. In the presence of the police commissioner this then had to be opened. The official first asked certain questions, which gave the brother an opportunity of telling him about the Kingdom. Thereupon the brother was dismissed. He wanted to leave the official some literature, but to his astonishment the man replied: “I know quite weU what this is, for I have read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font2"> and various other booklets. I wish that all shall come to pass as these books indicate; just continue the work, and I will give order that you be no more molested. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One pioneer had to appear before a judge because he went from house to house without a permit. The Catholic mayor of that place demanded of the judge that he be punished. A discussion ensued between the judge and the mayor; finally the former banged the table With his fist saying: “I am the judge; this man is free; he does a good work. Perhaps you would hke that all the Catholic hubs be denounced, for they go from house to house I ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With particular satisfaction the witnesses of Jehovah in Belgium, acting in complete harmony with those of the whole world, on October 7, 1934, sent a telegram to the Hitler Government, to help our brethren who are being persecuted in that country. A few post offices refused to accept the same; where refused, the telegram was immediately forwarded per express letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Ypres, which town was completely brought to ruins in the World War, and which is now rebuilt, there is a company of 10 Jonadabs; they were baptized in the sea. The house in Which they meet to study in this completely Catholic town is now known as the “Bible House”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total literature dispatched: 2,758 books, 114,521 booklets, 13,286 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies, 214 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Letters: 1,451 received; 1,637 dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are determined to further serve the Lord faithfully. The explanations in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> are highly appreciated here. After studying an article we are always inclined to say, “This is the best ever.” AH the companies study </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> zealously, and for months past I do not remember having heard a single critic, but only joy and wonderment about the logic of Jehovah’s truth. We give Jehovah all honor for the food provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BLIND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font3">The Society endeavors to get the Kingdom message to those who are blind in their natural eyes and who desire to know about God and his provision for humankind. To this end the branch is maintained at 1210 Spear street, Logansport, Indiana, where printing is done in the Braille. This work is necessarily limited, because not so many of the blind persons are interested. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is published in the Braille and loaned to the blind by the Society’s office above mentioned, and in addition thereto the following booklets: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People, Dividing the People, Angels, Desirable Government, The Kingdom the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font3"> The pioneers, auxiliaries and company publishers everywhere coming in contact with blind persons who are interested in the Kingdom should put them in communication with the Society’s branch office at the above address and inform them that they can get assistance in Bible study by writing this office, and also by taking their subscription for the circulating library for the blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the companies are putting forth a greater effort to reach the blind. In Los Angeles a library for the benefit of the blind is kept, in which the publications are circulated amongst those who are blind. During the year this company at Los Angeles has loaned the literature to 65 blind people. Three of these are subscribers for the Braille </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> The company at Los Angeles sends out visitors to call on the blind to encourage them in their studies. The phonograph records are being used to splendid effect in this work. In this connection we urge the companies in various places to look after the blind people and encourage them in studying the message of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s branch at Logansport has furnished </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in Braille during the year to 30 readers. In addition thereto </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is sent in Braille to Australia, South Africa, Canada, and other places. Recently the requests' from the Chicago Library have been more than could be met in furnishing reading matter for the blind. We are glad of the increased interest in this behalf.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Publishing the Kingdom message in Brazil is progressing. There are now 9 pioneers, 2 auxiliaries and 50 company publishers regularly engaged in the service. This is a small number compared with the greatness of the territory; yet with these there has been a good advertisement of the Kingdom. During the year there were placed in the hands of the people 40,863 books and booklets. The work has been handicapped somewhat, due to the faet that a proper t</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">rans</span><span class="font3">lator could not he obtained to translate the literature as rapidly as it could be used. We hope this can be improved shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Like every other part of the field, Satan, through his instruments, the clergy, has interfered in every way possible to prevent the work. Some of these clergymen issue papers naming all the publications of the Kingdom message and speak against them, but that in truth and in fact advertises the books and many people inquire about them and in this way more are placed. Thus the Lord makes their wrath work to his own praise. The population of Brazil is largely Portuguese, and there is not so much literature in the Portuguese language as we should like. We are looking for some good translator to increase this part of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has blessed the English-speaking people with far greater opportunities of service than any other people on the earth. Just why, we cannot surely say, but it seems that more of the English-speaking people than others desire to know Jehovah and his kingdom. The message of the Kingdom has had a wider publication in the English-speaking countries than any other part of the earth. According to population the United States stands at the head, and Britain is next. That must have a deep significance. Jehovah has commanded the remnant of his earthly organization to carry the message of warning to the people, and, this being done, there rests upon the people who do hear a greater responsibility. The English-speaking people have been more favored than any other with a knowledge of the truth. They have been students of the Bible, and others have not. The truth places before everyone who hears it the issue of life and death, and each one must assume the responsibility of choosing which course he will take. Each one therefore has much to do with fixing his own destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A people that thinks less of self, of course, will think more of the Lord and the opportunity of serving him. A people that is much concerned about its selfish interests will give little heed to things pertaining to God’s purpose. It is those who love righteousness and hate iniquity who want to know Jehovah and do his will, and such he has taken out of the world as a people for his name. The number thus taken out is small, as compared with the whole population. The witnesses who are ehosen must bear the responsibility of getting the message to the people. It is a real joy to see how the brethren are responding to the opportunities of service. Each year they see more clearly that God’s purpose has been and is to select from amongst men certain ones who are commissioned to be his witnesses and each one commissioned must perform his duty by bringing the message of truth before others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time was when many of the brethren in Britain understood that their chief objective was to shine before their brethren and exhibit their own understanding of the Scriptures and teach others. Now the ones really devoted to the Lord see that the chief purpose of their being on earth and possessing a knowledge of the truth is to bear testimony before others that Jehovah is God, and that his kingdom is the only hope of the world. Those who thus do and continue faithful will participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and the vindication of his name is the all-important question. Those who do prove their integrity toward God by faithfully serving him now will be the ones who shall be forever in his glorious presence and share the blessings that the Most High will bestow upon his royal house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is always a real pleasure to visit the British brethren and to participate with them in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was not the privilege of the president during this fiscal year to make the usual journey to Europe, but the Lord provided opportunity to speak to the European brethren by the modern means of transmitting speech. Now it is a happy task to be permitted to report the activities of those who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom in that part of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The territory covered by Britain is small, and this somewhat handicaps the brethren, because not all can find sufficient territory for the pioneer service. The zeal of the remnant and their companions has been shown as never before in that land, and now comes the report at the end of the fiscal year showing a wider witness even than heretofore. The witness work for the Kingdom during the fiscal year was blessed by the Lord, and the publishers in Britain placed in the hands of the people books and booklets published by the Society to the total number of 3,060,667 volumes. In joyfully doing this the brethren went from house to house and spoke to the people, using phonograph, transcription and sound cars to reproduce the speech that had been made and recorded in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work at London is well organized, and the brethren in charge have been working in complete unity. The directors of service at London have filed their usual annual report, and the following is quoted therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The continued activity of the British friends and the manifest blessing of Jehovah on his kingdom work in this portion of his field is cause for deep gratitude to him and joy of heart to all who are privileged to share in the work. The evidences of Jehovah’s assisting grace during the twelve months closing the 30th of September 1935 are so numerous that it is. impractical to record them all. One outstanding example, however, we must record, namely, the marvelous results following the effort made in this country to relay your now world-famous lecture “Government” from Washington on' June 2; 1935. In spite of the refusal of the' press to<sup>1</sup> carry the Society’s advertisement and the refusal of the British Broadcasting Corporation to relay reception from Washington, we were, by divine grace, able to arrange for large audiences in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, and Belfast, to hear perfectly every word delivered by you on that important occasion. Without doubt the brethren and Jonadabs throughout the British field were thrilled and stimulated to a remarkable degree by the evidence of divine favor afforded through the reception of that lecture, and the increased activity and results obtained are proof thereof. The interest created in the minds of the British public is also manifest through the fact that for the first time the output from this office has exceeded three million volumes. Fortunately your foresight provided that we should have ample stocks in hand, but the demand was such that the stock distributed amongst the companies has been greatly reduced during the twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The output of literature reveals a total of 3,060,667 volumes, which is an increase of 128,762 over last year’s figure. A significant fact to be noted is that the increase referred to is almost entirely due to bound volumes, for of the increase of 128,762 volumes, 126,535 were clothbound books. The evidence available proves conclusively that the increase of bound volumes in the limited territory of the British Isles is due to the fact of the transcription lectures given by transcription machines and phonographs working regularly in the public streets with the brethren as they witness from door to door, and, in addition, to the sound cars wor</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">g in the outlying territory which is not served by companies or sharpshooters. Not only docs the lecture thus broadcast stimulate the public, but it tlnills and cheers the publisher, and the increase of 22,427 hours is at least to some extent due to the stimulating effect of the lectures. In addition to the hours reported, a good many thousand hours are spent by the brethren operating the transcription machines and phonographs, which time is not included m the total given above. If this time were included the total hours spent would show an enormous increase over last year. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> has also to be taken into account, for the output of this volume, namely, 88,155 in ten months, exceeds by over 22,000, in twelve months, that of the bound volume previously issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The condition m the country during this year is very similar to our previous report. The possibility of a European war hangs like a heavy black cloud over the people. The politicians are administering oxygen in an effort to keep the League of Nations alive. The people as a whole appear to have little hope of the patient’s survival. The clergy are like rats deserting a fi</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nkin</span><span class="font2">g shipj they have -very little to nay about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is some evidence of the police authorities’ beginning to take a little more notice of the Kingdom work. So far we have had no interference at all, and the constables in the street have, in the majority of cases, proved friendly towards us. The transcription work, however, has caused the clergy class to bring a little more pressure to bear on the officers of the law, but during the twelve months only one case has been actually taken into court, and this was dismissed on the payment of ten shillings. The British friends appreciate the favorable conditions which at present prevail, and, united as never before, they are pressing the battle to the gate in no uncertain manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Service: There has been no general assembly of the brethren during the year, but 25 service assemblies have been held in convenient centers of the British field. One of the principal purposes of the meetings is that the brethren may unite together in publishing the good news of the Kingdom. All the assemblies were well supported by the local brethren, and 7,603 publishers went forth and in 15,836 hours placed 53,249 volumes with 31,305 members of the public. Time is always provided on the program for a meeting of the publishers to discuss organization methods and instructions. These meetings are very much appreciated by all who have the interests of the work at heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are 368 company and sharpshooter units equipped for service. These contain 5,496 publishers holding the Society’s certificate. Of these, 76 percent have taken a regular part in the service, to compare with 70 percent last year. The other 24 percent are engaged in the transcription work. So the result is then that the British friends are practically 100 percent active publishers. The total of 575,945 hours devoted by the company and sharpshooter publishers to advise the King and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom is 966 over last year’s figure. There is a decrease in the total obtainers, the figure being 1,203,661, to compare with 1,509,566 last year. This is due to the fact that the British friends now offer either a combination of three bound books or three booklets instead of a single volume or a single booklet. This method is one of the reasons why 179,573 bound volumes were placed, to compare with 76,608 in the preceding twelve months: the total literature placed by the service publishers being 1,578,951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Transcription: The service of the sound cars has undoubtedly received Jehovah’s approval and blessing. Of the three which were built and equipped to your instructions, two have been operating continuously for twelve months, and the third </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">ten months. The fourth was equipped by </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">brother and placed at the disposal of the Society, and this has been in active service for only one month. They have traveled a total of 14,857 miles, three working in England, and one in Scotland. During 8,605 hours they have given 5,015 lectures, to an attendance of 56,274. With the interested who heard these lectures they placed 16,128 bound volumes, 17,856 booklets and 172 Bibles; a total of 34,156 volumes, to compare with 14,210 in the previous twelve months, In the highlands of Scotland No. 3 sound car placed 54 bound volumes jn one day; and 241 bound volumes and 83 booklets in the week. In a small village on the east coast of England No. 4 sound car placed 209 bound volumes and 286 booklets in one week. The figures we have available show conclusively that one pioneer in a sound car is 200 percent more efficient in placing the literature, per hour, than one pioneer without the advantage of the transcription lecture. In addition, the public have the testimony of the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company and sharpshooter groups are gradually equipping themselves with the latest transcription machines and horn projectors or else with a phonograph. There are now 192 groups operating either one or more machines, to compare with 103 last year. The total of machines in the country in active operating has increased from 227 to 269 during the year. These machines are equipped with 4,813 16-inch lecture records, to compare with 3,969 in the previous year. A total of 346 brethren have equipped themselves with a phonograph, and 9,650 phonograph discs are in active service, to compare with 900 last year. The number of meetings recorded is 44,675, an increase of 31,506 as compared with last year, and the attend<sup>1 </sup>anee of 938,312 shows an increase of 437,765 interested persons. Letters received not only from interested listeners, but from the publishers operating the machines, prove what a joy this part of the Kingdom service is bringing, both to the operator and to those who receive the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 29th of September throughout the British Isles over 1,000 lectures were given with the &quot;Government” record in the open air. The full reports are not yet to hand, but there is evidence that the attendance at these lectures will surpass anything we have obtained for lectures arranged previously in halls. Schedules were arranged and, in spite of a wet day, 'every man stood in his place.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bethel family with one heart and one voice continue to use time and opportunity in every part of the Kingdom service. Fully equipped with the latest transcription apparatus they visit regular pitches on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, in addition to their week-end service in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The office staff are never so happy as when serving the interests of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The correspondence this year shows a decrease both in the number of letters dispatched and in that received; nevertheless we received 40,848 and posted 52,868. There is an increase in the number of small parcels packed and dispatched, the figure this year being 29,178, to compare with 27,011. There has been an additional demand on the printing department, the items printed having so far reached the record figure of 4,385,795, an increase of 591,989 items. In preparing for the radio folders for the 29th of September referred to above we printed 949,360 items, which is over 100,000 more than we have done in any month before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers: We continue to have more applicants for the pioneer service than it is possible -for us to place on the limited area of the British Isles. We have an average of 204 full-time pioneers, and these placed a total of 727,501 pieces of literature, which is an increase of 20,027 over last year, the increase being entirely bound books. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font2"> one would expect, there is a Blight decrease in the booklets placed. Last year there was a small decrease in the number of hours, but this year we are happy to report a small increase. In addition to the pioneers we have an average of 100 auxiliaries, and these placed 185,970 bound volumes in 62,264 hours. This is a decrease on the literature placed last year, but at that time we had 120 auxiliaries in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> file shows that 744 additional subscribers have been added during the year and, in addition, 27,408 copies have been supplied to Jonadabs and others who do not subscribe annually. Without exception the remnant people of God eagerly look for the regular supply of life-susta</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">inin</span><span class="font2">g food. As each new issue is received one is reminded of the words of Jesus, &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The circulation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> shows a slight increase over last year. The single copies supplied show a very large increase, having reached the number of 43,799. The reason of this remarkable increase is undoubtedly due to the appreciation of the brethren and the Jonadabs of the article containing an account of the great convention at Washington and of all that took place there, as well as many inspiring articles showing how the Lord as protecting,-guiding and directing his people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The work in British Guiana has made some progress during the year, and for this we are grateful to the Lord. There are only 28 workers in the field and not all of these put in any great length of time. During the year there were placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 14,758; 145 public meetings were held, the attendance being 7,268; 156 company meetings were held. The sound equipment has aided much in the work in that country as well as in other places.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Society’s branch office at Toronto, Canada, is in better shape than at any time in the past. It is better equipped to do the work, and there is an increased zeal in the service. Heretofore the workers have been required to live in different places, but during this fiscal year quarters have been prepared for the entire working staff to live as one family; and therefore there is now established in Toronto a regular Bethel home. Thus the brethren who work there are enabled to begin the day by the morning service similar to that at the Brooklyn Bethel. Each one feels more encouraged than ever to bend his or her endeavors toward the magnifying of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The zeal for the Lord has been steadily maintained and in fact stronger throughout the various provinces of Canada during the year than in the past. The brethren appreciate the fact that the Kingdom is here, that Jehovah and Christ Jesus, their Teachers, provide now the food convenient for them, that they can see what is quickly coming to pass and the obligation is laid upon every one to bear testimony to the truth. Seeing this, they gird up the loins of their mind and press forward in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again we are reminded that the &quot;uneireumcised Philistines”, that is to say, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, exercise a tremendous power in Canada, and particularly in the province of Quebec. Fully 90 percent of the population of that province are under the direct control of the Hierarchy, and hence are called Catholics. They are Catholics because they have had no opportunity to know anything different. The Hierarchy has kept them in darkness and desperately fights to prevent them from hearing the truth, because the truth would open their eyes and cause the people to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and forsake the Devil’s organization. Fear has been planted in the minds of the people in that province, and they know literally nothing except to bow before the hypocritical gangsters that rule through the Catholic Hierarchy. The political and judicial officers are largely influenced by the Hierarchy, and therefore little or no justice may be expected where the issue is between the truth and the Hierarchy. The people are instructed that they must show their devotion to the &quot;church”; otherwise they will suffer materially and spiritually and their duration in purgatory will probably not end. A vast amount of money is invested in church property, convents and such institutions, while the people are compelled to reside in humble homes, often living in poverty, and so reduced to this condition by reason of the constant contributions that are forced from them to the church. Not only has the proclamation of the truth in that province met with opposition, but it has been almost impossible to communicate the message of the Kingdom to the people. Many of the brethren have, at the risk of their liberty and even their lives, gone into the territory in obedience to the Lord’s command to serve the message of warning upon the people. The priests of the Hierarchy denounce Jehovah’s witnesses as Communists and enemies of the government, and they are constantly publishing lies against God’s witnesses. The priests organize school children into mobs and follow Jehovah’s witnesses about, shouting and inciting men to assault them. In spite of these conditions many of the younger people are getting their eyes open to the hypocrisy and tyranny of the Roman Catholic system. The Lord will see to it that they have an opportunity to break away and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year there have been eleven prosecutions of Jehovah’s witnesses in the courts, and these cases have been stubbornly fought by the representatives of the state. Brethren have been charged with seditious conspiracy, this charge being based upon the fact of their distribution of the Society’s publications announcing Jehovah as the true God, Christ as King, and the Kingdom as the only hope of suffering humanity. The punishment inflicted upon the brethren that have been convicted has been from two weeks to two months in prison. The prisons of Quebec are unsanitary, filthy and infested with vermin. The arrest included young women, who were thrown into these filthy prisons. On one occasion two sisters were arrested, immediately taken to the private residence of the magistrate, and, without even knowing that they were on trial, they were sentenced to eight days in jail. As an instance showing how the Catholic-Hierarchy priests influence public officials the following is related: The brethren were tried before a magistrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Insufficient evidence caused the dismissal of the case. The cost bill of $91 was against the town. The council refused to pay it, but demanded that the mayor do so because the mayor had directed the driving of Jehovah’s witnesses out of town. The mayor replied that the priest had told him to do what he had done and thus the priest should pay the bill. The man who had committed the assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses said that the next time the priests wanted any dirty work done they would have to do it themselves so far as he Was concerned. Two brethren convicted in the local courts of Quebec of the “crime of seditious conspiracy’’ appealed their case to the Supreme Court of the province. An ardent Catholic of the Supreme Bench rendered the opinion, and his quotation from the literature, taking isolated sentences out of their setting and misapplying them, and his final finding upon the law and the facts, is really a disgrace to the legal profession. The conviction was affirmed. The cases then were appealed to the Dominion Supreme Court of Canada, where they are now pending. Regardless of what should be the final result of these cases, it affords an opportunity for the brethren to maintain their integrity under stress and at the same time to bear witness to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Persecutions of Jehovah’s witnesses in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have been carried on vigorously by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in those places, particularly amongst the Ukrainians. These hypocritical priests have incited the ignorant to assault the brethren. On one occasion their camp was destroyed. On another occasion the priests broke up the meeting and threw decayed eggs at Jehovah’s witnesses. On another occasion they organized a mob, who disguised themselves by painting their faces and putting on old clothes and, armed with tin pans, fiddles and like noise-making instruments, met Jehovah’s witnesses at the railway station and endeavored to put them to shame and ridicule by following them about and making unearthly noises. The tires on the automobiles of the brethren had been cut and other damage done to their property. Many persons are aware of the fact that the Catholic Hierarchy are back of these persecutions and have told their hearers that they may kill Jehovah’s witnesses 'without fear of sin. It is manifest that these goats have taken their firm stand on the side of the Devil and will not be moved. Their end is certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses, regardless of the place, have the spirit of the Lord, and therefore are all of the same spirit. They know that they must submit to persecution from Satan and his agents and that they must maintain their integrity under such stress. For this reason they go joyfully on, singing the praises of the Most High and proclaiming his kingdom, giving warning to the people. The director of service from the Canadian branch office has well summed up the matter as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite the tremendous opposition of Satan and his forces against the proclamation of the Kingdom message in these lands, the total number of books and booklets placed during the year was 1,539,173, to compare with 1,537,572 last year. Of this number 116,394 were bound books, as against 107,924 last year. This literature was distributed amongst 812,949 ob-tainers, an increase of 49,519 over last year, and in 40 different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of publishers in the field averaged 2,218 per month, an increase of 258 as compared with 1,960 in 1934. To accomplish the splendid witness that was given these brethren spent 438,926 hours in the witnessing work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The policy of having special witness periods manifestly is one greatly blessed of the Lord as reflected in the results obtained and in the enthusiasm of the publishers in such service, an average of 90 percent having engaged in each of the special periods during the past year. The results were as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The pioneers in the field during the year averaged 159, to compare with 179 last year, while the greatest number in the service during any one month was 203. This faithful army has with characteristic zeal proclaimed the message all the way from Newfoundland to the Yukon and from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, averaging 112.4 hours each per month in the service. Not alone have they been active in placing the hterature, but they have effectively used the various kinds of sound equipment, the sound cars, transcription machines and phonographs, and it is interesting indeed to note the experiences they have had in connection with their work and how manifestly the Lord’s blessing is upon them and guiding them in all their ways. A field publisher reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We wish we could find words to express our appreciation of the wonderful provision of the phonograph. The more we use it and see the effect, the more we like it. Though poor as regards material things, we are surely wonderfully equipped for the Lord’s service, and all praise and tha</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font2"> -we know are due to Him. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The other day while we were in B----R--- an old man</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">came up to our house-car to see if we had hot dogs. We asked him inside and played some of the phonograph lectures. He said, ‘I hate religion, but those are the very best Bible talks I ever heard. Got all the preachers beat 1 ’ Then when we showed him the books and told him he could take some to his cabin he was delighted to take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government, Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> and some booklets. He had never heard of Brother Rutherford and had never been called on. He lives away in the hills and had come to B----R----to get his mail. Another time we played</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the records ‘Keys’ and ‘Trinity’ for a Catholic lady whoso husband has been reading the books and has had many arguments with her. She said right away, 'That is the truth. My husband has tried to tell me dozens of times, and I could not see it. I can now, and I want that record to show my Catholic friends, and as soon as we can get some money we will get all those records. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I believe that northern British Columbia will see great developments in the near future so far as the truth is concerned, because there are many of the 'great multitude’ who have taken their stand and others are coming along, among both the white people and the Indians. The latter especially showed greater confidence in our. visit this year than last, knowing that J. w’s come to help them and do not try to put anything over them.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The auxiliaries in the field, for some unaccountable reason, have never been great in numbers in this country. This year they averaged only 25.6 per month, but the hours spent totaled 15,582, an average of 50.7 each per month. Their placements totaled 56,061 books and booklets, of which number 4,233 were bound, to compare with 51,897 dunng 1934, of which number 3,939 were bound—a largw result this year despite the fact that there were on the average 8 fewer auxiliaries in the field per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the statement shows, the results for the companies and sharpshooters have been very gratifying, but, unlike the pioneers and auxiliaries, it is regrettable to note that their hours are much below the quota for this branch of the service. During 1935 they averaged but 8.5 hours each per month, spending a total of 208,799 hours in the field. The literature placed, however, totaled 852,169 books and booklets, to compare with 574,885 last year, of which number 34,833 were bound, to compare with 28,520. Great indeed has been the witness, but how much greater it would have been had the quota of hours been properly maintained! It is interesting to compare the results obtained by the companies and sharpshooters with those of the pioneers and auxiliaries. This comparison is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The whole of Canada and Newfoundland is fairly well covered by the American stations broadcasting the Kingdom message, and in addition thereto we are using seven stations in Canada. The outstanding witness during the past year was, of course, that delivered by yourself upon the occasion of the Washington convention. That bold and telling message was heard distinctly throughout this entire country and Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The stations at present being used in Canada, over which lectures from the Society’s publications are being read by local brethren, are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sydney, N. S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton, Ont.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclamation by Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is really wonderful, the way in which this work is spreading throughout the country and how rapidly the friends svery-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">where</span><span class="font2"> are becoming “sound-equipment—minded”. Sixteen sound cars are heralding forth the testimony with no uncertain tone, more than 115 transcription machines are consistently in operation, and hundreds of phonographs and records are being used by the individual publishers in the field work. There are now 295 machines in operation each month, to compare with but 126 last year, an increase of 169. During 1935 no less than 30,437 meetings were held, an increase of 24,987 over the past year, with a total audience of 433,280, to compare with 142,949 during 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Newfoundland, where a very large proportion of the people can neither read nor write, the sound car is especially effective; for in no other way is it possible to get the message to a large percentage of the people than by an oral lecture in some form. A field publisher reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Newfoundland is a country that particularly needs God’s kingdom. The educational system is almost entirely under church supervision, and as a consequence the people are not given an education. In many places as we go from door to door we meet three or four in succession who cannot even read the testimony card. The sound car is therefore the greatest aid we could possibly have, and since receiving it we have held two meetings each day. After the meeting today five people came up to the machine and asked for a booklet for one or two cents—all they can afford, for they are very, very poor. They coaxed us to pnt on a second meeting, and all the village listened. One old man stood at the side of the car and nodded his approval as each point was made. One lady said her husband came home from work at noon and said he had heard the lecture in the morning a mile away as plainly as if he were right up by the machine. In witnessing from door to door after the meeting we placed 115 booklets. On Tuesday we put on a meeting at S---- C----at 10: 00 a.m. and then</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">witnessed in the village. Nearly all told ub they had heard the lecture, and invited us in. We placed 75 booklets as a result. At practically every call we made they begged us to have another meeting, and we agreed to broadcast again at five o ’clock. When we got back to the car at that time there were over one hundred people standing around waiting for us, and as soon as we started the program the roads around were just lined with people sitting on logs or boats, listening. On another occasion a man donated $1.00 to help the work along. At B----</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and P---- the same keen interest was shown and the lecture</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">was heard one and a half miles away. Last night during the meeting at C---- the streets were crowded and all paid very</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">close attention. The sound car is surely the proper thing for t</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hia</span><span class="font2"> country, and everyone talks about anything new. So when that new thing is the Kingdom message and the means whereby it is spread abroad it makes us rejoice indeed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everywhere throughout Canada and Newfoundland this means of testifying is being felt, on the one hand arousing great interest and pointing the way of escape to those of good will, and on the other causing consternation among the ra</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font2"> of the enemy. Other publishers report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Since we have been using the sound car regularly in our town people are telling us they are reading the literature that has been lying on the shelf; and we </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font2"> it true, judging by their more intelligent conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The transcription work is being carried on enthusiastically here. The publishers are going out with the sound car and find it a great encouragement, and they are able to place more literature. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;We thank our dear God for this great opportunity to have a part in the vindication of his name. The machine works first-class, and it sure opens the people’s eyes out here. We will be on the road every chance we have from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;An old sister passed away recently, and for the funeral service we used the phonograph records ‘The Dead’ and 'Bes-urrection’. Neighbors who will not even accept free booklets were there and listened spellbound. A wonderful witness was given to the 70 people present, including the United Church preacher and his wife. We thank Jehovah for the phonograph records to enlighten the great multitude still in Satan’s organization. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all there were 138 conventions held, with an average of 57 publishers at each. These placed a total of 55,803 books and booklets, of which number 1,967 were bound books. The obtainera numbered 31,085, and the hours in the field, 19,575.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishing the message is carried on in fourteen languages in this land. Of the lahguages other than English there were 189.6 (average) monthly publishers active in the field, spending 48,240 hours and placing 104,876 pieces of literature, of which number 9,298 were bound books. This is much in excess of 1934, when there were but 141.8 (average) monthly workers, 30,764 hours spent in the field, and 56,638 books and booklets placed, of which 5,453 were bound. An increase has been shown in the number of French brethren active in the Kingdom woik, and their -efforts have been greatly blessed of the Lord. The average number of French publishers monthly was 21.6, and they placed 58,146 pieces of literature. It is good to note the number of Ukrainian brethren in the service. However, their zeal for the Kingdom is somewhat disappointing, for while they among the foreign nationalities have by far the largest number of publishers, namely, 117.7, their placements number only 29,702. What is true of the Ukrainian brethren is to a lesser degree true of the Polish also, who averaged 22 workers monthly and placed 7,455 pieces of literature. The publishers of other nationalities, while much fewer in number, gave a good testimony to Jehovah's praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Washington Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the Canadian friends attended the Washington convention and were richly blessed as a result. They came back greatly enthused and thrilled indeed by your message ‘' Government&quot;, and, in some respects, even more so by the light upon the subject of the &quot;great multitude&quot;, and spread the spint of the convention far and wide in this country, and thus in turn it became a great strength to the Lord’s people everywhere throughout this land. Those messages, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">articles, and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> beyond question have been the source of tremendous strength to the Lord’s people and have had much to do with the result that has been accomplished by the friends in proclaiming the message of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The economic conditions in Canada, like other parts of the earth, continue to grow worse. Millions of people there as elsewhere, will continue to pin their faith to earthly leaders, only to be sorely disappointed in the end. There is only one hope for the peoples of the earth, and that is God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>CENTRAL EUROPEAN BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">To facilitate the publishing work of the Kingdom in Central Europe an office is maintained at Berne, Switzerland, and designated the Central European branch. This branch office has immediate direction of the work over the following countries; Austria, Belgium, Danzig, France, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Rumania, Saar Basin, .Switzerland, The Netherlands, Yugoslavia. The director of service is in immediate communication with these countries, receives from each director a report every thirty days and transmits that to the president’s office at Brooklyn, whose privilege it is,to check over the reports every thirty days, including the financial condition, and to generally direct the work in these countries as the Lord provides the means. At the Berne office is maintained a printing plant, where books, booklets, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> and other literature of the Society are published and distributed throughout the countries under the immediate jurisdiction of the Central European office. At this point we set out the facts applying generally to the territory embraced in the Central European office, and a Separate report for each of the countries will be found in their regular alphabetic order. The director of service at the Central European branch has well summed up the matter, and the following excerpts are taken from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past year’s work was especially marked with signs of incieasing difficulty along the entire battle front. In almost every land under the jurisdiction of this office the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has made itself manifest. This power of Rome has ever fought institutions standing for freedom, has constantly persecuted and destroyed truly devoted and God-fearing men, and this always under the cloak of a religious name. In truth, the tactics of this great ecclesiastical institution have remained the same as in the Middle Ages, and their thirst for blood has not been stilled. (Details to be found in reports from various lands ) Often it may seem that the influence of this power is on the increase, for it has apparently succeeded in different lands in crushing and hindering the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, the difficulties of the brethren brought about by this organization of darkness have not in any way dampened their courage and joy. An ardor and zeal has been kindled in the hearts of the hearers of the message, which no earthly power is able to extinguish. The millions of pieces of literature in Central Europe as well as the literature placed again this past year witness to a living and fearless activity on the part of this insignificantly smaD number of people, in comparison with the millions of inhabitants in these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With great thankfulness and deep joy it is our privilege to report that the witness work in the territory of the Central European branch has gone forward, even though the strong arm of the state in some lands has forbidden the message of the Kingdom. In Austria during the last half year not as much could be done owing to the dissolution of the Society decreed in July. This occurred also in Danzig three months ago, and the Saar Basin was returned to Germany last March. Then in France, where the pioneers formerly numbered 100, many were chased out of the country; and Belgium, to which some have fled, gives foreign mission-workers only a few months ’ permission to remain in the country. In Rumania the witness work has also been hindered, the literature having been confiscated at various times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, it is with great joy that we report the result of the combined activity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">669,200 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;681,489 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">119,566 books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,479 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> subs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1,741,749 booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,711 Bibles</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The entire territory numbers 417 organized companies; 10,537 attended the Memorial celebration, 8,258 partaking of the emblems. During The Anointed's Thanksgiving Period, 5,388 took part in the service; 500 Jonadabs are included in this number, as well as pioneers and auxiliaries. The highest number of pioneers active during the year was 163; this number sank to 132 toward the end' of the year. Auxiliaries number from 34 to 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The spiritual condition of the companies in all these lands is maiked as being healthy. The 'Elders Epoch' has disappeared, and nearly all recognize that the greatest of their privileges is an active part in the witness work. We can hardly expect a larger number of hours, because in the previous year, when every land was active, the total was only 90,000. In spite of the curtailment of the work in Austria for the past three months, that in the Saar Basin for six months, and in Danzig for two months, the number of hours reached a total of 421,135, making an increase of 21,404 over last year, or 111,673 more than that of two years ago. There were 63,666 books placed, an increase of 13,000 over last year; 1,134,749 booklets, an increase of 56,106. Aside from this, 538,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies were distributed and 1,632 new subscriptions obtained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneer work is directed from Berne, except in the case of Poland and Rumania; this because of language differences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of pioneers has decreased from an average of 170 to 147; the auxiliaries, from 70 to 42. The reason for this is the continued expulsion of the foreign brethren, as already stated. Some of these we could send to Belgium, but the most chose to go to Spain, and others back to the home country. In spite of this hindrance in the pioneer force, the number of hours spent in the service, and the placement of literature, is marvelous. The average of 147 pioneers and 42 auxiliaries accomplished the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">248,010 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;607,000 booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">55,900 books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;143,009 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The average time per pioneer and month is 126 hours (minimum 110), but in some countries the pioneers have put in over 200 hours a month. In connection with this, we call attention to the great distances covered by foot or on bicycles and over very bad roads in such countries as Yugoslavia, Poland and Prance. Keeping this in mind, next year we will compile statistics of mileage covered by pioneers in their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Week Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The time spent in the service during the Special Service Period program represents 34 percent of the year’s total, and 35.5 percent of the total literature placement was made in these special service periods. The -following is the result of the six special service periods:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This increase is especially refreshing, considering that the work in Austria, in the Saar Basin and in Danzig has been crippled and in B</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">um a</span><span class="font2">m a the brethren could be active in only three of these service periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service with Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are glad to report that this branch of the Lord’s work, in spite of many hindrances, has made progress. Beports show that 1,431 meetings have been held, with an attendance of 34,296, who heard the message of the Kingdom. 497,000 leaflets as invitations to these meetings were used, whereby a witness also was given. The lectures were heard with interest and joy by the majority, and the brethren greatly appreciate this new means of witnessing, making use of it as opportunity offers. At the present time m our territory there are 40 large loudspeakers and 240 phonographs in use. Most of the records used are made in our own studio in Berne. The technician in the factory where copies are made for us pronounces the originals as very good, show</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font2"> that the Lord blesses the efforts of his children even though they are only amateurs. We hope tp obtain increasing success with this means of service in the coming year, giving more attention to this branch of the Lord's work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As reported last year, a number of young people ranging in age from 15 to 25 years organized, calling themselves “Jehovah's Youth’’, and although they have taken their stand on Jehovah’s side, like others of their age, they have natural desires and longings, but fhe chief purpose of their ra</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mtn</span><span class="font2">g together is for the study of God’s Word with the help </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font2">Society’s literature. They, however, are not only hearers </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the Word, but take a part in the witness work. In the past year 114 have served, working 2,223 hours, placing 124 books, 7,473 booklets and 5,700 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The drama &quot;Daniel” was presented by the group at Berne this last summer with an attendance of 600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Network of June 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We had great joy in making preparations for the greatest of all radio lectures to be given also in Europe. In all the radio journals and daily papers of all lands, with the exception of Germany, and in the European editions of English and American papers, notice was given of this lecture. Cards announcing it were sent to the diplomats and officials of tho League of Nations. Halls were secured in Berne, Geneva, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where the message was received by telephone. We received word from many that the lecture was well heard. Even in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, the message was heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are glad to report the production of the Berne factory as a unit in the organization which Jehovah is using to make known his holy name amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The people increasingly demand the message of Jehovah’s kingdom. During the past year the same amount of literature was produced as last year, and this in spite of such difficulties as in a big country like America are less likely to happen than on this continent. By the confusion of national boundaries, free trade amongst the nations is greatly handicapped, and this difficulty is now made worse by embargo laws and high-tariff walls. A magazine entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Technical Review</span><span class="font2"> gives a good picture of this when it writes: &quot;Disintegration and cutting off great districts of the world market, lessening of purchase power, overdrawn nationalism, heavy debt burdens, instability of currencies, unreasonable elevation of tariff walls to the extent of shutting off import entirely, these are the greatest difficulties in the way of increasing exports.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not these things serve one purpose: to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">der the dissemination of the message of the Kingdom and to curtail the distribution thereof? The enemy does not favor the more democratic countries, because in other lands it is easier to make emergency laws which are used to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">der the import of our literature. Then, if literature is printed in such countries, the enemy tries to control the output. Thus it became necessary to print Grennan, French, Croatian, Polish, Russian, Rumanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Hungarian and Ukrainian literature in Worldly printing plants in various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With fewer workers we were able to accomplish as much as last year. In 11 languages, to wit, German, Danish, Es-thonian, French, Finnish, Hollandish, Norwegian, Polish, Hungarian, Swedish, and Czech, we printed the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The director of the Central European office, M. C. Harbeek, is an American citizen. As the difficulties in Germany increased, and when Brother Balzereit was arrested and imprisoned, Brother Harbeek was sent to Germany to look after the Society’s property. He made no attempt to carry on the witness work there, because he was sent on a different mission. On arriving at Berlin, and when he began to check up on the property belonging to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and before he had barely got started on this work, he was arrested by the secret police and imprisoned, and the charges against him were ‘attempting to remove money out of the country and attempting to carry on the witness work and publishing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> in Switzerland in criticism of the German government’. On the first two charges there Was absolutely no evidence whatsoever and none could be obtained. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine, for which Brother Harbeek is not responsible, had published some facts against Germany. Brother Harheek was kept in prison for several days, and no one was permitted to communicate with him. Although efforts were made from the home office in America to get m communication with him, this could not be done. Then Brother Burton was sent from London to Magdeburg and, after considerable trouble with the police officers, he got in communication with the higher-ups of the German officials, who agreed to release Brother Har-beek from prison upon condition that he would leave the country. He had no alternative, as the German courts give no one who is a foreigner even the semblance of a just trial; and hence Brother Harbeek was required to withdraw from the country. He was released, and he returned to his post in Switzerland. For further facts concerning conditions in Germany, notice the subheading “Germany” hereinafter set forth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It appears to be the will of Jehovah that some testimony must be delivered in the country of China, although few hear the message. In the Chinese language there are now twelve of the Society’s publications distributed amongst the people. During the year pioneers have worked in ten different towns in China, and considerable interest has been shown. One radio station at Shanghai has been broadcasting the lectures by electrical transcription every Sunday during the year. The lecture delivered at Washington on June 2 was picked up by the radio station in China. Says the local director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the occasion two students called on me and asked if the Society would start a Bible class in their school, advising me that there are a number of Chinese who desire to join in the study of the Bible. I found that this college was not m harmony with professional missionaries. These Chinese can speak English very well and are familiar with the Bible text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year there have been in operation two transcription machines and three phonographs, regularly proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, and this has helped to interest others in the Lord’s will. The Catholics and Adventists do the best they can to prevent the proclamation of the message, but still it goes on. The exact number of books and booklets distributed in China during the year is: Bound books placed 1,010; booklets, 3,084; total, 4,094.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Czechoslovakia has made progress during the year. Some of the brethren who were formerly in Germany have been able to reside in Czechoslovakia and work there. Brother Balzereit was managing the work there until he was seized in Germany and imprisoned. The brethren, with brave hearts, have pushed on with the work. During the year they have increased the output of literature more than in previous years. Books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in the various languages in Czechoslovakia during the year total 543,385. The Society has some printing presses in that country and manufactures some of the literature there. From the report of the local director the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work in Czechoslovakia is carried through in eight languages, to wit: Bohemian, Slovak, German, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Rumanian and Polish. In the past year efforts were made to increase the work in the Bohemian-speaking parts of the country, because in these parts till now was proportionally the smallest number of companies, and it is our joy that we can report that about 25 new companies of interested were founded, and of these some have already shown their willingness to enter in the car of Jehu and to take an active part in the service of Jehovah. In the Slovak-speaking territory always were yet some 'Russellites'’, who had not a real enthusiasm for the present truth. But it can be seen that the-real faithful ones go on with zeal, although the ethers go away. In- the Russian part- a number of new companies were founded. and therefore greater attention must be given to the work among the Russians. These men generally are very primitive, yet they begin to see the hypocrisy of the clergy. In some parts of the Hungarian-speaking territory are many companies, so that we have there very little territory, and it can be witnessed very often. Now we began the publishing of the Hungarian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> and thereby these brethren will have new occasions of service. The German-speaking people in this country are very irritated by the events in Germany itself, and it must be said that many of them have already taken their position definitely against God’s kingdom, but, of course, there are yet many people of good will, who stand in sympathy with the message of the truth. Of course, the carrying on of the work in the different languages makes it somewhat difficult, but the Lord always gives his people all that is necessary for his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two years ago 75 percent of all pioneers active in Czechoslovakia were foreign citizens, but now only six pioneers are active who are foreign citizens; all others are citizens of this country. By the new immigration laws it would now be impossible for a greater number of foreigners to continue the work, but the Lord directed things that now thereby there is no handicap for the work. The average number of pioneers this year was 88. The highest number we had in December, with 100; the lowest, in August, with 67. The reason is that in the summer some pioneers take up some worldly employment, because financial conditions are very bad. Yet always the greatest part of the work is done by the pioneers. The number of pieces of literature distributed by the pioneers was 320,811. In some territories the pioneers were very much persecuted by the clergy and their crowd. But they joyfully took their burdens, and they continue in the service for Jehovah and for Gideon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies and Sharpshooters</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is remarkable to see that the number of company workers and sharpshooters has further increased. It is also joyful to see that the part which the company workers had in the distribution of literature has increased. In the foregoing fiscal year this part was about 25 percent; in this year now it was 36 percent. This shows also that the truth has gained further footing. The average number of company workers in the last</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">year was 600; the highest was 898. In this year now the average number was 708; the highest number was 965. The truth is on the march, and Jehovah’s witnesses rejoice that they can have a part in this glorious service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Factory and Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With deep thankfulness to Jehovah God we have the joy to report that m this fiscal year, in the capital town of this country, at Prague, with the approval of the president of the Society a printery was installed, and that it is now possible to manufacture the booklets and magazines, needed in Czechoslovakia, at Prague. We print literature in Bohemian, Hungarian and the Slovak language. The first booklet manufactured at Prague was the Bohemian booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World? </span><span class="font2">which was distributed during Tha</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font2">giving Period. It seems to be a sign of the approval of the Lord, that even in the Thanksgiving Period all records were broken, and that a witness was given as it was never before. All together, there were manufactured in the Prague printery in the course of about half a year 150,000 booklets, 15,000 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font2">10,000 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> and a great number of handbills, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> etc. We thank Jehovah God that he has better equipped his people in this country, and we are convinced that the printery will work further to the glorification of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Creation Drama</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The &quot;Creation” Drama, which contains for the most part extracts from the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font2"> supported by pictures and films, has shown itself as a good means for the proclamation of the truth in this country. In this year a great campaign was carried on with the &quot;Creation” Drama, and it can be said that it was a tremendous witness for Jehovah’s name; 81 towns were visited, with a total attendance of 66,718, and 1,888 books and 9,583 booklets were placed in the hands of the people; 6,285 men of good will gave their addresses, desiring to hear more about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One time in the Tno</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nH-n</span><span class="font2">g, when the drama should be given, the clergy arranged a demonstration of their crowd before the magistrate with the effect that the drama was forbidden 'because of endangering public security’. Really the clergy had endangered the security. A second time, shortly after the beginning, this crowd was bawling and making noise under the guidance of their clergyman, who took the lead, that the present policeman dissolved the meeting. The public press gave these events a wide publication, and the whole town was witnessed to with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font2"> and very many booklets were distributed, thus showing the hypocrisy of these 'men of black cloth’. By these events indeed the attention of the whole pub-hc was drawn to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the anger of the enemy was working for Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription and Phonograph Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the first time in this year we can report re the work with the records. And at the end of the fiscal year we must say that Jehovah has blessed his people very much also in this part of the work. A number of brethren at first showed a certain prejudice against the work with the records; but when Jehovah gives his people the order to do a thing, the true and faithful ones will go on with enthusiasm, and they will overcome With Jehovah’s help all difficulties which are laid in the way. The attendance at the transcription meetings has continually increased. The total attendance during the fiscal year was 95,818. Herewith we give a survey of the work done with the transcription machines and phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trans, meetings Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,050 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53,828</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Auxiliaries &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company workers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41,642</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,168 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95,818</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren had wonderful experiences in this work, and it can be seen that by this work a real dividing of the people Will be apparent. In many places brethren were received very friendly, and it happened that the mayor of a place invited the brethren to place their loud-speaker on the balcony of the town hall. In some places brethren got rooms in the hotels without any contribution, but at other places the clergy brought a crowd and sometimes it was only Jehovah's power that kept the transcription machines from being wrecked. Once some brethren were besieged by an incited crowd until twelve o ’clock at night. But always there were men of good will, who supported the brethren, and Jehovah's protection was always with them. The transcription work was carried on in the Bohemian, German, Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Bussian and Pohsh languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, this work has challenged the enemy, and the clergy have begun a great campaign against the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, but this fact has even more stirred up the zeal of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In August the first loud-speaker—car began its work in Czechoslovakia, and this, of course, is by far the best means that we have. Already in one month the brethren who serve with the car report that they had 21,000 hearers. We hope that there can be a further increase in this work in the next fiscal year. Now we make preparations for the great transcription witness on September 29 with the great message '' Government ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The opposition against the truth and the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses are different according to the districts and the influence which the Catholic Hierarchy has in these distucts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the beginning of the fiscal year 200 actions were pending; in the course of the year 115 were finished (of these, in 112 cases the defendants were dismissed; in 3 eases, sentenced), 98 new ones were begun, and at the end of this fiscal year there are 183 actions pending. That means 17 less than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now preparations are made to send the grand message “Government” to all parts of the country, and beg</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font2">ng with the World-wide Praise Period this message will be proclaimed in this whole country, and it will sound like Gideon’s battle-cry “Por Jehovah and his Vindicator”. The facts and the Scriptures show that Armageddon is near, and this knowledge is stirring up all faithful ones and all Jonadabs to be really m the first hne of the battle, and we ask the Lord to bless us further, that next year we may give even a better report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention at Uzhorod</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On September 8 a convention at Uzhorod, Carpathorussia, of Slovak, Hungarian and Russian-speaking brethren, adopted the following resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“350 witnesses of Jehovah and Jonadabs of Slovak, Hungarian and Russian language at Uzhorod assembled manifest their absolute faithfulness and devotion to Jehovah and his kingdom and their willingness to stand under all circumstances on the side of Jehovah and his King, taking active part in. his work. They express their joy and appreciation of the truths which the Lord has revealed to his people, and of the privilege of working together in his glorious work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the morning of this convention nineteen brethren, going from house to house, were arrested and held in prison four days. They were accused for ‘shocking the religious sensibilities'. But the Lord protected and released them, and at the trial they were all dismissed. The public press gave these events a wide publication, and by this the name of Jehovah God was glorified.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In the country of Danzig there is a constant agitation by the Nazis from Germany. These, under the direction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, resort to all manner of misrepresentation to involve Jehovah’s witnesses in difficulties and prevent them from testifying to the truth. From the local director’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Realizing that the National Socialistic influence was reaching out over the borders into the Free City, the brethren in Danzig put forth special effort to give a thorough witness, with the result that in the first half-year about as much was done as in the whole year previously. In the begi</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font2">g of April a vote of the people was taken to express their attitude toward National Socialism. This resulted in a </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">-min</span><span class="font2">ority for the Nazis who, disappointed, began their nasty work. Action was taken against the Communists, many of whom were arrested, and the false accusation was made and announced over radio that the Bible Students’ organization was used to carry on the forbidden activity of the Communists. A Mr. Wegener, sculptor and a Communist, was said to be the leader of the Bible Students. He, and 19 accomplices, who were also said to be members of the Bible Students ’ movement, were arrested. The whole matter was a falsity as far as we are concerned. The “Danziger Volksstimme” (The Danzig </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Voice of the People),</span><span class="font2"> No. 89, made the following statement: “ . . . The evidence of the Court Director, Dr. Grosskopf, was much to the point. First of all it is to be said that in the court proceedings not the slightest evidence was brought forth that the forbidden Communist party was carried on through the Bible Students’ organization and that not one of the accused Co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmunis</span><span class="font2">ts was a member of the Bible Students' movement, not even Mr. Wegener. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other papers thereafter brought a truthful statement of facts. Thus the structure of lies and false accusations which had gone out to the world fell to pieces, but the injustice done to innocent people through the far-reaching influence of the Danzig press and the radio has not been expiated. In spite of their being proved innocent, the work of the brethren was forbidden, and the property of the Society, literature, furniture, etc., was seized and the director of the Danzig office sent from the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were a number of cases where brethren were ill-treated in Danzig, but for a good reason we omit giving the details here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results of the work in this small section, in spite of these disorders, are to be much appreciated:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The report from. Denmark this year is pleasing, because it marks an increase in the Kingdom interests. The brethren in that land have been very zealous, and the Lord has blessed their efforts. From the local director’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our quota for the year was 300 out each week, 110,000 hours, 22,000 books and 300,000 booklets. We managed 295 out regularly, 23,412 books and 355,863 booklets, a record total of 379,275, and an increase of 4,104 books and 29,814 booklets over last year’s record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The message sent to the Hitler government at the end of last October's Kingdom Praise Period gave the brethren everywhere to feel that gieat events were toward and conduced to greater unity and efficiency in the presentation of our message. This was further emphasized by your speech broadcast worldwide from Washington on June 2. It was heard in Copenhagen by an audience of 300 persons, and the reception was excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally the news of your discourse to the brethren at Washington on the “great multitude” thrilled us and gave a great impetus to the work already pointedly drawn, to our attention in the &quot;cities of refuge” articles last year. The results of that work were apparent at Copenhagen service convention in August, when an average of 600 was in attendance and the highest was 715. At that time 94 symbolized their consecration io do the will of Jehovah. There we were seeing the fulfillment of the prophecies of which you had given the explanation at Washington. At that convention 433 friends were out in the field, and spread 7,086, while we all rejoiced in the goodness of our God. Apart from that convention 14 others were arranged up and down the country, with an average attendance of 90. At each the brethren were out in the field and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> articles were considered to the end that we might be helped the more effectively to pei form our covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;Great Multitude”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year we have Bought more and more to come into touch with the members of this class. To that end 109 public meetings have been held, with an average attendance of 116. To these were invited all the interested ones whose names appear in the card indexes of the service directors, whether found through spreading the books or in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> work. Follow-up meetings were then held for all who were interested, and, in aD, 108 of such Jonadab meetings were held, at which an average of 25 was present. For the first time too, in September, we have been able to hold three open-air meetings with the aid of an electrical transcription machine and records we have made ourselves. The attendances averaged 102, and 11 books and 60 booklets were spread there. We hope that next year this part of the work will be much expanded. It promises to be as effective here as elsewhere. Certainly the clearer light we are constantly receiving gives greater point to all our witnessing work at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By reason of the new friends coming along the circulation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> has increased by 179, to 1,727 (for Denmark and Norway). It continually brings refreshment and encouragement as well as giving us a clearer vision and more courage for the fight. The &quot;Great Multitude” articles appear this month in Danish, and all are eagerly looking forward to the studies thereon. It is indeed strengthening to our faith to see the beg</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">innin</span><span class="font2">g of the fulfillment of Bevelation 7: 10. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> magazine, with an average circulation of 11,000, apart from single copies, continues to act as a powerful auxiliary of the field service work. Frequently subscribers write in for the literature mentioned in it, and in one campaign a small company spread 81 bound books to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">G A.</span><span class="font2"> readers who weic interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Economic conditions are probably better in Scandinavia than anywhere else on earth, but m “De</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nm</span><span class="font2">ark the restrictions imposed by the working of the Valuta Commission are severely bumpering trade and working hardship to many people. To ■enable Denmark to compete in the English market it is needful to artificially depreciate the value of the krone, and this is done by allowing no imports without permits from the Commission. Realizing the altruistic nature of our work they have allowed us to import books pretty freely, especially as it was not needful to pay for them. Since eaily this year, however, they have given us no more permits. In the result we have bad to print </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Umvei sal War Near</span><span class="font2"> locally, as well as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government. </span><span class="font2">Some of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> we shall be able to import, and then further supplies of bound books must also be printed here, too, unless it could be done m England. However, we have good supplies of bound books at the moment, thanks to your foresight. Apart fiom these restrictions Denmark is a democratic, liberty-loving land, and we are glad of the freedom that is ouis in proclaiming the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Faroe Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some years ago a brother who went up here was expelled. They refused to allow the spread of our message. This summer two sisters went up and spent a holiday there at their own expense. Thev were forbidden to work as before, but, claiming that the Supreme Court case, which we won a couple of years ago, was operative also in the Faroe isles, they went on with the job and spread 833 books and 1,767 booklets, to our great joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Estonia, amidst great difficulties and much persecution, the workers have accomplished more than in ■the previous year. The total distribution of books and booklets in the hands of the people in that country during the year was 67,754. In addition thereto, however, there have been a large number of tracts and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazines distributed. The local director reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The increasing desire on the part of the common people to hear the message of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom is further demonstrated by the fact that 2,605 more persons attended the 31 public meetings held throughout the year than were present at a greater number of s</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">imila</span><span class="font2">r gatherings the previous year. Two regional service directors were engaged in arranging and addressing these public assemblies. Never before had any such meetings been held in the territory covered, but pioneers had gone over it with literature. The meetings everywhere were well attended ■and caused considerable interest in all directions, and among all classes of people. In order to hear the message many people walked several </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font2">es in the dark. At the close of each meeting literature was distributed and Bible questions were answered. The two brothers have had many evidences of the Lord’s care and guidance. As they traveled from place to place, covering, in all, 1,715 miles, they were obliged to bear occasional sickness caused by improper food and aluminum poisoning, and to suffer the inconveniences co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font2">on to very poor rural districts. The results, however, are worth all the trials; for several of those who attended the meetings have become active workers. During his vacation, one brother who has recently become interested spread over a thousand books and booklets in virgin territory. He has purchased a few of the five-minute-talk phonograph records and does some witnessing with them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The total number of pioneers in the work during the year was seventeen, and the average number in the field month by month was eleven. Hive of these regular pioneers are foreigners, and therefore required to obtain permission to engage in any kind of work. Their permits to work expired about three months ago, and although applications for renewals were promptly made the permits have not been granted. The reduction in the number of whole-time publishers of the gospel has greatly affected the extent and effectiveness of the witness given in this little country. Some Estonian pioneers, together with the company workers, are, of course, doing all they can. There is a rich field here, and we pray that the other publishers may be restored to activity therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dor several years a translation of the leading article of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> has been made. This Esto</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nia</span><span class="font2">n translation was multiplied by means of a small portable hand apparatus; foi ty to sixty copies were made. Because this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> was intended for brethren and friends only, and not for indiscriminate distribution, no application to have it registered was made. Last September, however, certain regulations governing the publishing of all kinds of printed and duplicated matters were issued by the government and it was deemed advisable to seek registration, of the journal. A request to have the journal registered was lodged with the authorities, but it was refused and indications were given by the authorities that they had the Society and its activities under observation. Efforts were made to clear away the misunderstandings and prejudice of the authorities concerned and to get the magazine registered. Some success in this direction was attained, but owing to unforeseen difficulties the fortnightly tract has not yet been registered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A consignment of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Euler</span><span class="font2"> was received last September. Distribution of it was at once begun and continued until February 4, when, by order of the minister of the Interior, the booklet was confiscated. Exception was taken to this publication because, it was claimed, “it contains objectionable expressions and expressions of ridicule concerning the League of Nations, which may be detrimental to the interests of the foreign politics of the Estonian Republic. ’ ’ On 17th July the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Eule the World?</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> were hkewise confiscated. The additional reasons given for this action were, “that the booklets speak in the manner of a demagogue about the activity of governmental leaders, church leaders, authorities and courts, which may provoke e</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nmi</span><span class="font2">ty of the people against the said leaders, and that they prophesy the coming of a terrible universal war in the near future, which no power will be able to resist, that may cause disturbance among the less educated classes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The peoples’ greatest enemy was behind this move to hide the truth, but he did not completely succeed. Probably without realizing what they were doing, the two leading dailies, with a combined circulation of about 100,000, published the information that the Society’s booklets contain the prediction that universal war is near, which no power is able to avert. This important truth was therefore widely broadcast to a greater number of persons than would have received a copy of the booklet in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few days after this occurred the local Estonian society, that was registered about two years ago, was dissolved by order of the minister of the Interior. The indictment issued by the authorities cla</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ims</span><span class="font2">, among other t</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">gs, that the said society “has been developing political propaganda detrimental to the Estonian Republic and that it has by reason thereof deviated from its registered statutes”. On the basis of the indictment powers were conferred on the police to arrest the property of the association. The society in question never at any time possessed any property or stock of literature, and because of ■some irregularity or obscure reason, the police n&lt;rt only have closed the Society’s branch office by sealing the door, but have put under arrest circa 76,000 pieces of literature and have placed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> lien on furniture and other household effects, all of which are the property of the Watch Tower Bibize &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Brooklyn. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> has beai confiscated, and about a week ago the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> and several booklets were also confiscated. Every effort is being made to overcome all the afore-mentioned hindrances, and formidable as they are, they are not too great for the Lord to remove.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A review of the woik done in this country during the past twelve months gives cause for gratitude and joy. There has been greater interest shown by the people for the Kingdom; there has been greater opposition from the enemy and his visible agents, and there has been and is a greater devotion, determination and j’oy among those who advertise the King and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom. All of these factors bear eloquent testimony to the fact that in Estonia the command to preach the gospel of the Kingdom has been and is now being earned out. They show that the Lord's approval is upon his faithful people here and that he is blessing their efforts to serve and honor him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font3">Finland makes a good report for the year. The publishers have been earnest and zealous, as the results clearly indicate. The total number of books and booklets distributed, as shown by the report, is 333,331. This is an increase over the previous year. The following quotation is from the report of the local director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publishers have more and more realized their privileges, and an increasing number of Jonadabs have joined the work, and although the number of them that have taken part m the ^Memorial has gone a good lot down, yet we have Been a nice increase of the workers. The number of permit-holders has been 702. The highest number of company workers including the Jonadabs has been 638, and they have placed 11,495 books, 228,682 booklets, 13,358 subscriptions, and 39,558 papers, or, together, 293,093 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers’ work in our country, with small cities and long ways between the houses, is heavy and difficult, yet our dear pioneers show great zeal and patience carrying the message even to the most far-away -corners of our country. The number of the pioneers an3 auxiliaries has been 64, and they have spread 93,154 books and 27,551 papers, or, together, 120,705.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Begional service directors are doing in our country a very important work. As the bulk of our classes are- very small and weak, they need a good lot of help and encouragement. Bor that reason our regional service directors have to do a manifold work when they visit classes. They make a full investigation of the conditions m the class, exa</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font2">ng the accounts of the class and the bookstore and how the books are kept. Then they with, words and example are helping the friends to take part in the service work. Many times it happens also that the friends in a small class have not had enough time to take part in a general push, and for that reason the books which have been sent to them have been lying. Then the regional service director takes as many as possible of such books to some other place after he has first tried with the friends to spread what has been possible. The regional service directors are indeed doing a big and important work, and they send always a report to the office of all that they have observed and done during their visits. Begional service directors are generally doing not only a very important work in the classes, but often they have spread books as much as our best pioneers, and sometimes even more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">International testimony periods have, as even earlier, been times of great blessings. Last spring we received such a number of publishers, which we had not earlier been able to dream of. The biggest number of publishers has been 722, and the whole amount of literature during the periods was 159,872, which, compared with the work done last year, 117,907, means an increase of 41,965, or 35.5 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Washington convention. It was very wonderful that even we here in Finland had the great privilege and pleasure to bo present at that great event. We could very weH hear not only the interesting lecture ' ‘ Government ’</span><span class="font2"><sup>r</sup>, but also the applauses and the mighty &quot;Aye” in the end of the lecture, in which we joined with our whole heart. It was indeed very encouraging to hear the lecture and realize the unity of all the remnant in the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conventions in our country are special times of refreshing and encouragement for the friends to take part in the service work. Especially encouraging was our main convention in Helsinki. The biggest attendance was 545; 279 took part in the work, and 6,268 pieces of literature were spread. We have had, together, 55 conventions, with an attendance of 2,514, and the whole amount of literature spiead has been 32,110. At the conventions 75 have symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public lectures have been an instrument to fix the attention of the public on the message. Especially encouraging was the big meeting held in Helsinki last spring. Our biggest halls have been so far constructed for about only 1,000 people, but now we have got a hall which can take about 7,000. To our great joy we succeeded to get that hall, which quickly was overcrowded with an estimated attendance of 7,500, while thousands could not come in. The interest was very great, and in the end our little company of 240 publishers in a few minutes spread over 6,000 books. The whole number of lectures has been 115, with an attendance of 21,991, at which 8,079 pieces of literature have been placed in hands of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Office staff has also this year with zeal and energy fulfilled their duties not only at the office, but also in the field service, and to our great joy, we have been able to spread 19,174 copies of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our printing plant has well helped the work and given us 665,445 pieces of printed matter.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The publishing work of the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ Jesus has been done under considerable handicap in France during the fiscal year. The French people have never manifested a great amount of interest in the Kingdom. The Polish people who migrated there after the war and English brethren who have gone into France and done work have accomplished more in the publication of the Kingdom than the natives of France. There are, however, some really zealous French brethren, and these all work together with the others. Many of the Poles have been expelled during the year, likewise British brethren, and this has hindered the work. From the report of the local director of service the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although we have 42,448 publications less to report than, in 1934, the following statistics show that Jehovah’s witnesses, comparatively speaking, have put in more hours in 1935 and distributed more literature than during the previous year. The decline is merely on account of the departure of many Polish brethren, and accordingly we have fewer workers. Here is a comparison:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There were 361 fewer brethren and 114 fewer workers. Out of the 361 brethren, about 280 were Poles, who returned to their home country. The remainder are those who became discouraged through the difficulties encountered. It is, however, very gratifying to see that of those who remain nearly all are workers. This refers more to our Polish cowitnesses than to the French. Here a proof:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">During the year under consideration there were over 900 more books distributed than in the previous year, but there is a decline in the placements of booklets and periodicals, especially as regards the Polish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> which is accounted for in the return of many Poles to their home country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That our Polish brethren appear even more zealous than the French is very gratifying, because in spite of the ever present danger of expulsion they do not refrain from working, but obeying the year’s text they shout, &quot;For Jehovah and for Gideon. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It is pitiable that in this great land there can be little done by the pioneers at the present time, but the work accomplished by these from 1930 to 1934 was a sowing which has borne fruit. From all parts of France letters are continually received —expressions of joy that Jehovah’s witnesses have visited them and that they have learned something of the truth. A service director is making his first trip through France organizing the Jonadab work, so there are good prospects that the work formerly carried on by the pioneers will be continued by the Jonadabs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much literature has been placed by the pioneers among the people of northern Africa. The section from Tunis to Morocco is under French rule. We are sorry to say, however, that recently the last of the pioneers working there, Enghsh brethren, have been sent out of the country. The radio had much to do with the success of the work there. Lectures from French stations were well heard in northern Africa. Many letters testify to this fact. For instance, a young man belonging to the French Sahara regiment writes to his mother in northern France: &quot;I know, mother, that you now have a radio and hear the lectures as I do. Here I am able to hear without disturbance; at home I never heard so well. Please continue to send me </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">General observations and experience show that people who, two years ago, were indifferent to the truth, are now responding and taking pains to examine the literature. Also the past year has shown again that the radio is the best means of reaching all classes. Thousands of letters from all classes of people and from ten different countries prove how necessary it is to continue in this way, even at the cost of considerable sacrifice. During the past year we were able to give 335 radio lectures over three stations. According to letters received the message was heard in ten different countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have also again participated in Exhibitions and were granted two more awards for our publications, among which a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Hots Concents.</span><span class="font2"> In this and in other countries these diplomas have been a great help to us with the authorities. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is more widely known than we beheve, and although the clergy endeavor to slander us, the truth triumphs more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Quite a number of Jonadab friends have stated their willingness to co-operate as publishers, and we have now begun to organize them as companies for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have only one electrical transcription machine, with which 23 lectures were given, with an attendance of 10,000. However, we have about 100 phonographs, and with these 522 lectures were given in homes, whereby about 1,350 people received the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Letters received, 8,974 (2,000 more than in 1934); and 6,813 letters and cards were dispatched. The increase in letters received is evidence of the interest shown by the people; who daily write us asking many questions regarding the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two special campaigns with the French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> were Carried out, whereby 23,888 copies of this periodical were distributed. These campaigns also resulted in obtaining 707 new regular readers and 245 subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were only two regional service conventions held. The friends attending received a great blessing, and on these occasions 147 Jonadabs testified through baptism their devotion to Jehovah and his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the early days of Rome, when true Christians were being hanged or otherwise slaughtered because of their devotion to God and Christ Jesus, and when true followers of Jesus were forbidden to meet together to worship God, the real ones devoted to God and Christ, in spite of such wicked persecution, did meet together and study the Word of the Lord. Likewise today in some portions of the earth, where honest men are forbidden to worship God and Christ Jesus as commanded by Jehovah and who are cruelly persecuted because they do so, in spite of such cruel persecution some of the courageous ones have gone quietly about and told others about the blessings that are coming through God’s kingdom, which is at hand. During the first six months of the fiscal year these true and faithful ones in this manner placed in the hands of the people 284,662 books and booklets. During the latter half of the fiscal year no information has been received from them as to how they get on. God will not forget these faithful ones. He is always mindful of those who serve him. We may be sure that he will encourage and strengthen them in every way that is deemed necessary for them to maintain their integrity toward him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Greece the work has not progressed, so far as the distribution of the literature is concerned, during the fiscal year. This has been due to the repeated interference by the so-called “Orthodox Church”, the Greek Catholic, which is another wing of the Devil’s organization. The distribution of books and booklets totals 117,219. The clergy are constantly interfering, to prevent the message of God’s kingdom from being proclaimed. From the report of the local director the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clergy try now to take advantage of the revision of the Constitution, in order to insert an amendment to the effect that &quot;proselytism is absolutely forbidden, as well as every intervention against the Orthodox Church&quot;. The justification of this measure, among others, is to suppress the spreading of our literature, as it is stated in the statement submitted to the committee for revision of the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Notwithstanding this the witnesses of Jehovah, being fully aware of their responsibility and privilege, are decided to go on with the work of the Lord, giving boldly the testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also are thankful to the Lord for the increasing light which he gives us through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> in these days, which we appreciate most heartily. As we see the time nearing for the vindication of his holy name our hearts swell in song and our earnest prayer is to destroy the enemy and all his organization, that all creation may Bee that He is the only Almighty God, and that his Christ is the great King, and so His name may take the proper place in the minds and hearts of all his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Albania the Greek language is used chiefly and the work is carried on in connection with the Athens office. In Albania during the year there have been distributed books and booklets to the number of 6,688. Including this in the Greek report, therefore, makes total literature distributed 123,907.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>HAWAIIAN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s branch office established in Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, is making progress. Only a small number of workers are there, the publishers numbering 12 in all. During the year property was purchased and a suitable hall and living quarters were erected. This building fronts on a boulevard and also abuts on a side street. Signs are placed on the building, advertising the hall and the books. These are illuminated by electricity, so that everyone passing must see the signs. The work has progressed there during the year, and the total number of books and booklets placed is, to wit, 19,170. From the local director’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The real high point of the year’s witness, Brother Rutherford, was the public address delivered by you here in Honolulu at McKinley auditorium last April, and which was earned by radio to the other islands. At that meeting 591 pieces of literature were placed with the audience. Since then many placements of literature have been made in house-to-house witnessing because the one called on attended the meeting at Mc</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kinl</span><span class="font2">ay auditorium. And, too, your visit was of the greatest inspiration and encouragement to Jehovah’s witnesses here in their work. Added to this are the great provisions made by Jehovah through you while here, for extending the witness in these islands. First, the sending of a fully equipped sound car with which to carry Jehovah’s message to the people. This has proved a very great blessing, affording many privileges of service. As shown on the report, many meetings have been held, and over 17,000 persons have heard the name of Jehovah honored by means of the sound equipment. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">TmTn</span><span class="font2">e.dia.te1y at the close of each lecture calls are made from house to house over the neighborhood with the message in printed form. In the few months since the arrival of the sound car, 2,390 pieces of literature have been placed by means of it, several hundred of this total being bound books. In Jehovah’s providence it arrived in time for use on June 2, for the world-wide broadcast. And Jehovah’s blessing has been very manifestly upon its use ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And then came to us </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom Hall, for use in honoring his name at transcription lectures and study meetings, also as a headquarters for Jehovah’s literature and publishers at this place. In addition to the meetings held in it, Kingdom Hall, with its signs and books on display, brings the name and word of Jehovah pro</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font2">ently before the people. At each meeting, and, in fact, daily, ail here give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness in making such wonderful piovision. The Lord has done so much for his work that the publishers here feel an additional weight of responsibility to faithfully carry out the work the Lord has given them. Meetings in Kingdom Hall are held in English, Spanish and Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the construction of Kingdom Hall many things occurred which demonstrated clearly the providences of Jehovah. It has been the means of greater co-operation amongst Jehovah’s witnesses at this place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another effect of your visit was the stirring up of the enemy, so that, among other things, they coerced radio station KGMB into quitting the broadcast of your transcription lectures. But since the sound car was already on the job, it is believed that a greater number of people have been reached by this means than previously with the local radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tebritoby: During the year the city of Honolulu has been gone over several times with the Kingdom message, and the remainder of the island of Oahu once. The residents of the island of Maui were thoroughly witnessed to, and a large portion of the island of Hawaii covered by pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chain broadcasts: During the past year these islands participated for the first time in hearing your chain broadcasts from the mainland. In November 1934 your address from Atlanta reached here by shortwave. Again, on January 13, the message of the Kingdom was heard by shortwave and rebroadcast by local station KGMB. On June 2 came the climax, with the world-wide broadcast from Washington, D. C. The shortwave reception was remarkably clear, and it was rebroadcast from the local station, also from the sound car with very good results. It was thrilling to be out here in the middle of the ocean and hear Jehovah’s message going out so extensively over the earth. It is a cause for rejoicing that on this important occasion Jehovah permitted his message to reach the people in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At one of the recent meetings held with the sound car outside a church great interest was shown. After the lecture 3 books and 84 booklets were placed with the listeners. On one occasion when an officer was sent to stop the sound car the purpose of the work was outlined to him. After liste</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g to the conclusion of the &quot;Government” broadcast and enjoying it, he said: &quot;Don’t you feel insulted or discouraged by what I said.

<p><span class="font3">The zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house has been shown in Holland during the past year. The activities have increased, and the results have increased. Jonadabs have joined the remnant, and the work has progressed. The orders sent in from the people individually to the Society’s office for literature show an increased interest of the people of Holland. Like other parts of the earth, the great multitude is beginning to show itself. This is an encouragement to the remnant and a joy to their hearts. The local director of service in his report says, among other things, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While last year we reported 12 companies only, we are able to start the new year with 21 larger and smaller companies. Some of these have been formed only in recent months, so that there is as yet little to be shown of their activity in the annual</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">These figures are surely gratifying when we consider that there were five company workers less in the field and that, in spite of this, 702 more hours were spent in the service and 2,185 more publications distributed. The Jonadab work, we believe, will help us during the coming year to considerably increase the number of publishers and hours and the output of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The economic situation in Holland is daily growing worse, and the number of unemployed constantly on the increase, and even the little material help the latter get, the Government is forced to reduce from time to time. This, Of course, makes it more and more difficult for the people to obtain literature. Therefore we are glad to see that during the past year the company workers as well as the pioneers distributed more books than ever before. With the increasing distress many are more and more hungering and thirsting after truth and righteousness. On the other hand, we need hardly say that the publishers need all their energy to obtain such results and that they gladly put forth their best efforts in the service of our great King. Unselfishness and full devotion are put to a steadily increasing test.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the six Service Periods there were 98 company workers in the field. They worked 1,035 hours and distributed to 3,298 obtainers: 28 books, 4,246 booklets and 84 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font2">copies. During one service period there was more accomplished than in either of the two preceding campaigns in November and February. As can be expected, our joy was great. Never before was such a result reached by the company workers in one Special period. However, we shall do our best to repeat that result in the coming Praise Period, which will inaugurate the new fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the six special campaigns of the past year we had an average of 76 company workers in the field, who in 4,182 hours handed 174 books, 12,278 booklets and 2,971 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies to 10,373 obtainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Electrical Transcription Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With this new means, the electrical transcription machines, the Lord has opened up wonderful opportunities of service. As in Holland there is no possibility of using the radio to reach the people, we immediately made a good start with the electrical transcription work. In January we had the first transcription records manufactured in Berne. Meanwhile the companies were invited to order a phonograph or an electrical transcription machine. Shortly thereafter we received orders for 25 phonographs and 1 transcription machine (made in Brooklyn), and all these were shipped. There is much interest shown for the lectures. Much prejudice has been removed thereby, and after the people have heard a few discourses, they are more willing to obtain the literature. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font2"> together we have now the complete series A, B, C and D (30-cm. records). These lectures are being circulated from company to company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Apart from this, towards the end of the fiscal year, we recorded also the first 18 five-minute lectures on 25-em. discs. These records will shortly arrive in Holland, and we hope that they can be put to very good use during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As mentioned, the electrical transcription work has but been organized during recent months, but we are, unfortunately, not able to give an accurate report thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having seen the sound cars in London at the end of the previous fiscal year, we immediately set about to manufacture such a car for the work in Holland. Jehovah has at his service all kinds of workers capable of doing what is required. Thus we have a brother here, a pioneer, who formerly was a bodymaker. This sound car is the first one in use on the European continent. It provides sleeping accommodation for two persons. The two beds may be slung up to the walls. The loud-speaker, of great capacity, can be raised above the roof for use; otherwise it is Bunk in the roof, so that it is not recognized as a sound car. This feature enables ns to surprise the enemy. This ear is also provided with a water-tap fed from a tank in the roof, as well as with a folding table and two camp stools. The top of the back part of the ear can be removed and replaced by a canvas on which we can project the Photo-Drama pictures from the driver’s seat. One brother does the projecting while the other, standing behind the car, explains them. This brother stands in a circle limited by a cord, which circle may be increased or decreased according to the size of the audience. He keeps his bookease close at hand, so that, immediately after the lecture, he can serve the literature to the public. There is much interest in Holland for such lectures, and we are sure that the work done with this car will meet with great success. It has been in operation but a few months, and we have already obtained encouraging results. In two months we worked 89 hours with it, and gave 171 lectures, to a total attendance of 4,023 people. Thereby we distributed 85 books, 1,419 booklets and 186 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> copies. It is a real joy to go out with this car and to be able to proclaim the message of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom in such a clear and distinct way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Interesting Experiences from the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One sister working in a little place called at a lady’s home. As the bell rang and she saw a woman standing at the door, she said to her daughter: &quot;It is surely again about money for the crisis committee or something else. Wouldn’t it be much better if one came around with Rutherford’s books J That would, be of greater benefit to us. ’ ’ When the lady heard that this sister really came with Judge Rutherford's books, she welcomed her heartily. This family had made a careful study of our literature, and gladly obtained the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> and three booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A Polish brother worked in a Catholic town. After a while he was accosted by a policeman and was asked what he was doing. The brother explained his missionary activity, but the policeman considered it peddling and asked him to come to the police office. When no attention was paid there to his denunciation, the brother was conducted to the chief of police. There the two were introduced to the chief of police and to a number of higher police officers who just happened to be there. The official charged the brother with peddling before the chief of police, who, after having examined the literature, said that this was a philanthropic gospel-work, which could be done freely. A police inspector happening to be there told the chief of police that a year before he had bought </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> and had found it a very nice book. He said that if all the books were as nice as that one, there should be distributed as many as possible in the place. When the policeman saw that he was not heard, he pulled from the brother’s pocket the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font2"> and asked the police chief what the cover meant. He answered: ‘' This policeman here on the picture, that’s you, who at the bidding of the clergy bring this innocent man before me that I should condemn </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him.</span><span class="font2"> But I shall not do so, for he is guiltless. ’ ’ The brother was then dismissed with the assurance that he would have no further trouble in that town.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Hungary the Society’s office and the workers pushed the work as best possible under the handicap. There is great opposition and much difficulty in doing the witness work. In the face of this the brethren continue, by the Lord’s grace, to proclaim the message of Jehovah and his King. The distribution of literature during the year increased, the total number of books and booklets placed being 126,550. From the local director’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A great hindrance to the work 13 the fact that only such books and booklets can he distributed as are printed in Hungary itself, and that each import of Watch Tower literature is forbidden. So tall now, because of the high costs -of printing, we had only two books, but now the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> is in course of preparation, and it is hoped that thereby also the number of books distributed will be higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The capital town Budapest nearly fully is witnessed by pioneers who came in from Germany. Yet the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font2">culty is that they can stay there &quot;a time of only three to six months and must then leave the country for a time, and can then again stay there three to six months. So pioneers must be changed often. But the Eord gave his protection for these brethren and they were able to give a good witness at Budapest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But we are very glad to say that now there are more pioneers from the country itself who give their whole time to the field service. Especially in the last weeks there was a good increase of these brethren, there being twenty Hungarian citizens who are now engaged in full-time service in Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There was an increase in the field service done by the company workers. The literature distributed by company workers increased from 37,963 to 70,524, which is an increase of 90 percent. As in all countries, the remnant and the Jonadabs understand better their privileges and go on with greater zeal for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Opposition in Hungary is very strong. The whole country is ruled by the Cathobe church. The most difficult thing is that all meetings are forbidden. Only at two places the friends have permission to come together. Everywhere else it is forbidden (officially), and there is a large district with a great number of friends where this interdiction is ruthlessly enforced. Not even two friends may meet there undisturbed. It is only a few days ago that in this district a small company once again dared to have a very private meeting, and the police interfered, whereupon a number of these friends were cruelly beaten by the poheemen. Such beating is the custom on every such occasion. After they are treated in this manner, the official con-demuation follows, too: fine or imprisonment. Some of the friends were punished five times m the course of this year. There are more liberal and tolerant authorities, however. The more the Boman Catholic influence dominates, the worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under these conditions, of course, it is quite difficult to do things orderly and in an organized way. Legally speaking, there are very </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font2">ted possibilities to do the witness work. The enemy organization has prepared for itself a strong defense. But Jehovah’s anointed know which are the “Higher Powers’’, and they know that Jehovah gave not only permission, but the commission to preach the gospel, and they act accordingly. A great number of friends now take this stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With confidence we look for the new fiscal year. The Lord always has provided what his people need, and we trust in Him whose light</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g comes now from the temple, enlighte</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The workers in Iceland are very few; in fact, only one pioneer. But the distribution in that bleak country during the year has totaled 3,230 books and booklets. The work in Iceland is directed from the Northern European branch office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom message does not appeal to people that are holding a lucrative office and ruling over others, or those who are associated with the rulers. The common subjects, however, seeing conditions are unhappy, look to some other than earthly creatures for aid and comfort. Such is the condition in India. The witness work for Jehovah’s kingdom has progressed during the year, but chiefly amongst the natives. There have been 117,689 books and booklets placed in the hands of the people. By far the greater of these is in the native vernacular. From the local director’s report we insert the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Measured by the output of literature and the number of publishers engaged in the work, there has been a general increase. Some sections show a decrease, but others, notably the vernacular work, a very great increase. The total literature placed during the year is 117,639, which is an increase of about 15,000 over the previous year. English books and booklets are slightly less, but vernacular booklets very much more than the previous year’s totals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. Whilst we all recognize that everyone has not the same opportunities for seivice, it is the pioneers who have done most to make up the year’s record. All praise belongs to Jehovah for anything accomplished, and we do not wish to make any distinction between the various branches of field workers, but 25 pioneers (of which 15 are Indian) have done much more actual work than all the remainder of publishers put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">House-cabs. There are three house-cars in. use, and this method of transportation is a great boon. There are some districts in India, and most of Burma, where it is impossible to travel by road, and these districts have, of course, to be worked by train or river steamer. This is costly and inconvenient, for lodging accommodation is scanty and expensive. Taxation makes house-car work rather expensive, but it is more economical in the end and very much more convenient for the pioneer than train travel. One ear carries a cinema equipment and electrical transcription machine, whilst the other two cars carry the transcription mac</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">e only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound machines. We have four electrical transcription machines in use, and good work has been done, but this branch of work is greatly handicaped by reason of the language problem. In places where there are large bodies of Indian Christians a machine with microphone equipment can be used with very good effect if there is someone who can speak to them. In the ordinary course where the English pioneers use the machine they have to rely upon some local friend to read from one of the vernacular booklets, which is not always a satisfactory arrangement. On the other hand, the Indian pioneers who could use the microphone quite well do not possess the necessary ability to keep the machine in proper order. A short tour was made in May by a party consisting of an English pioneer to look after the machine and Indians who did the talking, and a tremendous witness was given. Several meetings were held, and thousands of Indians listened with rapt attention to the message in their own language. Hundreds of booklets contai</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g the same lecture were disposed of, and the response was so great that arrangements are being made now</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■to send an English pioneer along with an Indian into suitable ■districts at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use of the portable gramophone is gradually increasing. As with the electrical machine we find the European element in India entirely indifferent to the message, and it is only on rare occasions that we are able to gain access to their homes. But the English-knowing Indians are more responsive and gradually this feature of witnessing is spreading. About 34,000 people have been witnessed to by means of sound machines during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special campaigns. The special periods set apart for intensive witness have again been richly blessed. The conditions in this part of the world are very different from those obtaining in the western countries. There are few large cities, and most of the company publishers’ are resident in small railway, or other, colonies. There is very little scope for work in a given locality, and such workers are without territory for a considerable part of the year. These special testimony periods afford them a systematic program of work in their local territory. On the other hand, a pioneer often finds it difficult to put in the nine days’ solid work without having to shift to fresh territory and thus unavoidably waste some time in traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Teavancore. The work in Travancore seems to require a special paragraph to itself. Travancore is a native Indian state. It has a population of over four millions, consisting of about one third “Christian”. There are very few large towns. The people are so scattered over the land that it is more like one trig village than several isolated ones. There are about 270 publishers regularly in sei vice, and it is indeed encouraging to be amongst them, and to hear simple peasant folk discuss the latest truths from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> If anyone wants to ■see evidence that the Lord has hid his truth from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes, he should go to Travancore and see Jehovah’s witnesses clad only in a simple cloth witnessing to the flocks of the long-bearded priests of Baal robed in the garments of Babylon. Malayalam is the language spoken in Travancore, and more than 52,000 books and booklets were distributed in this state alone. This is nearly half the total output of literature for the whole of India, Burma and Ceylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vernacular publications. The vernacular literature forms by far the bigger portion of the total output of literature. Ninety thousand booklets were printed during the year in five different languages. We require literature in many more languages, and translations are made only in those which we are best able to handle. It is sometimes difficult, even impossible, </span><span class="font2">to find suitable translators for other languages, but we are doing what we can to provide the Kingdom message for every nation and language” in this far-flung land- It is a costly woik, and we appreciate the assistance given us by our brethren abroad which makes this work possible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Italy has been the seat of government of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and from this point operations are directed throughout the whole earth. The influence of Italy is felt in many places. Without a doubt the Vatican and Mussolini are in full accord and have a clear understanding as to the operations of both. Because of this combined opposition it is impossible to conduct a regular work of publishing the Kingdom message within the borders of Italy. Only two brethren have been able to do any work in that country during the year, and they have worked under great difficulties. Often the literature is taken away from them and they are thrown into prison. One pioneer was shot dead. The Catholic Hierarchy even manifested its venom toward the Lord’s people in interfering with the decent burial of this pioneer, who was witnessing for the Kingdom. In this opposition the &quot;Protestant” clergy join with the Hierarchy, showing that there is not any longer in fact any such organization as Protestants. The clergy prevented the corpse of this brother from being taken to the funeral rooms, the body being left in an old shed without proper attention. People upon hearing of this outrageous treatment, were incensed, and this furnished an opportunity to give them a witness to the truth. Because the deceased had relatives in that neighborhood, they were outlawed by the clergy and were threatened by fire and brimstone because they had given shelter to a &quot;heretic”, thus showing the same infamous spirit as shown in the early days of Italy, when the Inquisition was at its height. One brother still operating in Italy is able to give out some literature. Often the literature sent to him, however, never reaches him, being confiscated by officials under the direction of the Hierarchy. There have been placed in that country approximately 290 books and booklets during the year, according to the best information we can obtain.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jamaica is another place where the poor hear the message gladly while others push it away. The enemy tries to keep the poor in darkness. Yet the Lord will see to it that those who possess a good will toward him shall have an opportunity to know the Kingdom message. The books and booklets distributed in Jamaica during the year and which carry the Kingdom message number 49,018. Amongst other things the local director in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the year 1917 there was not a year that the Devil put forth more strenuous efforts to wreck the work, but there has never been a year in Jamaica when the witnesses put forth more united efforts to drive home the message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The transcription machines and phonographs have played a wonderful part by causing many to take their stand in God’s organization. These machines have broken down many barriers and caused many to give praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the pioneers are few and the number less than those of previous years, yet through the work of the machines the output of literature has increased. During the year we had one general convention and twelve local conventions. Our office has been greatly blessed by the addition of a sedan car by which the staff move in the afternoons to deliver lectures with the transeiiption machine, by which thousands have listened to the glorious message of the kingdom of God. It is impossible to find words to express our gratitude to God for the articles in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Truly the Lord is feeding us with the finest of the wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Washington convention has been a wonderful blessing to all, even though we were not present. The subject on the “great multitude” has heightened our joy and widened our vision. Truly “Zion heard, and was glad”. The Lord has revealed his will and purpose to ub on a question that puzzled us all our life. Praise him for his gracious favor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Although Japan is not classed as a part of ''Christendom”, there is little or no difference between the conditions in Japan and those in other parts of the earth called “Christendom”. It was one of the signatories of the League of Nations, which is linked up with the other elements of Satan’s organization. The government has effectively stopped the distribution of books and booklets, but has permitted the publication of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine, and this is the only means by which the Kingdom message has reached people in that country during the year. These issues of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine are not included in the total distribution of books and booklets, for the reason that they are not in book form. We call attention, however, to the fact that during the year many thousands of issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> containing the Kingdom message were placed with the people. The following is quoted from the report of the brother in that land directing the work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are about a quarter of a million Catholics io Japan. The Catholic Hierarchy has a strong standing in the Kyushu district of Japan. Several numbers of Japanese </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> carried several long articles which exposed the hypocrisy of the Hierarchy and her dirty tricks during last year. Hundreds of thousands of these were distributed all over in Japan and Korea already. I challenged the Hierarchy with an open debate with the representative of the Papal system. My challenge is announced through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and public lectures. The people well remember this challenge, but the Hierarchy is entirely helpless. Of course, the Catholic clergy get mad at us, as well as the Protestant clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Hierarchy had a good standing in </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Amami</span><span class="font2"> Oshima, an island near Kyushu, for last half century. Last January one of Jehovah’s witnesses made a visit to the island and distributed many copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> there. He had to quit the island by the tricks of ‘ ‘ Catholic Fathers ’ who are mostly Frenchmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just two months later a terrible riot broke among Catholics there, many church buildings were burned and wrecked, three thousand Catholics converted to Nationalists and thirteen French missionaries were forced out of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Multitude</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As I have reported to you often, we have no &quot;company publishers&quot; in Japan, and the witnessing work to the glory of Jehovah’s name has been carried mostly by full-time pioneer brethren. Of course, there have been some people who have good will with us always, but we did not know how to class them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, since the question of the &quot;great multitude” was made clear at the Washington convention the people of this class made their appearance quickly in Japan. Fourteen men and women symbolized their consecration with water in the last two months, and two service companies were organized, and the service directors were appointed for both companies already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Light from the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since we were forced to stop the publication of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> in 1933 by the oppression, the Lord provided a way to supply the spiritual food for his own people by the circulatingletter system. Both anointed and Jonadabs are well strengthened and rejoiced with wonderful light which shines forth through God's organization. Also they are well supplied with fresh news of the activity of Jehovah’s organization on the whole earth by the same system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Golden Age”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> in Japanese is the only one organ that we can use for the witnessing work in Japan. It is a monthly publication of eight pages. Each number carries a long article that covers eight full pages. These articles are written according to your writings in books, booklets and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since all books and booklets were prohibited to be distributed in Japan and her territory by the order of the government in July 1933, twenty-four write-ups to the name of Jehovah and his anointed </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">g until last August. We reprint these older numbers more and more. We have 26,000 names in the subscribers’ roll. &quot;We print 40,000 of new number and reprint 60,000 of older numbers every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The subscription for this periodical is thirty sens (or less than ten cents m American money) for one year, with postage included, and two sens for a copy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom work in Korea is directed from the Society’s office in Tokyo, Japan. During the year 1,068,811 copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine in the Korean language were placed in the hands of the people. There 108 engaged in the work. A number of public meetings were held, in which considerable interest was shown by the people. At least, the Korean people are having the opportunity to hear that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs in countries where there is less difficulty fully sympathize with our brethren in Latvia, who labor under such abnormal conditions. The persecution has been great in Latvia during the year, and that government, influenced by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Germany, has done much to hinder the progress of the distribution of the literature. Books and booklets distributed, 1,634. It will be interesting to note extracts from the report of the local director in Latvia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year just ended has been a difficult one. Martial law, which was proclaimed in May 1934, continued during the whole of the financial year and has been extended until February 1936. It was in these abnormal conditions that the Latvian Society (founded in March 1933) was closed in July 1934 and the stock of books on hand seized by the Liquidators, as reported to you last year. At the time the Society was closed the books were not banned, and the friends continued the work with the stocks they had by them. A change came in October, for on the 12th of that month six of the eight booklets we had to work with were prohibited by a decree of the Government and quickly thereafter the homes of the friends were visited and all copies found were confiscated by the police. Of the remaining two booklets, the stock of one was practically exhausted by this time, while the other was in the German language. However, a short time later these two were also banned, followed by further searches by the police. Since then the means of continuing the witness have been limited, except orally. No meetings are allowed and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and Golden </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font2"> magazines are banned publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Early in October an effort was made to establish another Latvian Society, but in this we were not successful. In March and April 1935 Brother Dey was in Riga and made repeated efforts to interview the head of the Government with the object of ending the impasse; an army of secretaries and clerks succeeded in barring the way to this. The Foreign Office, however, admitted that the ostensible ground for the closure of the Society was not the true one. The real reason was that the activities of the Society were undesirable to the Ecclesiastical Department of the home office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On October 7 two telegrams were dispatched to the Hitler Government from companies in Latvia; a third was not accepted by the postoffice at one town. Later it was revealed that the two were stopped by the censor and the brothers who signed them were each subjected to several hours’ interrogation by the political police. The brothers were glad to have this opportunity of giving a witness in one of the dark places where it is difficult for light to penetrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The little company, who on June 2 waited here in expectation, got a real thrill when they heard your voice during the world-wide broadcast on that day. Although only six could understand English, the occasion was a very memorable one. It seemed to draw us closer together and helped us to feel we were all one with our brethren in other lands who, like us, would be listening to the message at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The position in which we find ourselves, which is imposed upon us by the conditions obtaining in the country, is hard to bear. The friends are all anxious to be more active in the Kingdom work. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> which so clearly shows us our privileges and responsibilities, together with reports of what is being done in other lands, make us all the more desirous of having a larger share in the field service. We hope and fully expect that the Lord in his goodness will shortly open a door for us in order that we may be able more effectively to proclaim his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LITHUANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opposition, though great, has not prevented the work from making progress to the praise of Jehovah and his kingdom. From the local director’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A quota of 2,500 books and 15,000 booklets, over twice the total for the preceding twelve months, had been set for Lithuania and Memelgebiet, and we started the year with what seemed to be an impossible task before us. Actually the results have exceeded the quota by 28 percent; for 22,437 books and booklets, or 14,058 more than during last year, have been placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The extra efforts put forth by those who really appreciate their privileges have done much to make these results possible, but it is Jehovah who has given the increase, and to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font2"> our thanks and praise are due. Without his blessing and protection nothing could have been accomplished. That fact can be better appreciated when some of the conditions under which the work is carried on are understood.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font2">Lithuania is a Roman Catholic country, and that means, of course, that few people know anything at all of the Bible, so that Scriptural proof does not mean much to the average person. Quite recently over the radio the statement was made that the Bible was forbidden to common people, and that it was a dangerous book to read. The name of Jehovah is practically unknown, as is evidenced by the manner in which the majority stumble over that word when reading the testimony card. But that that name is being witnessed to is also evidenced by the fact that some, when they reach the words “Jehovah God”, say, “We don’t want anytliing to do with Jehovah.” Others, less “goaty”, have been heard to say to their neighbors as Jehovah’s witnesses go from door to door, “These are the people whose God is Jehovah.” Still others, a small minority, ask as to when we are likely to have some new literature. On the whole the people are kindly disposed, but they are certainly in darkness so far as the Word of God is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Economic and political conditions have gone from bad to worse. There is still no proper outlet for the produce of the country. Germany, once Lithuania’s best customer, now refuses to buy anything, and other markets are, under present world conditions, almost impossible to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three service gatherings have been held during the year, apart from several “drives” by motor-bus in Memelgebiet. On the day set for one of the former, the venue for which was a farm not far front the Latvian border, some interested ones started from twenty miles distant aS early SB three o'clock m the morning. Although the rail fare is only the equivalent of 10 American cents, they had not sufficient to pay it. At about four o’clock it commenced to rain, but they continued with their journey and ultimately arrived literally soaked to the skim Others had come a similar distance by cycle and in farm wagons, so that instead of just a few local friends being at the meeting, as the inclement weather had led us to expect, over fifty attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There has been an average of 15 workers per week in Memel-gebiet during the year. Compaied with the number of permit holders, this is low; but some of the friends there need to work very long hours, even on Sundays, and find it difficult to make the time they do to engage m the service. Others Who have time lack zeal, so that there is a handful who persistently engage in the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom work and thus share in the greatest privilege afforded to human creatures. In the remaining territory there has been an average of 7 workers, as compared with an average of one during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to the above-mentioned figures, nearly 3,000 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> have been placed, in addition to 665 regular subscriptions. As quite a number of the latter are delivered by the publishers themselves, much time has been occupied in this direction and in the obtaining of renewals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The territory embracing Luxemburg is small and consists of two divisions, one called “Gutland”, in the south, and “Oesling”, in the north. Until recently it was possible to give the witness only in Gutland. Oesling is a very mountainous country, difficult to reach, and is under the oppressive hand of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. There are a number of “Orebs” and “Zeebs” in that country, and these have caused the confiscation of literature that the witnesses carried with them. Even though the Hierarchy pressed the charges against brethren who were arrested, in each instance they were acquitted before the court. One pioneer is very active there. He reports some cruel acts on the part of the officers of the law. At the instigation of the clergy the brother was assaulted and beaten until he fell to the ground, and was then cruelly struck and prodded with bayonets. Amidst this opposition the publishing work has been done to some degree in that territory, there being distributed books to the number of 602, and booklets, 5,040, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages,</span><span class="font3"> 1,742, and Bibles, 57. A small convention attended by 50 brethren was held during the year, at .which approximately 50 strangers attended also.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The long and dark regime of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has left the Mexican people in a poor way for advancement, and yet they are getting on top of their difficulties to a large extent. During the year there has been much opposition to the truth by the Hierarchy’s agents, who have incited others to oppose; but, amidst the persecution and opposition, by the Lord’s grace the publication of the message of the Kingdom has exceeded that of any previous year. Reference is made to extracts taken from the report of the local director of service, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Encouraged by the 1033-34 results, at the beginning of this fiscal year we set a quota of ISO workers, 174,000 pieces of literature, 96,000 hours and 108,000 obtainers. I am pleased to state that the Lord has blessed the efforts of the &quot;publishers” in this country, as the quota was left behind. While the average number of workers came only to 164, nevertheless we came as high as 220, and it is much higher than the previous year. It is difficult to give exact figures of actual work done, due to the fact that some friends neglect to report regularly. Following figures show results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Average number of publishers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;164</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of hours in the service &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;103,797</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of obtainers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;116,397</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of books placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,424</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of booklets placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;181,174</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of books and booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;197,598</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Grand total of literature circulated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;207,355</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions, Companies Visited</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Only one convention was held this year; it took place at Vera Cruz. It was fairly well attended, and the friends encouraged. We are now getting ready to have a convention in Monterrey, thus starting the new fiscal year with a first-class campaign and an encouraging convention. Of course, publishers here do not count by the thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instead of conventions, in this fiscal year we aimed at visiting all the groups of interested persons and the companies. Some were visited several times during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio, Transcription, Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Only in the early part of the fiscal year we used radio. Due to the regulations in this country and the fear of stations to broadcast anything that could be taken as &quot;religious”, there was not much chance of doing real radio work, so it was suspended. However, we used longwave and shortwave for broadcasting, and besides the announcements for the literature and the reading of paragraphs from some books we also were able to put across several full lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The transcription machines were not as much used as anticipated, due to the difficulties in transportation. However, we have already started the system of engaging a central location in some of the principal cities and inviting people to the lectures. This method is giving good results. In Mexico City we expect to cover the different &quot;colomas” or boroughs in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The phonographs were kept reasonably busy. In fact, this is about the most practical means in this country. As there are quite a number of homes supplied with phonographs, even in the case of friends not supplied with portable machines, the records can be used. We hope to increase activities along this line. The following are the results of activities under this subheading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total number of radio hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;122</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total meetings with sound equipment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;772</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total attendance at those meetings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,874</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Headquarters—Office, Shipping Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The amount of work and literature handled required the increase of space and office help. Two other rooms were engaged, and two more workers, one of them part of the time. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font2"> the booklets issued in Spanish during the year were translated and proofread at this office, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> (Book Two) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> prepared. The first one is already in Brooklyn. This office supplied all material for the Spanish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The shipping room in Mexico City was kept busy; besides, we shipped literature from three other places, especially from Vera Cruz. From this depot we distribute literature for the campaigns so as to enable the friends to get it in time. During the year the following was sent out:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark139"><span class="font2">Full cartons and large packages</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark140"><span class="font2">Smaller packages</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark141"><span class="font2">Letters</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">The actual shipping figures of literature, taking into consideration the inventories and the literature received during the year, show the following results:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Murder, Threats, Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Prophecy was fulfilled in our midst: ‘And of you shall they cause to be put to death ’ Two of our brethren were murdered by fanatics while engaged m publishing the good news. A number of attacks were reported to this office. In one instance only the determination of two sisters not to leave alone a brother in the hands of his attackers was the means used by Jehovah to shield this publisher from a certain death. True, the Catholic church has not much to say here officially, but at the instigation of priests other church “birds” take upon themselves the task of </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">dering the proclamation of the Truth without invo</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">g the aid of the ‘armed squad’.

<p><span class="font2">Some “lawless” ones thought and a</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ime</span><span class="font2">d to cause difficulties to the work, but, by the Lord’s grace, their angry snarling and barking and mad chasing did not hinder the advancement of this “chariot” of war in Jehovah’s organization.

<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Thia office of the Society is maintained in Denmark and has immediate jurisdiction over the countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, which are more particularly known as the older countries, and, in addition thereto, the small countries along the Baltic sea that were carved out at the redistribution of Europe after the World War. The work has been progressing very well in that part of the earth during the year, with the exception of the Baltic States. Germany has been exercising influence over the Baltic States, working together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The work has been greatly interrupted in those states. In the territory embraced within the Northern European office there have been placed in the hands of the people during the year books and booklets to the number of 1,544,334. The total number of books distributed within the Northern European territory must not be confused with the figures named for each country within that territory. From the local director of service the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Estonia, where we have had the utmost freedom in past years, save that we were shut off the air, our work was stopped in July and doubtless at the same instance. The office and stock rooms were sealed up and our foreign workers brought to a standstill Two English brothers have been giving lectures in Estonian, and quite a lot of interest has been aroused. That doubtless angered the clergy; and, then, our up-to-date message is sharp against the League of Nations, and the authorities profess to be very angry, for they owe their existence in Estonia to it. Our lawyer, however, hid two uidversity professors examine a dozen of our publications, and they certified there was nothing detrimental in them to the interests of the Estonian republic or people. The American </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi m</span><span class="font2">ater, too, made representations, and we have done and are doing all we can to get going again. The first ten months of this year in Estonia gave an increase’over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following table gives a little conspectus of what was done during the six great testimony periods. The autumn and' spring ones were the best we have ever had, constituting two more records. In April we had 2,662' taking part, the greatest number we have ever had out in the work. At the Memorial, 2,759 partook; so 97 percent were out, though, of course, many of them were Jonadabs. In other words, many partaking of the Memorial do not appreciate their privileges.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In the result it will be seen that in these 54 days 875,821 pieces of literature were placed, including 27,211 bound books. We felt fired when each period was over, but glad we had done what we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number out each week on average jumped again this year, from 1,133 to 1,221, and we passed our quota for Northern Europe save&quot; in hours and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> work. The following table sets out the year’s quota and the result actually attained:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We were very happy to see so many bound books spread! 108,787. Our total in books and booklets was thus 1,544,334, the best result ever attained among Northern Europe’s 21 millions of inhabitants. We realize it has been possible only because the Lord has helped us. His due time has come for many of the &quot;great multitude&quot; to hear and accept the invitation, &quot;Come.” They have done so, and now they join us in saying, &quot;Come.” In the 18 months from October 1933 to April 1935 the numbers out for these two periods jumped from 1,809 for all Northern Europe to 2,662, and for the period immediately ahead of us we look forward to seeing still more taking part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Particularly since August 1934, when the two articles &quot;His Kindness” appeared, our work in Northern Europe, as elsewhere over the earth has been colored by the finding of people of good will, the Jonadab or &quot;great multitude” class. The work of our few regional service directors has been very largely along that line. It has been profitable at service conventions and visits to companies to have work meetings, so that ways and means of saying &quot;Come” in the hearing of this class might be discussed. The having of such a distinct objective has greatly assisted us in our year’s work. The Swedish regional service directors have also helped us this year again in Norway, a long and diffi cult and expensive country to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gramophone records. At the same time there has been a great demand for meetings for interested ones all over, so that it is very difficult for our few regional service directors to cope with it. Accordingly, as adumbrated last year, we have experimented in the production of records so that the companies themselves might be in position to hold such meetings as is done in America, England and other English-spea</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">g lands. To be sure, there is the drawback that we cannot have you speaking all these various languages; but as I indicated to you, we have found a good way of overcoming that difficulty and thus preserving uniformity of presentation of the message all over the earth. Placards like the American have been prepared and the talks advertised as Judge Butherford’s turned into Danish. This has proved to be a good method, for it makes clear that the lectures are by the writer of books spread to the extent of 185,000,000 in sixty different languages. Sample records have been made in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Finni</span><span class="font2">sh and, first in September, were tried out in three open-air meetings in Denmark. The results were good, and we are preparing to make as many records as will be needed. The Lord has bo richly blessed this method in other countries that we feel sure the Kingdom interests will also be increased in Northern Europe. We look forward with much interest to this branch of the work next year, when we expect many countries will have Bound machines of one sort or another. We are thankful for your permission to make some experiments in this direction. In some parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland where the distances are great these sound machines will be a great help in the work, especially for pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. Last year our average number was 242 out each week, and this year we have had 245. The results are somewhat less, however, owing to 11 in Latvia having no ammunition. They often went around and witnessed with their Bibles. In all, these 245 spread 579,443, as against 598,716 spread last year. In many instances these workers have come across interested ones and helped them along until they took their stand on the side of Jehovah. Some of the pioneers have been asking about gramophones and records as a help to them in this work. The work of the Valuta Commission has hindered us somewhat in getting the necessary material, but, anyway, it is wonderful to realize the Lord’s leading in the matter. As the need arises he meets it so that the work may better progress to the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘'Director.’’ Of these last year I remarked: &quot;They are the field orders of the Lord’s army this side the veil ” And now the alteration of the name to &quot;Director for Field Publishers’’ just seems to emphasize that this is the case. It is the link between headquarters and the field, and in the result the work goes forward in a uniform manner, as becomes the greatest organization upon earth. The alteration in the color of the testimony cards from time to time is a help, for the public realize ‘this is a new one; we have not seen it before’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Motorboats. The &quot;Ester’’ on the Norwegian coast is doing capital service, and some brethren have one boat each on the Swedish and F</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font2">sh sides of the Baltic, where there are many islands otherwise difficult to come at. Our fleet at the moment is thus one large boat and two smaller ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Golden Age&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last year we had reached 53,000, and now we have an additional 600, having reached 53,635. If we take the single copies and our subscriptions into consideration, about 900;000 copies of this magazine were spread this year, m Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Finni</span><span class="font2">sh, Polish, and German, m Northern Europe. Without a doubt the books and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> are complementary the one to the other. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> wonderful instrument in the Lord’s hands in spreading abroad a knowledge concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, which is the only hope for humanity and which will vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There must be many young people both among the children of the friends and among their friends. When at Helsingfors service convention last month I talked for a few moments with a young F</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font2">sh girl who could speak Swedish. Beally it was enthusing to hear how she had been out on the work one day and spread 4 books and 12 booklets, while next day she had one book and 12 booklets. She was but 13 years of age, and I have wondered whether it would not be good to have some classes for children from 10 to 17 or so: not just to study </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font2"> but that they might be helped to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and to get out in the work. They would m turn witness to their fnends, and so an ever increasing circle Would get a testimony.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The workers in Norway during the year have plodded along and made a fairly good showing. The publishers this year placed in the hands of the people 252,440 books and booklets containing the Kingdom message. Amongst other things the local director m making his report to this office says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is wonderful to see how the Lord is giving us more and more light through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> When we heard of the &quot;great multitude’’, from the Was</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hing</span><span class="font2">ton convention, all of us rejoiced, glad to have this subject in the right place. Jehovah m his own time makes everything clear and plain. We read the answers of the different questions in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and began to understand a little of the subject. Some of us, who can read English, have been glad to partake of the four </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers </span><span class="font2">we already have got. Now the friends are very anxious to get it in our own ‘ Vagttaarnet’. The subject is very interesting so the friends always must talk with each other of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As before reported, it was a great joy for us in Oslo to listen to your speech &quot;Government” from Washington. We had a good hall and got the speech from London per telegraphcable. Some other places in Norway the friends heard it direct by shortwave. All the friends in Oslo and a good many strangers were present, and we were very encouraged to hear your speech and the applause from the 15,000 people Also we arose and shouted <sup>1</sup> Ja’. We have now sent the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government </span><span class="font2">to all workers in Norway. We are thankful to the Lord that Jie will give us the honor to spread it in the October Praise Period, and we hope to get the best result we ever have had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s witnesses and the &quot;great multitude” are going on with joy and perseverance. Especially the companies in Oslo and Skien are very often on Sundays driving in buses and motorlorries 30 to 60 miles away, going over the places just like a locust-swarm. It seems that Satan and his agents this year have not had so much time to disturb us as he did last year. They have had so many difficulties m their own ra</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Oslo we have in the summertime twice a week public meetings in two of the greatest parks. It has been very interesting, and many books have been spread. Some of our new publishers have been interested through these meetings. We have used the transcription machine with music records. Your speechrecords in Norwegian we had not got in the summertime. Now we have received some from Brother Dey, spoken in by Brother Eneroth. They are very clear and good. Soon we will have the records also for phonographs, and that will be the best for Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The two brethren on our motorboat &quot;Ester” are still going on. They are now going from north Norway to the middle of the west Coast, where they will work in some of the great fjords this winter. Last winter they had some hard storms. Sometimes they had to start the motor in the middle of the dark night, when the anchor was not able to hold the boat. One morning the storm took their little ship-boat, earned it over the fjord toward the very great-stoned beach. Just a little place of the beach had no stones, and there the waves threw the boat. When the brethren came and found the boat, some men said to them: &quot;We saw the boat coming, and it is a mnacle that it was not destroyed; so you must have prayed much for this boat.” The brethren on &quot;Ester” are doing a very good work on such places, where the people can’t be reached otherwise. This year they have spread 9,357 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have still great fields in Norway to work in. It is only in some greater towns we have reached to do a lot of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Oslo, Bergen and Skien the witness is given from two to eight times a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all we have sent out 254,263 books and booklets. The publishers have placed 252,440 books and booklets. It is 29,993 more than last year. We have sent out 7,000 copies </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Director. </span><span class="font2">Twelve companies are organized for service, and 295 friends participated m the witness work; 88 more than last year. Average number each week, 133. Thirty pioneers and auxiliaries have been out, two more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publishers have not reached all the territory in Norway. As the facts show, there are many places in the far north country and amongst the mountains that the people have not yet heard the Kingdom message. It is difficult to reach them, but the Lord in his goodness will send somebody in there to do that work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Philippine islands are one of the dark spots on the map, having been ruled for centuries by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its dupes. Since the United States has taken them over there has been some progress in their educational matters and some towards seeing the good news of God’s kingdom. The Society has a branch ofSee at Manila. There are about 40 publishers in the field, and these have placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year a total of 42,455 books and booklets. Says the report of the local director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many persons in Manila and other parts of the islands are beginning to know Jehovah. The Jonadab class is being manifested in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since last year the brethren have spread all over the islands, and not one of them complains, which shows that the Lord is richly blessing them. Praised be our heavenly Father for keeping us in tins work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The people in the Philippines are extremely poor, and many thousands are now unemployed, due to the economic depression. For this reason the placement of bound books is not very high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Philippines consist of thirteen large islands and several thousand small islands; and we still need a few more pioneers, and I believe the Lord in due time will raise them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Poland during the year has made progress, by the grace of the Lord. There has been no increase in the number of companies, but there has been an increase in their activities. The organization has been better, and their appreciation of the privilege of serving has increased. Quite a number of Jonadabs have come forward and shown an appreciation of the Lord by participating in the service. This has increased the number of publishers. The local director of service reports, and the following is quoted from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneer work in our country shows a very satisfying increase. Many Polish brethren who formerly resided in northern France or Belgium, and who were Bent from the country, have taken up the work in their own land. There have been 7,887 books placed this year, to compare with the 4,341 of last year; 61,560 booklets, to compare with 55,018 of previous year. Without doubt this increase is due to better organization for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A comparison of this year’s work with that of the previous</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font2"> the special service periods were always attended with very great joy among the Lord is people in this country, and all gladly participated in the field service. Hardly was one battle fought when the brethren already reported from various parts of the country that they prepared themselves with joy for the next world-wide campaign. Therefore, the results of those months in which there was a service period were always twice as good .as those of the other months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the witness work increased during the past year, the clergy got more and more infuriated. There were more than 3,000 cases where brethren were denounced by the clergy to the authorities because they proclaimed the truth. We took up their defense, and in most cases the procedure was dropped, while the other eases ended with acquittals. Nearly always the charge was that the peddlers’ laws had been violated, but these charges could usually be proved unfounded. Then it was claimed that the old press-law of the year 1851 had been violated, then the press-law of 1874, and further various police ordinances of the years 1912, 1924, 1928, etc., and finally the charge of disturbing the Sunday rest was also raised. However, as there was nd evidence of any real violation of any ordinances, in all instances the brethren were acquitted. In their despair, the clergy foamed more and more with rage. As they do not see any other way out, almost everywhere in the country they have now chosen the method of defending themselves with hands and feet, stones, sticks, laths, etc., and this wherever witnesses of Jehovah go from house to house to give the testimony to the people of good will. The brethren are ill-treated, flogged till the blood comes and they lay unconscious on the ground; they are robbed of their literature, which is sometimes burnt publicly. There were, all together, 41 cases of ill-treatment. Some of the worst cases were taken to the worldly courts, so that the enemy should get convinced in this respect as well as that there is a hmit to his actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The enemy naturally pursues this course in order to in</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">timi</span><span class="font2">date Jehovah’s witnesses, discourage them and frighten the people of good will; but he is losing out. Thanks to the wonderful food which the consecrated are provided with through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> it is no more possible to discourage them, and there where base and vile acts of violence are resorted to against the Lord’s people, the truth is spreading all the more powerfully, and often Catholics of good-will openly side with the brethren attacked, defen</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">din</span><span class="font2">g and protecting them. Thus the enemy is defeated again and again, while the Lord’s people are marching from victory to victory as the great day of the Lord draws nearer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Doubtless in no part of the earth do the brethren work with greater difficulties than in Rumania. At one time the Society’s work was progressing splendidly there, until the one in charge became a traitor and joined the “evil servant” class and worked with the enemy to destroy the work. The publishing, however, has not ceased. Those who are really devoted to the Lord have continued putting forth their best endeavors under the greatest handicap and have held up the banner of the King and Kingdom. The year has been fraught with many severe trials, but this has not caused the faithful to slacken their hand. From the report of the local director of service the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On June 19, 1935, at 8 p.m., the police called at the office of the Society in order to search the house by the order of the minister of cults. They intended to carry away all correspondence, account books, etc., and in fact took the books and a part of the correspondence out of the office, which later, only by force, could be got back again. The street door was watched by a police official, so that no one could leave the house, and that they could work through the whole night undisturbedly. In spite of this precaution one left the house by a back door and went to the Society’s lawyer, who is a senator, and he took the matter up immediately, got in touch with a competent authority over the telephone, and thus this illegal action was stopped. The books and correspondence were returned, and only 12,050 booklets remained under ban. As the confiscated booklets were previously pronounced free for distribution by the highest judicial authority, there is now a lawsuit pending about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">False brethren, who with the clergy and their general, the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi-m</span><span class="font2">ater of cults, had been used by Satan, caused these troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 35 cases there were ill-treatments of brethren by policemen, there wore 17 arrests, and on the w]iole the brethren spent 60 days in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It rejoices the heart as one only casually scans the result of the work done by pioneers in this land, but much more so when one considers the difficulties encountered by them. The number of pioneers remains about the same as last year. The number of hours worked, however, has been doubled to 13,718, the number of books placed is somewhat less than last year, but there is an increase in the number of booklets, from 25,096 last year to 46,913 this year. The work has been better organized, which has helped to more successful results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all the attacks of the Devil Jehovah preserved us, and the work has progressed by about 30 percent, as shown by the following figures:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">There are fewer publishers, but the blessing of the Loid has not diminished, as is evidenced by the result of the efforts put forth during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren in other parts of the earth fully sympathize with our brethren in Rumania and rejoice to be classed with those who are reproached for the name of Christ. The day of deliverance draws nigh.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>SAAR BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This part of the earth’s surface was under the control of the League of Nations until the middle part of the year 1935. It was then returned to Germany. In the first months of the year Jehovah’s witnesses put forth an effort there to publish the testimony. They worked 10,964 hours; placed books, 2,465; booklets, 26,941; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine, 11,265. Now, under the control of the German nation and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the publication of the Kingdom message is stopped. The people, however, of that little country have received a fair warning, and certainly the clergy a plain warning, as the Lord has commanded through the prophecy of EzekieL</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">From Madrid, Spain, the Society’s work is conducted both in Spain and in Portugal. There has been some increase in the publication of the Kingdom message during the year, although there have been many handicaps and many difficulties to overcome. The work in these countries at all times has been carried on at the expense of the American office. The people are poor, paper is high, import duties very high, and consequently the contributions are very small. In Spain this year there have been placed in the hands of the people 105,860 books and booklets. In addition thereto, Bibles to the number of 110, and the magazine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age {Lus y Verdad),</span><span class="font3"> 39,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are a few workers in Portugal, and the distribution here has been small, a total of 11,104 books and booklets being put in the hands of the people; but this far exceeds any year in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has a printing press at Madrid, with which booklets are manufactured, and thus the cost of production is somewhat reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average number of pioneers in Spain during the year is 12, none of them being Spaniards. However, some Spaniards have offered to enter the pioneer work, but they have the burden of large families and this makes it almost impossible for them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Says the local director:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of the pioneers has been growing increasingly more difficult as the Jesuit party has been gai</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g power. They are once again manifesting their arrogance and intolerance in the many ways familiar to us all, getting our pioneers driven out of towns or villages, inciting the authorities against them and admonishing the people not to read our literature, both from the pulpits and through the press and parish magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As an illustration of the rank hypocrisy of the Devil’s agents, it is interesting to note that one of the reasons given for the expulsion of the two pioneers was that ‘they were distributing literature of a “Jewish-Masonie tendency” whereas the two Bisters who were recently imprisoned were charged by the governor erf the province with distributing &quot;booklets, of Hitleristie character&quot; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Who Shall Rule the World?').</span><span class="font2"> None but poor, blind Catholics could swallow such nonsensei In other instances, the Press labels us as &quot;Protestants-&quot;, and since the vast majority of Catholics in Spam have no idea what a Protestant is, believing that he is the worst </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">d of infidel, a &quot;heretic&quot;, as they are fond of calling them, the people get frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are few service workers in Spam, but it is a constant pleasure to receive the reports of several publishers scattered in different parts of the country, who are loyally and faithfully doing what lies in their power to give the witness, often at the cost of great difficulties fiom their families and friends. It costs something to be a witness for the Lord in this country, but the joy and enthusiasm manifested by those who are thus active show that they have their reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although this year started off with a revolution, the effects of which have not yet died down, and the prospects did not look too hopeful, we are all very grateful to Jehovah for the many privileges we have enjoyed in the witness work and for the wonderful way in which he has enabled us to carry on in spite of growing difficulties. The &quot;man of sm&quot; class has, of course, also shown itself here, but this only serves to make us niore determined to maintain our integrity to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Jesuits since ousted have been subtly and vigorously at work to regain power, and indications are that they are likely to succeed. The “old wench” is perking up all over the earth, but we should remember the words of the Lord: &quot;Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Portugal, the local director’s report states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Increase in a country such as Portugal is most encouraging and is due in a great measure to the activities of three German pioneers who have been working there during this time, assisted by a Brazilian brother who has also taken part in the pioneer work; for the participation of the company publishers is almost negligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Portugal is a most difficult country for the witness work. For centuries it has been priest-ridden, it is steeped m ignorance and fanaticism, and the poverty of the people as a consequence of several years’ ruthless Jesuit dictatorship is simply appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Little wonder/then, that the results obtained there are negligible m comparison with the amount of time and energy spent. ■So much the greater, therefore, has been the faith and devotion of those faithful brethren who, laboring daily for long hours, have scarcely been able to scrape together sufficient for a bare existence. For the same reason, the constant efforts of the few company publishers who have persisted in the face of such discouragement are most commendable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to offset these disadvantages m a measure, the rates of contributions for literature have been repeatedly reduced -from their already low level. This, together with the exorbitant .customs duties charged on it, has meant a very heavy economic burden for the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is impossible to conceive of the work’s being carried on in Portugal without considerable sacrifice on the part of all and of its bearing very much fruit under the existing conditions. It makes one long for Buch opportunities as are now opening up in many countries with the transcription sets, housecars, etc., whereby the millions of illiterate people would be able to obtain the comfort of our message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The strangle hold of the Papal Hierarchy and its abominable effects make us take up Habakkuk’s &quot;cry” to Jehovah, while .we rejoice in the knowledge that -God Almighty is about to shortly clear his name and completely wipe out that iniquitous system.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The zealous workers of Sweden have been active ■during the year and responding obediently and joyfully to the command of the King of kings. The results of their earnest efforts show an increase in the distribution of books and booklets over the year previous. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in Sweden during the fiscal year is 484,233 volumes. Extracted from the report of the local director is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Good as it has been to be able to carry on without any outside trouble at all, this very fact has, however, been causing some to wonder whether there be something wrong with us, seeing that we did not get any share of the persecutions which have come to our brethren in other countries m such nch measure. But then our gracious Lord made the matter clear to us, by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower’s</span><span class="font2"> explanation of the oneness and partaking with one another which exists in the body of Christ and how the Father is counting those ill deeds as done to all the company of his anointed ones. And so we rejoice and look forward to the happy time when we shall be able, by his grace, to share with onr brethren the joy of seeing his name fully vindicated and all his faithful people released to serve him without let or hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year just ended started, one could say, in the sign of this wonderful oneness among the witnesses for Jehovah, when we all joined in sending those telegiams of protest to the Government in Germany. Although the telegrams from this country were stopped by the State Board, the protests from our companies got there by mail anyway, and it became a mighty witness to some of our authorities here, causing a stream of correspondence back and forth between various boards and local authorities, which lasted for months and gave them quite a bit of information about us and our work. And some stated that they must admire such a courageous action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That united action was one of the two peaks of the year’s experiences. The other was the revelation given us through your talk at the Washington convention re the ‘' great multitude”. Through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> and a private letter we learned about this wonderful news just at the time our annual convention was in session here at Stockholm, and so the friends were told about it (all details, of course, being referred to the full explanation to come in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> in due time), and they were all just filled with joy and gratitude. The witnesses and the Jonadab brethren were equally glad, I dare say, of this really wonderful light and went away to show their appreciation by faithfully carrying out the co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font2"> an ri m e-n tn of Jehovah. During the following months little gatherings and service conventions have been held in various parts of the country and members of the ‘‘great multitude” class have come forth and symbolized their consecration with deep gratitude and appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is, of course, because of the help given by this class, many of whom are young and vigorous, whereas some of the witness company are growing bodily old and weak, that we have been able to show not only more publishers out on the work but more hours worked, too. The total number of publishers holding permit from this office was 890, and they have worked well over 150,000 hours. This is an increase of 34 publishers and about 10,000 hours. The greatest number out on the witness work at any time was during the Thanksgiving Period, when 919 took part in the service. This year we also had, for the first time, more partakers in the work than in the Memorial. There were 1,059 attending that feast, but only 907 took part of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As already mentioned, we have had the privilege of placing more hterature with the public than ever before, the total being 484,233. That which gives us the greatest satisfaction in this connection is the fact that the bound books have been placed to the number of 48,649, or an increase above last year of 11,283. This is the highest figure ever for bound books, and it is, in. fact, several years since the bound-book figure showed an increase. This is due to more time having been devoted to this feature of the work, and especially the Fruit-Bearers’ Period in August, when more books were placed than has often been the case during a whole month. Booklets have been placed to the number of 435,584, or an increase of 14,157. The total increase on last year thus comes to 25,440.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is an increase also in the number of subscriptions taken for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> the number being now 23,624, the highest ever, and before the calendar year is up we expect to have passed the 24,000 mark and be getting on toward the 25,000 one. The best with this magazine is that it is, as Brother Dey puts it, “a Jonadab-finder.” Where this magazine finds its way the books are sure to follow, and presently the subscriber writes in for more books to spread among his neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> also shows a healthy increase in the number of subscribers, 2,030, against 1,808 last year. Last year’s increase was 208, and this year it is 222. The “great multitude’’ brethren cannot do without </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> any more than the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneers have been engaged in the service to the number of 61 (three more than last year), the average number being 53 (four more than last year). Their total output has been 190,179, which is 2,200 less than last year, but this drop in total number is more than made up for by the fact they have placed 3,863 more bound books than last year (24,480 against 20,617), and they have, additionally, taken 4,350 subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> which is 509 more than last year. Two brothers have been using a motorboat, and during the last three months of the fiscal year they have called upon the isolated people at 284 islands along the east coast south for Stockholm, where they placed, with 1,053 receivers, 428 books, 1,145 booklets, 68 subscriptions and 496 loose copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font2"> Several of those little islands had never been visited before with the message of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The wonderful and most timely message contained in the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> will certainly prove a mighty weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was a thrilling experience when those English-speaking among us heard it over the radio when it was delivered at Washington, and we have been longing ever since for the time when we should be able to let the people read it for themselves. And that time is now here. And so when the world powers are tottering and the sky is darkening more and more for those in Satan’s organization, Gideon’s little band will sally forth with their trumpets and torches and let the battle cry ring: “For Jehovah and for Gideon!” ffis Government is now to take control and rid the earth of all wickedness! Is it any wonder that His people are joyful and happy amidst all trials and difficulties ?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">With a population of only about four million persons Switzerland has received probably the most thorough witness of any country of its size on earth. Its people are democratic and liberal-minded and are considerate of the privileges of others. The exception to this rule is the Catholic Hierarchy and those whom they influence. The work has been opposed in every way by priests, aided and abetted by their allies and the so-called &quot;Protestant” organization. Recently the Catholics and Nazis attempted to have the fundamental law changed to limit the freedom of speech in this land, but were defeated. The religious newspapers continue to attack the Lord’s work there. From the report of the director of service in Switzerland the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without a doubt we are the subject of much discussion in Catholic circles, and utterances of the clergy and newspapers betray their designs against our activity. For example, we call attention to two notices from Catholic papers: ‘ ‘ The sad part of the whole story is that in our Switzerland the distributors of such offensive matter against good citizens can go quietly on, and have the protection of the authorities. We demand the immediate seizure of this hterature which is deeply offensive to more than a milhon Swiss citizens. We ask, Is the city, cantonal and state government not just and strong enough to carry through this measure? If not, then we as Catholics will organize a defense which will give us that right before God and the world. In iho future we will then see to it that in every Catholic community such representatives of hatred and lies shall he seized and with loaded cudgels be made to pay for their doings. This will perhaps not stop their lies, hut their coming again. We demand an answer from the authorities immediately. The measure is full, and our patience is at an end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remarks of a Catholic priest, Ho</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">lzm</span><span class="font2">an-n, Triengen (Luzerne), With reference to the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">‘ ‘ This publication reveals a mass of Biblical distortions, absurdities, and mean slanders, misleading to the people and appealing to the lower human tendencies. And We Catholics should consent to such a work? Surely there are legal njeans at hand to prevent these fellows, who are misleaders of the people, from doing such harm. Shall we not use our power? We earnestly beg the competent authorities to take sharp action against these malicious Bible Students and give them what they deserve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In diSerent parts of Switzerland our pioneers have been meanly treated, put into prison, and without a chance to defend themselves, sent from the canton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In November of last year Berne was the scene of a unique and very interesting court ease, that of the Protocols of Zion, Which created quite a sensation. Upon the proposal of the defendants the ease was interrupted and resumed again in April of this year. A new expert witness was summoned, the German Lt. Col. Fleischliauer, owner of the U. Bodung Publishing House, and manager of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Weltdienst</span><span class="font2"> (“World Service”). In the evidence presented by Pleischhauer, which lasted for days, among other slanderous remarks, he stated that the Bible Students’ organization have openly set as their aim the establishment of world rule by Israel. Thereby Fleisehhauer misinterpreted the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in such an unheard-of way that we felt it necessary to protest, and to accuse him of using misleading Jesuit methods. Whereupon Fleischhauer entered complaint against us, out of which a case is now pending. It is known throughout the world that the Berne Court declared these Protocols of Zion to be plagiarized and trash. Mention having been made in this case of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, the attention of the public far and wide was drawn upon Jehovah, and thus a great witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;LIga&quot; Exposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout the month of September an exposition was held in Zollikofen, near Berne, exhibiting the agricultural, horticultural, and industrial products of the canton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font2"> visitor to the exposition was greatly displeased upon seeing an exhibit of our books, saying that it was quite out of place in an exposition of this kind to have the attention of the people drawn to books of such a nature. The books alluded to were those of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which bring hope and comfort in this critical time and in the true sense of the word are educational.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many people of good will know the members and work of this printing organization and are convinced that it is a purely unselfish work carried on for the good of their fellow men. To the homes of the people is brought a most comforting and satisfying message, helping to a better understanding of the Bible as God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is unthinkable that this visitor to the exposition has no knowledge of the contents of these books and of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses carried on so actively and openly for years. It is also surprising that the clerical </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Berner-Tagblatt</span><span class="font2"> should permit its columns to be used to convey the slanderous remarks of this &quot;Inga” visitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have written the editor of this paper, also an article entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font2"> Slander as Usual” is to appear in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font2">It is not the first time, however, that this paper has scoffed and sneered in an insulting way at the acknowledged noble-minded work of the Watch Tower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the abusive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tagblatt</span><span class="font2"> article, among other things, it was asserted that the witness of Jehovah’s witnesses was not a witness, but a business proposition carried on by means of their publications. It is well known to everyone who has honestly and without prejudice examined the contents of this literature, and who has come into contact with the representatives of this organization, that this is a slanderous statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The answer to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tagblatt</span><span class="font2"> article follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Gentlemen,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Herewith a necessary reply to your news-item entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘A</span><span class="font2"> Beauty Defect in the Liga’, published in your issue of September 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;There may, of course, be some men who wonder that a solid publis</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">g firm which has existed in Berne for years, and has always met its obligations, should be represented at the ‘Liga’ in Zollikofen, because such people have had until now no opportunity of lear</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font2">g the purpose of this firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;However, it seems strange that any person should wonder that in a Christian canton, at a decent exhibition, there should also be represented a Christian publishing house, namely, the editors of Jehovah's witnesses, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society in. Berne. This Society is registered in the Swiss Registry of Commerce as a philanthropic organization, without monetary aims, and the purpose of which, as stated in its charter and by-laws, is to prepare in its own printing plant books and booklets explaining the Bible and to distribute these. Briefly stated, to render the Bible popular. For t</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font2"> purpose an exposition as the ‘Riga’ should be the proper place, particularly since the Watch Tower Society was officially invited to participate without having previously applied for entry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ Astonishment or admiration is all right, but it is false to claim that the witnesses of Jehovah are doing business with printed paper. The publishing house itself, as has been officially proved, does not do any commercial business, and as regards Jehovah’s witnesses as individuals, they joyfully sacrifice their all in the cause of God’s </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font2">gdom. As is evidenced in Germany and in other lands, they are, by the thousand, being cruelly persecuted and slandered for the sake of their faith, which can hardly be considered as a commerce, but which should call forth sincere admiration from all rightly t</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hinkin</span><span class="font2">g people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It is more than unfair to ironically ridicule God-fearing men and their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Many have expressed themselves admiringly to see God’s Word represented at the ‘Liga’, and then again the Bible and Christianity are neither of American nor of Swiss origin.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The attendance at the exposition was exceedingly good throughout, and the visitors passing our stand would pause to express their co</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font2">endation that in such a place God’s Word should be represented. Over 5,000 catalogues and more than 500 books, booklets and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">G. A.</span><span class="font2"> copies were placed with the people. Phonograph records were also sold. At the entrance to the exposition a large and beautiful placard advertising </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> was hung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without hesitation we can say that through this exposition a splendid witness was given to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through books and booklets a witness was given in Switzerland as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There has been an increase of 12,870 hours and 52,471 booklets over last year. This is striking evidence that the Catholic and Protestant clergy have not in any way intimidated the true witnesses of God’s kingdom. The anointed fear neither men nor the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of the increasing attacks by the police and the press against Jehovah’s witnesses, we have published a leaflet entitled “Jehovah’s witnesses, Who Are They, and What Is Their Aim?” and 200,000 of these have been distributed in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year, there have been 148 arrests, and 111 court cases; 45 were decided in our favor; 49 days were spent in prison by various brethren who refused to pay the fines imposed. Ers. 1,629 in fines and costs were spent in this past year.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Instead of Jehovah’s witnesses’ being a commercial organization, the following is a sample of what the workers do at their own expense: For their train and omnibus transportation during the year they paid out of their own pockets the sum of 33,178.24 francs; for their lodgings, 2,660.50 ftancs; miscellaneous, 4,885.45 francs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were eight service conventions held in Switzerland during the year, with an attendance of 1,480. In other parts of Central Europe, 9, with an attendance of 1,455.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society maintains its branch office for the Levant states, Lebanon and Syria, at Aleppo, Syria. The work continues under much handicap, and yet the brethren there are zealous and put forth their best endeavors to publish the truth. During the year only one pioliedr has'been in the service, one auxiliary, and 19 company publishers, making a total of 21. Together they have put in 5,390 hours in the service and placed in the hands of the people a total of 6,927 books and booklets. The local director in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past fiscal year for Syria has been the period of persecution and propagation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the first quarterly a celebrated evangelical “Reverend”, a worldly enemy of the Watch Tower, came from America to Syrian and Aleppo; to destroy the Watch Tower and to </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">a-nni</span><span class="font2">-hilate it from Syria, as his men told us. And from their pulpit he horribly attacked the Society. And one day he declared that he has many things to do against Bussellism, and just at this time he became suddenly sick, and remained three months in bed. He returned to the U. S. A. sick and noiseless. Afterwards a celebrated Armenian journal at Beirut, Syria, attacked the Watch Tower in two long articles. And in the March issue of the Armenian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> by my letter with the title ‘‘The Persecution Has Been the Propagation”, I gave information that at this period we have had an incomparable success at Aleppo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On May the 8th two detective policemen confiscated from the office and from the depot of Aleppo’s W.T.C. the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> and that very week we began a Bible study using that same book, which we had neglected for a long time, and which we continue uninterrupted until today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The little company at Lebanon, working under the direction of the Society’s office from Aleppo, reports that the lecture on “Government” from Washington, D.C., was heard and much appreciated. The books and booklets distributed by the company during the year total 4,500.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The publication of the Kingdom message covering Port of Spain and ne,ar-by islands has progressed from Trinidad during the year, the total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people being 47,357. This shows a decrease of bound books, but an increase in the booklets during the year. From the local director’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren in these islands (Trinidad, Tobago, St. Vincent, Grenada, Dominica, Barbados, Antigua) have had many blessings, also some difficulties. They have especially appreciated the way in which the Lord has helped them, with your cooperation, to acquire and use transcription machines, which reach some who would not pay attention to anyt</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font2">g else. Numbers of people gather regularly at certain parks and other places where some of these are m use every week and much enjoy the lectures. This work is gaining such momentum that attendance of upward of 90,000 is reported, also many stay in their homes and listen; this is sometimes disclosed when they are afterwards called upon with the literature. At the meetings remarks like the following are often overheard: &quot;There is no work and this is the only consolation; let us draw near.” &quot;That’s right, boy, come here and listen, don’t go back to Belmont and let that man fool you any more.” &quot;I would like 5,000 women to hear that lecture; they are the ones that the priests fool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A report from one of the islands describes the year just passed as &quot;a year of depression and heavy tropical rains”. Demonstrations of the unemployed, which commenced in the preceding year, have continued to such an extent that the government of this island has issued prohibiting proclamations. The stringency of conditions amongst the people is reflected in the literature which they have obtained, showing a falling off in bound books, but an increase in the booklets, which have reached their highest point so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a large number of persons who like and approve of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font2">gdom message; we are trying to show them the importance of taking a definite stand on the side of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is always eagerly received. Jehovah’s people know how he sends them what is necessary that they may grow strong thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> is also much appreciated, and by a wide circle. Hundreds of distributor copies of each issue aie circulated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Yugoslavia the following languages are used: Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, German, Rumanian, and Hungarian. The small number of witnesses employed in the service must meet the requirements in all these languages. Many of the people are unable to read. Sometimes a whole village is entirely illiterate. This is another sample of the priest-ridden Roman Catholic country. Yet there are some who are anxious to know about God’s kingdom. The local service director’s report sets out certain facts, from which the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year all together 69 publishers participated regularly in the service from house to house, while the previous year we had had 98 publishers. The number of 69 ineludes 9 Jonadabs who join in the service. In the Memorial 109 brethren participated. This shows that many of them do not appreciate the privilege of service. One reason why this year there were fewer publishers in the field is that the adversary, through his tool, the &quot;evil servant&quot; class, succeeded in getting some of the companies completely on his side, so that these not only did not participate in the work, but even opposed it. However, in view of the decline in the number of publishers, those remaining saw and appreciated their privileges of service and they have been more zealous to make up the deficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While last year the 98 publishers spent a total of 29,293 hours in the field and placed 102,569 publications in the hands of the people, the 69 publishers who engaged in the work during the year under consideration worked, all together, 35,170 hours and distributed 94,105 books and booklets. There is therefore a decline in the output of booklets as compared with the previous year, while the number of bound books placed this year exceeds that of last by 2,865. We are very grateful to the Lord that in spite of the great economic depression prevailing in this country he has granted us such success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special service periods were greatly blessed. While the year before an average of 86 publishers participated in these periods, spending together 7,140 hours in the field and placing 25,211 books and booklets, this year 69 publishers were able to distribute 26,059 publications in 8,852.5 hours of work. This again shows that the brethren endeavored to make up for the deficiency in putting in more hours, and the Lord granted his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year there was only one regional service meeting. Approximately 230 brethren and Jonadabs were present, whereof 212 took part in the service from house to house, placing in 260 hours 964 books, booklets and copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font2"> In this result we see also the blessing of the Lord, and are full of gratitude, for this work was done in a place where most people have already taken their stand either for or against the Kingdom. The public lecture held on this occasion was also very well attended, this being a good opportunity for giving the witness. There was not the slightest trouble, although the meeting place was situated hardly a hundred meters away from the palace of the Catholic bishop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now as to the experiences of the publishers in the field, we see that it is always the clergy and their allies who interfere with the witness and want to destroy it. Especially the Catholic tools are doing all they can to throw suspicion on Jehovah’s witnesses and to elander them before the people. Although many times they succeed m inciting their blind followers and other credulous people against the Lord’s work and servants, yet even in the rurals they have lost credit with -most of the people and many have now a desiie to find out for themselves what the tiuth is and like to read our literature, even, if they often do it in secret for fear of the prison keepers.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The foregoing is a brief resume showing the results of the efforts put forth by the publishers of the message of Jehovah’s kingdom during the twelve months just passed. During that period the opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses has been greater than any other time during the Elisha period of the Lord’s work. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, its allies and dupes, directed by Gog, the Devil’s chief field agent, has fought desperately during the past twelve months to bring greater reproach upon Jehovah’s name and to prevent the people from learning of his kingdom. No doubt the almighty God laughs at their feeble efforts and holds them in derision. This we do know, that Jehovah has sent forth his witnesses to give the testimony concerning his name and his kingdom and those witnesses have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets containing the Kingdom message to a greater number than in any previous year. Many persons who never heard of the Lord’s kingdom before have learned about it this year, and thus the great multitude are beginning to march toward the Kingdom. During the fiscal year this work of publishing the Kingdom message has resulted in placing in the hands of the people books and booklets to the total number of 26,322,854. That, added to the total number reported in previous years, brings the total distribution of books and booklets since the beginning of the publication of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> in 1921 up to 205,217,917 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the work of the Lord and marvelous in our eyes, and to him we give all the praise. In taking into consideration the amount of literature placed during the year we should keep in mind the great hindrance put in the way of the work in many countries. In Austria, Germany, Italy and Danzig the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has largely succeeded in keeping the people in ignorance of the Kingdom. Had the publication of the truth been uninterrupted in these countries many millions more would have heard the message. It has placed more responsibility upon the Hierarchy, and for which that wicked organization must shortly account to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the present time the Lord is permitting the devil worshipers to put on their garments and thus identify themselves as of the company that must be destroyed at Armageddon. At the same time those of good will are permitted to identify themselves by taking their stand on the side of the Lord. There is every reason for Jehovah’s witnesses and those faithful Jonadabs who have joined themselves to the chariot to greatly rejoice. The Lord has not revealed to his people just how soon he will begin to express his wrath against the Devil’s organization in the final conflict at Armageddon, but there are many things in the prophecies that indicate this time of great tribulation upon Satan’s organization is near at hand. The faithful will continue m the joy of the Lord to march forward singing the praises of Jehovah and his King as they go, and do with their might what their hands find to do to vindicate Jehovah’s name. This report is joyfully submitted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Minutes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Agreeable to the charter and by-laws and notice duly published, the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was held at Pittsburgh, North Side, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on the 31st day of October, A.D. 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meeting was called to order by C. A. Wise, vice-president. The vice-president read a communication from the president of the Society stating reasons for his inability to be present and communicating in brief the substance of the annual report prepared by him. Upon motion duly put and carried, the annual report of the president was ordered printed in the usual form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chair then called upon the secretary to submit the facts as to the number of votes present in person or by proxy. It appeared from his report that 134,931 votes were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thereupon the chair declared that the nomination for the board of directors was in order. Motion was made by George McLamb that the following-named persons be put in nomination for board of directors for the ensuing term of three years, to wit: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">J. F. </span><span class="font3">Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Amburgh, A. H. Macmillan, T. J. Sullivan, G. Y. McCormick, and H. H. Riemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Motion was made and duly seconded to suspend the rule with reference to voting by ballot and that the secretary be requested to cast the entire vote. This motion was unanimously carried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The secretary then cast the entire vote of 134,931 votes, and the chair declared that the following-named persons were elected as directors of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to serve during the term of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">three years from this date, to wit: J. F. Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Amburgh, A. H. Macmillan, T. J. Sullivan, G. Y. McCormick, and H. H. Riemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next order in business being that of electing officers for the corporation, George McLamb put in nomination the following persons as officers, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For president, J. F. Rutherford;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For vice-president, C. A. Wise;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For secretary and treasurer, W. E. Van Amburgh. There being no other nominations, upon motion duly put and carried, the rule to vote by ballot was suspended and the secretary directed to cast the entire vote for the persons named, which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thereupon the chair declared the following-named persons duly elected to be officers of the Society for the term of three years, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For Jehovah and for Gideon.&quot; —Judg. 7:18, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">TEHOVAH’S NAME shall be vindicated. His I faithful witnesses will participate therein. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font0"> Those on the earth are small in number and weak in themselves. Their strength is in the Lord, whom they implicitly trust. The victory God will bring through Christ Jesus, the Greater Gideon, and of that there is not the slightest doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The visible division of the enemy host, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is daily growing more arrogant, aggressive, bold and scornful. Tormented by the zeal and activities of Jehovah's witnesses, who declare the truth to the people, and apparently making progress in suppressing those witnesses, it may be expected that soon the enemy will say to each other: “Peace and safety/’ Then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah answers that he will “do his work, his strange work; . . . his act, his strange act”, and thus will express his wrath against his hypocritical enemies. The Lord is maneuvering the enemy forces to that very point. In his due time he will rise up. Knowing this, every faithful servant of God will now be very courageous. The witness work must be done before destruction falls upon the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because of full assurance of faith in Jehovah and in Christ Jesus, and because they delight to do God’s will, the anointed and their companions will not slack the hand now, but in the joy of the Lord will press forward, shouting as they march: &quot;For Jehovah and for Gideon,” the mighty Vindicator of His Name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The “isles” here shall, the prophet declares, in due time worship Jehovah and contribute toward his service. (Zeph. 2:11; Ps. 72:10) They shall pay tribute to him, glorify and praise Jehovah. The isles that seek the Lord profit by the message of the kingdom, and of them the prophet of God wrote: “Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands.” (Isa. 42: 12) These islands have a desire for righteousness. Coming in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses and recognizing them as his servants, they gladly minister to them and are the ones that go to make up the “sheep” class whom the Lord puts on his right hand and approves. The prophecy says, “Hearken, ye peoples, from far” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.),</span><span class="font3"> showing that the kingdom message must be carried to faraway peoples, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">witness world-wide. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and willyet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: . . . they shall take them captives, whose captives they were.—Isa. 14:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those faithful at the Lord’s coming to the temple, being loosed from prison or condition of restraint, were brought into the temple and anointed, and the commission was given to them as members of Jehovah’s organization under Christ to “proclaim liberty to the captives”, that is, to others still in captivity. These others would include those later brought into the temple, as well as the “great multitude”. Beginning with 1919, and particularly in 1922, Jehovah, by the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, and through his anointed ones on earth, caused proclamation of “liberty to the captives” to be made. The original faithful remnant share in proclaiming liberty to others, by reason of being a part of “the Servant”, Christ Jesus being the chief one to do this work.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">One from mount Paran. Selah.—Hob. 3:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In days of old Jehovah went forth to vindicate his name by fighting against the enemies of his chosen people. His action then was chiefly to foretell what he will do at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. When he sent Moses to Egypt to make a name for himself, that was temporary, because God’s due time had not arrived to destroy the enemy completely. At Armageddon he will permanently and for ever vindicate his holy name. Habakkuk’s prayersong recounts what Jehovah did in the past, and which foretells what shall come to pass at Armageddon. Jehovah inspired the prayer to 'revive His work at the consummation of the years’. What he did in answer he in times of old fulfilled in miniature, foretelling fu</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">lfillm</span><span class="font3">ent, now in completion.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.—Ps. 106: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only a comparatively few people on earth believe that Jehovah is all-powerful. Others do not know that ‘all power belongs to Jehovah’. (Ps. 62:11) At Armageddon all will be forced to know of his unlimited power. Necessarily vindication of Jehovah’s name involves an exhibition of unlimited power; and thus he will teach all creation that he is the Most High, besides whom there is none. “Behold, God ex-alteth by his power: who teacheth like him?” (Job 36: 22) Salvation is given to man, not because of inherent good qualities of man, but Jehovah has provided salvation for man for His own name’s sake. Satan matches his power against Jehovah’s. Therefore Satan and all his followers must be destroyed. Armageddon is fixed and will accomplish Satan’s destruction and vindication of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">~W 7/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.—2 Pet. 1: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the author of all prophecy. In olden times men who were devoted to Jehovah were permitted to make a record of prophecy and to give utterance to the same, hut no man could ever properly take credit to himself for writing prophecy. The same is true relative to interpretation of prophecy. For this reason no creatures could have an understanding of prophecy until God’s due time to reveal the understanding thereof. When his time comes to unfold his prophecy, he causes those devoted to him to clearly see that all prophecy makes paramount these great truths, to wit: Jehovah’s purpose to vindicate his own holy name, and that he will perform that purpose by and through his beloved loyal and faithful Son, Christ Jesus. Vindication of Jehovah’s name is of first importance, but the salvation of man to life is closely related thereto. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.—Ps. 107: 23,24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present-day “great multitude” or Jonadab class appear to be here represented as doing the shipping. They have been associated with the people alienated from God (“the sea”) and doing their own business, along with others of the commercial element of Satan’s organization. The time arrives when persons of good will learn something about Jehovah’s purposes and his mighty works. This information comes to them by the witnesses whom Jehovah sends out to proclaim the kingdom message. These see Jehovah’s works performed through his faithful witnesses in preaching the gospel of' God’s kingdom and doing so under adverse conditions. Later these see God’s wonderful works at the battle of Armageddon, which will be great tribulation upon “the sea”. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This tribulation does not come for the purpose of developing the great multitude, but is &quot;the great tribulation” (B.V.) that comes upon Satan’s organization, both visible and invisible, and which will completely wreck that entire organization. &quot;The day of Jehovah” began in 1914, at the birth of God’s kingdom. Had that tribulation, then begun, continued to its finality without interruption, all flesh would have been destroyed. The tribulation was shortened by the Lord about the time the World War ended, affording ■opportunity for his witnesses under his co</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font3"> and to go forth and bear testimony to his name and kingdom as a witness to the world. It is during this period of giving testimony or ‘preaching this gospel of the kingdom’ that the &quot;great multitude” come out. The tribulation is not for their benefit.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has laid upon the remnant specific duties and obligations, which are set forth in the commission which God has given to them. They are anointed with the spirit of the Lord and are sent forth to tell the truth, regardless of whether the people hear or refuse to hear. They must make known to the people that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God and that this is the day of his vengeance, that is to say, the time in which he will execute his judgment upon all of Satan’s organization. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah can have nothing in common with the enemy organization, but they must be entirely on the Lord’s side and their challenge to the enemy must be boldly expressed by their constant battle cry, to wit, &quot;For Jehovah and for the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, the Vindicator of the Most High.” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/35</span></p>

The Chaldeans of old were merely instruments of Jehovah to execute his judgment. At Armageddon Christ Jesus will execute Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s forces. The time having come for execution of his judgment against Satan’s host, Christ will go forth to the work. In doing it the Lord asks and receives no dignity. Likewise his followers are in no wise dignified by the enemy. Jehovah’s witnesses, as followers of Christ Jesus, do not apply for permission or a license to be issued by ‘ ‘ Christendom’s ’ ’ officials to do the work with which Jehovah dignifies them.

<p><span class="font3">Be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.—Eph. 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The will of God is the same as his purpose. When his will ■ is expressed, that is the expression of his purpose, decree or determination to do that thing as expressed. Jehovah has a fixed and definite reason for every expression of his will or purpose. There are no idle or superfluous words in his expressed purpose. His will or purpose is his unchangeable law; hence his will is the law or rule of action by which his approved children must be guided. Concerning the unchangeableness of his will he caused his prophet to write: “Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand.” (Isa. 14:24) Under the conditions and circumstances existing today it is of vital importance to every one of Jehovah’s witnesses that he be filled with the knowledge of God’s will.

<p><span class="font3">Clearly the correct meaning of Peter’s words is that the transfiguration vision he witnessed is a corroboration or confirmation of what the prophets of old had written at God’s dictation; and when the time had arrived for fulfillment of that prophetic vision, then would be the time when the prophecies of old written by holy men could be understood. According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font3"> rendering: “We have the word of prophecy made more sure.” Peter’s argument is this: The prophets of old wrote concerning Messiah’s coming in power and glory, but now here is a vision of that glorious coming, and three of us were eyewitnesses to this vision which speaks of the ‘coming of the Lord Jesus in power and glory’. Nothing could add to or take away from the Word of God, but it could be confirmed by the above vision. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/35</span></p>

Those obligating themselves to Satan’s organization by oaths and who have formed alliances with others therein, all which hinders them from freedom in the Lord and his service, are properly said to be “bound”. Until the Lord’s people came to understand what constitutes the “higher powers” (Rom. 13: 1) they were restrained and were bound in fetters. “Them that are bound” certainly included the Ruth and Esther class, which have been brought into Jehovah’s organization from and after 1922. Christ Jesus, the great Judge and Vindicator, has been using the anointed servant class foreshadowed in Mordecai and Naomi to proclaim to others the ‘opening of the prison doors’, and particularly to the Ruth and Esther class. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">God does not prevent Satan and his organization from putting in prison some of God’s faithful people at certain times. The imprisonment of God’s chosen people, natural Israel, by Satan’s organization, foreshadows things to come to pass later relative to his chosen people, spiritual Israel. Joseph was a man of God, and he was caused to be imprisoned in a dungeon. (Gen. 40: 3,15) Joseph was a type of Christ Jesus, and the binding of his feet in fetters of iron would indicate that the feet members of Christ would be restrained or bound or imprisoned. The Scriptural proof shows that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus were in prison, bound and restrained of their liberty when he appeared at the temple in 1918. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

The watching of Habakkuk, who here represents the remnant, applies at the time after the Lord’s coming to the temple and during the time Satan is gathering the whole world against the Lord and his anointed. Satan, having been cast out of heaven, turns over to his prince Gog the work of assembling his forces and forming and executing the conspiracy against God’s hidden ones.

(Prov. 15: 3) Hence the remnant now, anxious to see the name of almighty God vindicated and the wicked destroyed, ask the question. “Christendom” has dealt treacherously against Jehovah by becoming part of Satan’s organization. She now enters into a conspiracy against the Lord and his people, and- expects to get away with it; but her treachery is exposed. God’s remnant are “more righteous”, but not “holier than thou”, in justification of self; for, judging each side by their fruits, the remnant know that “Christendom” stands for and holds forth the Devil’s message, while the remnant hold forth the kingdom fruits and are on the right side. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">That same ‘elect servant’ is the Vindicator of Jehovah, his word and his name. It is the exalted Servant of Jehovah that is blind, and, says the Lord, 'there is none as blind as that servant.’ Why? Because he has but one purpose, and his eyes are closed to everything else. That purpose is to always do the will of Jehovah. Nothing can cause him to deviate therefrom in the slightest. Of him it is written: “I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” Those who are faithful and true to Jehovah are blind to everything that is contrary to God’s will. Every one who becomes a member of God’s royal house is thereby made a member of the 'elect servant’ class of Jehovah and therefore must follow in Jesus’ footsteps. Like Jesus, all such must be blind to everything save doing the will of Almighty God. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Israelites on the trek from Egypt to the Promised Land pictured God’s covenant people on the way to the kingdom. Op the plains of Moab God made with them the covenant of faithfulness. Jehovah approves and receives into his royal organization only those who under test remain true and faithful to him. Such must maintain their integrity to God to the end. From the time that Jehovah first declared his purpose to have a righteous government on earth until the present time the question before men has been, Who will maintain their integrity toward God? Everyone whom God will have in his royal house will be a monument or memorial testifying to the fact that Satan is a liar and that Jehovah is true. They must undergo a proving test to reach this point. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Wisdom means the receiving of knowledge into a good and honest mind and that then the creature moved by a pure heart or motive pursues a course of action in harmony with the knowledge of the truth. One may gather together in an abstract manner the facts as stated in the text of the Bible, and be able to repeat the text without hesitation, and at the same time have no spiritual discernment thereof and be entirely void of wisdom. There must be a proper appreciation of the true relationship of the creature to the infinite Creator before one can have wisdom. Hence it is written that a man should not think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but that he should think soberly and with faith in God. One who thinks too highly of himself is never able to succeed in accomplishing a good thing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The clear implication is that when that time arrives for Jehovah’s anointed to understand the vision, it will be made so plain to them that there could be no doubt about it. Now we know that no man can get a clear understanding of God’s purpose until God’s due time. The record thereof must be a permanent one and preserved for the time of the fall of hypocritical &quot;Christendom”. The vision is not given to be kept secret, but must be told to others and printed and published in plain, readable style. In due time Jehovah began to make clear to his faithful on earth that the vindication of His name is of paramount importance. These things have been made plain, not by the ability or work of man, but because Jehovah caused events to come to pass in fulfillment of his prophecies long ago written.

The faithful remnant are not idle, but continue with diligence in their work. The fruits of the kingdom, with which God through Christ Jesus has so graciously blessed them, they joyfully bear to others, that the name of Jehovah may be known among the people. Those found faithful at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, and who therefore form the original ones of the “faithful servant” class, continuing actively in obedience to the Lord’s commandments are blessed with the privilege of bearing the fruit of the kingdom to others who are brought into the fold, and the number of the servant class is increased.

It is a psalm or song of ecstasy which rises to the heights of rapture, as Jehovah gave Habakkuk a vision of what was to come to pass. An understanding now of tha^ vision enraptures those who see what is just at hand. Habakkuk on watch had heard what God had to say to him and why Jehovah had permitted the acts of the wicked, and what He did to them. Now he prays Jehovah to bring to pass his judgments heretofore written. Likewise the remnant standing on watch have heard why Jehovah has permitted them to suffer at the enemy’s hands.

Hence its true Tnp.aning and importance would appear to God’s people only in his due time to interpret the same and make it plain. This is one of Jehovah’s secrets which belongs to him until he makes it known to his children in his own due time. (Deut. 29: 29) He does not reveal his secrets to rebellious ones, but only to those devoted to him, and then to them only in his due time. “For the froward is abomination to the Lord; but his secret is with the righteous.” (Prov. 3: 32) That which the prophetic transfiguration magnifies as of greatest importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through his beloved Son, Christ Jesus.

This gospel has also been preached to the people of good will according to the Lord’s command. It is those that hear, understand and respond to the gospel message by consecrating themselves to do God’s will, and then seek meekness and righteousness, that receive his approval and blessing.

In the past God’s covenant people have held to some doctrines or practices ignorantly, by reason whereof they have been greatly restrained and have not had and exercised full liberty in their efforts to serve God. Those in a covenant with God are bound to him; but when the enemy came against them by force, they, out of fear of the enemy, failed to do their duty, and fell into Satan’s snare. Hence Jehovah permitted them to be taken prisoners. These coming to realize their restrained condition and why they were thus bound and in prison, and then turning with their full devotion to Jehovah and seeking and looking for deliverance by him, Jehovah hears their cries and delivers them.

Vessels of dishonor are marked by the Lord for destruction. Vessels of mercy are the ones upon whom God makes known the riches of his glory. If a vessel is marked for destruction, surely it could not be classed as one of less honor, receiving a secondary reward in heaven.

Whenever the Devil sees a man faithfully performing service to God, he is certain to launch against that man some scandalous lie to enable others to say, in substance: “God would not use that sort of man, against whom such charges are made. Therefore such is proof that he is not God’s servant.” But God judges his own servants. The servant need not be concerned at the adverse judgment of imperfect creatures.

For that reason, it is written concerning the beloved Son: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Vss. 8, 9) Jesus did not make himself a candidate for this high office, but Jehovah called him to the exalted position and made him High Priest to ever carry out Jehovah’s purpose.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet did see. 0 Jehovah, how long shall I cry?~Hdb. 1:1,2, A.R.V., mar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name &quot;Habakkuk” means &quot;clasper”, that is, clasper of the hands or in embrace; or love’s &quot;embrace”. As at Canticles 2: 6: &quot;His right hand doth embrace me.” Now the Lord Jesus has returned and gathered his own unto himself at the temple of Jehovah. Therefore the remnant have come into the Lord Jesus’ embrace. This is for their safety and comfort. The holy spirit’s advocacy and comfort are now ceased, because Christ Jesus himself is with his own and he is the comforter. Now God’s remnant have come to unity. They see they must stand together. All the faithful do stand firmly as one man, proclaiming the truth in love. This unity in Christ is the blessed condition in which they now find themselves. In this blessed state the Lord feeds them upon spiritual food convenient for them. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah rewards those who diligently seek to know his purpose and to obey his commandments. His faithful remnant apply themselves that they may gain a knowledge of his will in wisdom and spiritual understanding. They study to show themselves approved unto God, and look not to any creature for guidance and strength. “Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust; and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.” (Ps. 40: 4, 16) Those who do not believe that the Lord Jesus is at the temple of Jehovah find no consolation in these texts. Those who are in the temple and who are diligent to learn will receive a knowledge of Jehovah’s purpose, that they may freely and boldly declare it to others.

<p><span class="font3">This law or rule of action applies to every creature to whom Jehovah will give life everlasting. From Abel to John Jehovah approved a few men, and the reason for his approval of such men was that they maintained their integrity toward him. This they did by showing their love for him, and their love for him was shown by their obedience to his commandments, and thus they showed their absolute faith in Jehovah God. Those to whom Jehovah gives life as members of his royal house are required to measure up to the same rule or standard and by their course of action prove their love and devotion to Jehovah. Surely there is required the same degree of faithfulness on the part of every creature who lives. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/35</span></p>

They are determined to prove their integrity to Jehovah under all conditions. Satan and his agents may put restraint upon the organization made up of Jehovah’s witnesses, but no longer can Satan and his wicked agents at all hold their minds and heart devotion to the Lord in any wise in restraint. Even though thrown into literal prisons, they continue to preach the kingdom gospel and, when released, they will not slack their hand, but go on regardless of what Satan may do.

<p><span class="font3">The “fatness of the olive tree” is a symbol of joy, and the joy of the Lord Jesus is to exalt and vindicate Jehovah’s name. God’s remnant, by entering into the “joy of the Lord”, do “honour God and man”. They shine forth as lights in the world to God’s glory. Their shining is not because of their inherent brightness, but because the glory of Jehovah has risen upon them, and his light is seen upon them. For Jehovah’s witnesses to join in the reign with Satan’s organization would be to dishonor Jehovah’s holy name. The faithful remnant refuse to have anything to do with politics or political affairs of this world. They do not honor men of the earth, but do honor “the man Christ Jesus”, whom Jehovah has crowned with glory and honor. TV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/35</span></p>

The climax of filling the clergy and their allies brimful with shame and contempt is yet future, and that will be done by the hand of Christ Jesus. He will make these “roosters” appear ridiculous and shameful. He hands the cup to those deserving it. In due time it will come around to each and every one of the ruling element that has indulged in oppressive practices upon the people, and particularly upon Jehovah’s witnesses.

Because he gave his Word and oaths to do these things, his remnant, whom Habakkuk foreshadowed, utter the prophetic prayer of Habakkuk and sing to Jehovah, now saying: “Revive thy work in the midst of the years”; and thus they show their complete confidence in and reliance upon the Word of the Most High. The faithful are meek, because they are diligent in seeking to understand Jehovah’s purposes and hasten to obey his will.

The salvation of man became secondary in importance. To decide the issue in God’s favor, at least one man must prove his absolute devotion to Jehovah, being obedient under all conditions and remaining true and faithful to God. The man Jesus met every requirement under the test, proving his faithfulness to Jehovah, even enduring an ignominious death. Because of his faithfulness Jehovah raised Jesus out of death and made him the author of eternal salvation for all men who would follow in Jesus’ footsteps and who would prove their devotion to God.

His kingdom company has been gathered during a period of nineteen centuries, and, taken as a whole, the Lord Jesus designates them as a “little flock” to whom Jehovah gives the kingdom. At no time has there been a great multitude in line for the kingdom, and who were at one time on the earth. The “great multitude” are not a spirit-begotten company, that is, never brought forth and acknowledged by Jehovah as his spiritual sons.

As God’s faithful children they continued to pray or cry unto Jehovah. It was in 1918 that Jehovah began to build up Zion by resurrecting the faithful who had died and bringing them into his spiritual temple, and also by bringing the faithful remnant on earth unto himself in the temple. “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.” (Ps. 102: 16,17) The facts show that God brought them out of prison or the condition of restraint when Zion was built up.

<p><span class="font3">During that period the elect have a work to do as witnesses for Jehovah, under his commandment. At least a part of that work is the marking of the great multitude in their foreheads, as commanded at Ezekiel 9: 4. That means that Jehovah’s witnesses must proclaim the message of truth and thus give an intellectual understanding thereof to those of the great multitude class, which class “flee into the mountains”, taking their place and stand in the “city of refuge”. This is “immediately after the tribulation of those days”, that is, after the first part of the tribulation, from 1914 to 1918.

Before the ancient Israelites could be released from Egypt there must be shed the blood of the lamb foretelling the shed blood of Christ Jesus the Lamb of God. The first law covenant was inaugurated with blood; and so it must be that the new covenant is inaugurated with blood.

Love for God means to obey his commandments, joyfully. During the Elijah period those professed servants of God who did according to their own wish, to avoid reproach, were not moved so to do by love; hence they did not have a pure heart.

During the Elijah period God’s faithful servants themselves did not clearly understand just why the Lord gave them their strength, although they knew they were on his side and their strength came by his grace.

The climax of “the years” was reached in 1914. There Satan’s world ended and Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful King, was enthroned. The tribulation upon the world there began. At Armageddon it will end in such a spectacular demonstration of power that all will know that it is Jehovah’s mighty hand that accomplishes these things.

After Armageddon they must come over the highway to Zion, and as they come they must sing Jehovah’s praises to those of mankind w*ho will then be awakened out of death. The “elders” are the company of Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom some will be on earth after Armageddon. (Rev. 4: 4) After Armageddon the great multitude or Jonadab company will continue the song of praise to Jehovah, together with those of Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth, and after his witnesses are removed from the earth the great multitude will continue to praise Jehovah with songs of deliverance.

<p><span class="font3">Habaklnlk began his song with the words “0 Lord, I have heard thy speech”. After receiving the vision of the universal war he says it greatly shook and disturbed him. The vision of Armageddon now had by God’s remnant, as revealed to them by him, is awesome and terrible. They cannot tell it out to others except by God’s grace. They tremble, not, however, because of what the enemy does or threatens to do, but because of the fearful prospect that is just before of what God will do upon the earth at Armageddon, the terrible execution of his judgments upon the stubborn ones. It requires a heart and -mind strong of faith in Jehovah to not shrink back from the fearful days just ahead, but Jehovah gives his people strength to continue boldly onward.

<p><span class="font3">The followers of Christ Jesus must have some knowledge as a basis for faith. Until God’s' due time to give them an understanding of the meaning of prophecy they must keep in mind God’s law and prophecies, including Jesus’ transfiguration scene. Peter did not expect prophecy to be understood in his day, nor during the life of the men who lived at that time, but that the Word of prophecy and corroborative testimony concerning the same, given by the prophetic transfiguration vision, would be to the followers of Christ Jesus as a light in a dark place shining for their guidance, and that this condition of little light would continue “until the day dawn’’, at which time there would be a change and hence greater light and clearer understanding.

<p><span class="font3">The lion was sent there by the Devil, and the purpose was to destroy Samson because he was seeking an occasion against the Devil’s representatives on earth. That “young lion” pictured the clergy of the so-called “Protestant” organizations that bitterly and with great noise opposed the work of God’s people during the Elijah period, when Christ Jesus was preparing the way before Jehovah. Proclamation of the truth caused alarm in Satan’s camp, and occasion was taken to frighten Christ’s followers into silence and bring about their destruction. The Protestant system, at the beginning a “lion” of justice, had now become a representative of the Devil and hence a devouring lion like its father, going about seeking whom it might devour and bent on keeping the people in ignorance of the Scripturbs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jesus did not say his faithful followers should hide out when persecuted, but he told them that they should go on in giving the testimony. The apostles and those immediately associated with them could not complete the testimony before the Lord’s coming, because they lived only a few years. Hence Jesus said: “When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.” (Vs. 23) But how shall Jehovah’s witnesses now act? When persecuted in one place, shall they flee to another to avoid persecution? No; because Christ has now come, taken his authority and gathered the temple class and instructed them and sent them forth as his witnesses. They must finish the testimony, hence boldly continue to bear witness, trusting in the Lord to deliver them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Habakkuk in this prophecy represented the faithful remnant now on the earth. The cry is for Jehovah to clear his name by establishing righteous conditions on earth in place of oppressive, cruel and lawless conditions which now interfere with the free course of the truth. The crying is apparently in vain and without being heard for a time, which shows that the enemies are for some time permitted to keep up hostilities against the remnant without interference from Jehovah. Is it wrong or showing lack of faith for them to have asked such questions or to make such observations? The answer must be, It is not wrong nor even improper, for the reason that God foretold that his faithful ones would utter such cries to him and that he would comfort their hearts by increasing their knowledge. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/35</span></p>

Faith, or faithfulness, means that one maintains his integrity toward Jehovah, refusing to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, and exercising diligence in learning God’s will and then joyfully obeying his commandments. The faithful remnant gladly feed upon the food Jehovah has graciously provided for them, and they grow in strength, regardless of all persecution that the enemy may heap upon the faithful as they go on proclaiming the message of Jehovah’s name and kingdom.

Now the great multitude of the present day cries out: ‘Salvation is come; save now, send us prosperity.’ They attribute the work of God’s salvation or vindication unto his great Vindicator, Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, and that their own salvation is from Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus, and not from any other source. The “great multitude” is made up of human creatures who hear, accept and rejoice in God’s kingdom under Christ. They openly confess that they are on the Lord’s side.

The same rule must be obeyed by the great multitude, because they have become a part of God’s organization. They must come to Zion, God’s temple, and worship there, and not at any worldly organization called “the church’’. Jehovah’s temple is not anywhere in Satan’s organization. Therefore they must flee out of “Babylon’’, Satan’s organization, and must boldly take their stand on the Lord’s side and associate themselves with God’s anointed people. “In his temple,” where the great multitude serve God (Rev. 7: 15), does not mean the temple’s inner court, because such inner court is exclusively for Jehovah’s priestly class; but they are separated to the “outer court” and there serve him continuously. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Oil being a symbol of joy and gladness resulting from loving devotion to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, this would mean that the foolish were selfish, did not have love for God and Christ Jesus, and were such as have not “the joy of the Lord”. They were looking for the coming of Christ Jesus, not that Jehovah’s name might be honored and glorified, but that they as creatures might be ekalted to a high position. There was no joy in their hearts, as indeed there cannot be in an extremely selfish heart. The wise had the joy of the Lord in them; it was their strength.

It means to know God’s purpose and then to be faithful in performing the commission and obligation laid upon his witnesses. To be “fruitful in every good work’’ means to be bearers of the fruit of God’s kingdom, which fruit is the message of truth concerning the kingdom. This he has committed to his witnesses. This life-giving and life-sustaining message of truth they must carry to others; and in doing this such witnesses increase in the knowledge of God. The greatest privilege ever accorded to a creature is that of serving Jehovah God.

Samson was commissioned to bring a calamity or evil destruction upon the Philistines. Therefore in what he did he was blameless. Likewise during the Elijah period God’s servants were used to bring evil upon modern Philistines by proclaiming the truth, because God’s Word of truth is sharper than a two-edged sword. Wielding that sword “shocks the religious susceptibilities” of the hypocritical crowd and ‘burns their pastures’. Proclamation of the truth has inflicted much punishment upon modern Philistines.

Hypocritical Christians, including the “man of sin”, have repeatedly insisted that Jehovah’s witnesses should say nothing about the commercial and political elements of this world, because, say they, such elements constitute the higher powers that rule and to such higher powers all should be subject. In that, as in all other matters, they are wrong. Here is a prophetic picture showing that God’s remnant must cry out to those who have set up the “abomination of desolation” in the place of God’s kingdom, and must sound warning to the people, telling them the facts, that they might flee to safety.

<p><span class="font3">The Hierarchy expects to shortly rid earth of these &quot;pestiferous” witnesses, and says in effect: &quot;This crowd of Jehovah’s witnesses will not last long.” However, when Jehovah rises up as he did at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon and brings about the downfall of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that will be so wonderful, unusual, tremendous and foreign to what has ever before come to pass, that millions of adherents of the Hierarchy will exclaim: &quot;How strange that God should destroy that organization!” They will see that the work is not of man but must be the work of the Almighty; and it is to such that this work will seem &quot;strange”.

By studying prophecy, together with the well known physical facts, all the meek may readily see and understand the present-day conditions and know that Armageddon is near. Those who do read and understand are obligated to run with haste and tell others about it. When the vision appears, then it is the privilege of those who see to hasten and give others opportunity to hear and understand and thus to publish Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font3">To be strong in the Lord one must be strong in faith. One larking a knowledge and understanding does not possess the basis for strength of faith, because faith comes by receiving understanding of the Word of God. When faith is weak hope grows dim and doubts crowd in. To some of the consecrated it may seem a long time since the Lord’s coming to the temple; and since persecution by the enemy continues against them, those of less faith begin to doubt and to make inquiry. But Jehovah will destroy the wicked by the army of Christ, and this He will do in his own due time. The opposing armies are lining up for the war.

<p><span class="font3">The fact that they “stood” shows that they are approved by the Most High, because “the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”. (Ps. 1: 5) Stand where? Would the “great multitude” have to go to heaven in order to stand approved before the Lord? Certainly not; nor would they have to be in heaven in order to stand “before the throne”, even in reference to position. In 1914 Jehovah put his beloved Son on the throne of authority. In 1918 Christ Jesus began judgment at the temple. In standing before him for judgment the “great multitude” need not be in heaven, for Jesus stated that when he assumes his throne all nations shall be gathered before him, and surely these nations are not in heaven.

Seeing and appreciating these things, they are determined that no amount of opposition or persecution shall deter them in faithfully performing their assigned duty. Let the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all others of Satan’s wicked crowd do what they will. By Jehovah’s grace his faithful witnesses will continue to sing forth the praises of the Most High. Increased responsibility also comes upon the Jonadabs as they come to see and understand the truth. They must see to it that they prove themselves faithful and true to the Lord and do with their might what their hands find to do. Such is a condition precedent to being of the great multitude.

His breaking forth there was like waters breaking their bounds and rushing like a torrent to destroy everything in their way. This same place is mentioned in Isaiah 28: 21 and there called ‘‘mount Perazim”; therefore the prophecy definitely fixes the battle illustrating the destruction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.

The World War experience of the “faithful servant” class was at least a part of these “wilderness” experiences of those who were “redeemed from the hand of the enemy”. (Vss. 2,7) It is this remnant in the flesh, here called “the children of men”, that appreciate God’s goodness to them and that praise the Lord “for his wonderful works to the children of men”. “For he {Jehovah] satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.” (Vs. 9) God has satisfied them with a vision of his glory at the temple.—Ps. 17: 15.

The released ones are permitted to serve and praise him. The Jonadabs hear the testimony of the anointed witness class and join themselves to Jehovah’s organization and participate in the songs of his praise. Jehovah, by his elect servant, brings the prisoners out of the prison house. This releasing of prisoners is done in a time of controversy or a fight, when the Devil is resisting with all his power, and therefore Jehovah supports his “faithful servant” class and safely keeps them in the hollow of his hand.

This commandment is not at all discretionary, but is absolutely mandatory. The obligation is laid upon the anointed remnant, Jehovah’s witnesses, to participate in presenting to the honest people the truth concerning God’s kingdom. This work they must do before Armageddon. It is the truth that serves to open the doors to them that are bound, that they may willingly and intelligently go free.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus has some other sheep, and now these he brings forth and permits them to associate with and serve as companions of the little flock on earth. All being under leadership of the “good Shepherd”, and all of God’s organization, they are “one flock”. The great multitude were once prisoners, but now are being set free and brought into the Lord’s organization. It is the faithful remnant’s privilege to bear the fruits of the kingdom to those who come forth and form the great multitude, and these latter as they come forth and enter God’s organization have the privilege and duty to serve as companions to the faithful remnant. Therefore at all service conventions and service meetings the Jonadabs should actively engage with the remnant in bearing the testimony to the people of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font3">This proves that God’s woman, his organization, gives birth only to those who are completely separated from the world and devoted to Jehovah. They have no alternative. Their devotion to God must be complete and an absolute and complete separation from the world to God, and this must be accomplished before they are brought forth as the sons of God. “All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” All who are taught of God must be wholly separated to him; otherwise they would not be taught of the Lord. The fact that Samson could not have his hair cut without losing Jehovah’s favor shows that children of God’s woman cannot partially devote themselves to him but must be entirely and wholly devoted to him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W11/1/35</span></p>

The vine produces good wine, which is a symbol of joy: &quot;For the joy [of wine] of the Lord is your strength.” Following the World War &quot;Christendom” invites Christ to be her ruler upon her own terms and purely for a selfish purpose. She and her chief men would deny Christ and his faithful remnant-members of his house the privilege and joy of proclaiming the name of Jehovah God. She would prevent them from giving honor and joyful praise by proclaiming Jehovah's name and from thus having part in vindicating his name. Could the royal house of Jehovah agree to any such terms?

<p><span class="font3">The issue raised by the Devil made it necessary and important that God permit him to use his devices in an effort to turn men away from faithful devotion to the Most High. Hence Jesus was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness. In that temptation Jesus won. All members of the royal house must follow in his steps and must likewise be subjected to temptations or tests. To tempt means to entice; to discipline, and to prove. How could one be proved unless subjected to enticement or temptation? When put to test as to whether they will be true to God or not, the faithful will remain true and steadfast in faithful devotion to him.

This is another proof that some of God’s remnant will pass alive through Armageddon, when the nations shall be destroyed. When Gog's forces threaten to overwhelm Jehovah’s people they will stand their ground and wholly trust in him, and maintain integrity toward him, and God will bring them through the great battle conditions.

But no one could fully understand these prophecies until the coming of the Lord Jesus and the beginning of the kingdom, and then only a few have believed since his coming and his appearing at the temple for judgment. Many have persuaded themselves to believe that God’s Word was given for their own special benefit and God has laid on them the obligation to interpret and use prophecy; and then they felt free to use it according to their own ideas.

<p><span class="font3">A workman that is ashamed cannot be bold in this day of judgment in declaring the truth as God has commanded his witnesses to do. He must grow in a knowledge of present-day truth with wisdom and spiritual understanding in order to be strong in the Lord and the power of his might and in order to be a true witness to Jehovah’s name. To ‘rightly divide the truth’ means to have a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes as disclosed by his prophecies, the meaning of which is now unfolded by the Lord to his people. One who studies to show himself approved to God is not meditating on how wonderful and beautiful he is within himself, but is gaining knowledge of God’s expressed will and receiving that knowledge in wisdom and spiritual understanding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah shows that he will speak and give his reason for permitting the wicked to continue their iniquitous work. The crucial hour has come, and it is only the Lord who can give complete peace and strength to his people. They get up into the siege tower to see what? Manifestly to see the movement of Jehovah’s host against the doomed “Christendom” and to get a clearer vision and to cry out to those below, and particularly to those of good will known as Jona-dabs. Habakkuk’s language is symbolic, of course, and the siege tower pictures the remnant uplifted and in a heavenly position. Jehovah speaks to them by his prophecies and thus gives them flashes of lightning, revealing to them what is written in His Word for their comfort and hope.

<p><span class="font3">On his triumphant march from Mount Sinai to Jerusalem God led his people through the land of Teman. “Lord, when thou wentegt out of Seir [of which Teman is a part], when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom [to which Teman belonged], the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped [waters], the clouds also dropped water.” (Judg. 5: 4, 5) “Paran” means “beautiful, gleaming”. Jehovah in his conquering march to the battle of Armageddon comes from the highest place, illustrated by the mountains, but far more lofty and beautiful than Mount Paran. God led the Israelites from Sinai to the north by Moses’ hand. Now he leads his mighty hosts by the hand of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, approaching as “from the south” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)</span><span class="font3"> to engage in the great battle. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Continued persecution, arrests, imprisonment and ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Devil’s representatives would tend to make weary and faint the strongest ones if they were not permitted to receive a knowledge and understanding as to the reason for such persecutions. But since Jehovah has opened his prophecies and makes clear to them the reason, his faithful witnesses are glad to be permitted to have part in the sufferings that came upon Christ. To maintain his integrity Christ Jesus suffered, and was made perfect. Likewise the faithful remnant must suffer persecution and be faithful in order to maintain their integrity. By God’s grace they will not become weary and faint.—Gal. 6: 9. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Manifestly the words “until the day dawn” mean the beginning of the “day of Jehovah”, which had its beginning when Jehovah placed his King upon his throne in Zion, in 1914, and when he was sent forth to rule. God had given his word to send his King in due time, and his followers were to look forward to the kingdom and hold firmly to their hope which God had set before them, and they must keep themselves separate and distinct from the wicked world. If they should become negligent and indifferent they would become blind and not see afar off concerning the coming of the King and his kingdom. When the “day of Jehovah” should arrive, would all see clearly? Not all who had once believed, but only those whose heart devotion is to God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ sits in the throne with Jehovah, that is, as the special Judge who renders judgment at Jehovah’s throne. (Rev. 3: 21) It is those on earth of good will, who take the side of the Lord and become his “sheep”, that stand before him the great Judge as approved. To these “sheep” Christ Jesus says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” These are the ones that get life eternal, on earth. While being judged, they are on earth, but ‘in the sight of’ Christ Jesus, because now he is giving attention to them, although no human eyes can see him. The great multitude learn he is at the temple, on his judgment throne. They discern this truth though not seeing him with natural eyes. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Thus is foretold of the overflowing and victorious armies of Jehovah under the leadership of Christ Jesus that flow by and overflow and destroy the enemy. “The deep” contains the thought of a “roaring” abyss of waters. The picture is one of roaring and high waves, denoting either very high winds or undersea earthquakes causing a tidal wave. Such a thing on a far more tremendous scale must come to pass at Armageddon. Such would cause the deepest part of the sea to be greatly disturbed. This would indicate that the people who are most completely alienated from God by reason of the Devil’s influence will at Armageddon be terribly shaken. In the midst of all that storm, earthquake, trembling and tumult, God’s faithful remnant will be safe, and Jehovah will preserve them from it all.—Ps. 46: 1-3.

<p><span class="font3">At this point Samson pictures those who began to deliver God’s people from the antitypieal Philistines and who did so by faithfully declaring God’s Word and making known God’s power and great name. The work of complete deliverance of Israel from the Philistines was performed by David particularly in the two great battles, one at Mount Perazim and the other at Gibeon, to which Jehovah by his prophet refers, and which foreshadows the greater deliverance to be accomplished by Christ Jesus, the great antitypical David. In harmony with this Christ Jesus from about 1878 began to prepare the way before Jehovah, and sent forth his faithful followers from then on to declare Jehovah’s purpose to oust all his enemies and to set up his kingdom.

<p><span class="font3">When God’s people were oppressed many fell away; therefore the number was diminished. (Vs. 39) There were those in line for the kingdom, including “elective elders”, who became lawless and formed the “evil servant” class. These, together with the arrogant clergy, and all would-be leaders of “Christendom”, came in for judgment. All such self-important ones are styled as &quot;nobles” or “princes”. Sueh became like the scapegoat, which was led away into the wilderness. (Lev. 16: 8, 20-22) In the final tribulation such will find no way of escape. Jehovah’s remnant are poor in spirit and poor in their own estimation, relying wholly upon the Lord. Such humble themselves under his mighty hand.

These foolish ones would get some joy out of being flattered and patted on the back and put in positions of honor among men, to show themselves as important. If they could receive that much, it would encourage them to continue in the company of the wise. They were not willing to come along and bear the reproaches that were upon the wise and do the menial service.

<p><span class="font3">During the Elijah period of the church some .who afterwards formed the “faithful servant” class boldly spoke the truth concerning illicit relationship between professed Christians and political elements who pretended to serve God but in fact served the Devil. These faithful ones were objects of criticism by the class represented by the Philistine woman, Samson’s prospective wife. She employed feigned affection and sentimentality to prevent the spoiling of Jehovah’s enemies. The fact that Samson had not told her concerning the secret of the riddle shows that the true followers of Christ Jesus put Jehovah and his organization above all things of the world. Therefore Samson’s remarks to “his wife” picture these faithful ones’ standing out for that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord.—Judg. 14: 16.

Such are the ones that Jehovah has brought out of prisons or a restraint and built up into Zion. They were in restraint or imprisoned by Satan’s organization, particularly during the World War period. Now the remnant are in greater danger of death at the hand of the enemy, but they confidently rely upon Jehovah and Christ Jesus and by the grace and the strength of the Lord they go on in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom.

Anyone not having full confidence and faith in God and his promises would not dare tell the truth about the organization of the Hierarchy. But the faithful have taken their stand wholly on the Lord’s side and Him they will serve, and not man. They know their God will intervene in their behalf. They know that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the Devil’s chief visible agent on earth and that God will search out and destroy all his enemies, including the Hierarchy. With this knowledge and assurance from God’s Word, the faithful pray God to hasten the day when the enemy shall perish from the earth, and they continue with joyful words to sing Jehovah’s praises, knowing that the enemy can do nothing worse than to kill them.

God’s faithful servant class may confidently rely on Jehovah to sustain them in every time of need and that he will never forsake those who continue faithful in performing their covenant to do his will. When the conflict was trying and the faithful became tired, worn and thirsty for some refreshing assurance from the Lord, he provided it, and on they went with their work and continued to rejoice. This exactly accords with God’s promise to those faithful to him. (Isa. 40: 29-31) What God does to one faithful servant, he does likewise to all faithful to him.

Concerning Jesus it is written: &quot;The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” Like reproaches fall upon his followers.

<p><span class="font3">The “vision”, which is given to the prophet and now to the remnant, is of the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which battle will be fought for the purpose of vindicating Jehovah’s name; and hence it is for a definitely appointed time.

The vision “hasteth toward the end”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> This suggests that not only is the time definitely fixed, but the time is short and Jehovah’s witnesses must make haste to do the work the Lord has given them to do.

Samson appears now to be stronger than ever before, and surely after 1918 God’s faithful people on earth were, and since have been, stronger than ever before, “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,” faithfully declaring his message. While grinding in prison Samson would be considering how he could fulfill his commission from God. During the restraint of the Samson class they were praying to God and meditating how again to be of greater service to Jehovah than ever before.

(Joel 3: 14,15) At Armageddon Jehovah’s forces will not need to depend upon the light of the sun or of the moon or of the stars.

It is the judgment throne of Jehovah, and there is seated Christ Jesus as presiding Justice to render judgment. The “four and twenty elders” include all who are able ministers of God’s new covenant (2 Cor. 3: 6), and this includes Jehovah’s witnesses, because these have been brought to maturity in Christ and have become elders in fact.

Now the “great multitude”, the “other sheep” mentioned by Jesus, that is, the Jonadabs, are invited and are brought into the organization or the flock of the Lord. Comparatively few people see and appreciate God’s dealings with his own people at the present time.

The fact that the command is given to loose them shows that up to a time certain they have been bound. The “four angels” or commissioned messengers are all of Jehovah’s witnesses anointed and commissioned and commanded by. him to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth. These witnesses must first be loosed from restraint and then be “prepared” and equipped for the work assigned to them.

In making sport of Samson the Philistines reproached Jehovah’s name and praised the Devil through their god Dagon. In modern times the modern Philistines, making sport of Jehovah’s ■witnesses, have brazenly reproached his name and given praise to the Devil and his organization. “Who is blind, but my servant?” says the Lord.

The Philistines were in the land before God’s chosen people arrived in Canaan. Likewise the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, occupied the place or condition claimed by them as a divine provision for that organization, before the anointed ones are taken out of the world and anointed of the Lord. Jehovah permitted this in order that he might prove that his people love God and prove it by unselfish obedience to his commandments under stress.

To his sealed remnant Jehovah now says in substance: ‘You are commissioned to proclaim the day of God’s vengeance. You are commissioned as trees of God’s planting to give this witness, that you may be trees of righteousness to the glory of the Most High.’ No creature ever enjoyed such a privilege as this. Every true and faithful one of the remnant will now joyfully say, We are for Jehovah and for the Greater Gideon, his Vindicator. Each one now will be able to meet the test only if he, like trees planted by the waters, reaches down deeply and drinks of the truth and then faithfully, unhesitatingly, boldly and fearlessly declares the truth.

Instead of permitting his &quot;hidden ones” to remain in perplexity and doubt as to the reason for the violence heaped upon them, God has made it known to them that the old Dragon, Satan, not only is active but is putting forth his strongest efforts to destroy those who give the testimony of Jesus Christ in obedience to God’s commandments, that the enemies of God’s people are numerous and are made up of a host of wicked angels and the clergy and &quot;the man of sin” and other dupes, who do Satan’s bidding, and that this multitude of enemies will continue to assault Jehovah’s witnesses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">One who fears God fears to do any injury to his brethren and puts away from him pride and arro-ganey, regarding these as deadly enemies. If one thinks of himself as of more than ordinary importance, and that he should lord it over and browbeat his brethren, then he does not have the fear of God in his heart. One who is arrogant or proud and haughty, and hence without fear of God, is in very grave danger. The wise person fears pride, arrogancy and an injurious way, because such are contrary to God’s law; hence the wise person fears God, and this is the beginning of wisdom. To increase in wisdom he must always fear to displease God or to think of himself as of great importance. He must remember what God requires of those he approves.

Tents would denote the dwelling place of the warriors. At Armageddon the forces of Gog shall be in great affliction.

He says nothing about development of character that would qualify anyone to help the Lord rule the universe.

<p><span class="font3">It is the desire that Jehovah’s witnesses he filled with the knowledge of God’s will. Knowledge, within the meaning of this text, does not consist merely in a mental putting together of certain facts, hut it does mean that facts or truths as expressed in God’s Word are collected and put together in wisdom and understanding. Knowledge of the truth means clear perception of the truth. A knowledge of God’s will means a clear perception of what God has expressed in his Word concerning his purpose as the same is related to his chosen people. Knowledge in “wisdom and spiritual understanding’’ means that a knowledge of the truth is received and accompanied by thorough or true wisdom and discernment of spiritual things. Spiritual things can be discerned only by those who have devoted themselves to God. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The house represented Satan’s visible organization, in which his devotees feast and praise his name and curse Jehovah. The two supporting pillars thereof are (1) that the visible ruling powers, the ones to be praised, are religionists, controllers of commerce, and political instruments, and that these constitute the “higher powers”, to which all must he subject, regardless of what God may say; (2) that such “higher powers” or visible ruling factors are the ones endowed and empowered and ably qualified to give the people prosperity, security and peace -on earth; and that these two “pillars” will robe earth in glory and beauty. For some time now the Samson class, God’s faithful witnesses on earth, have been placed between these two “pillars”. They now clearly discern that these “pillars” are false.

<p><span class="font3">Now Jehovah’s remnant have learned that he permits the enemy to continue to persecute the remnant in order that they may have an opportunity to maintain their integrity toward God and in order that the acts of the enemies may be testimony against themselves. Then Jehovah shows his people that soon he will march through the land and destroy the enemy forces and completely vindicate his own great name. The vision of that battle of Armageddon was given to Habakkuk. The remnant now are permitted by faith to see something of the manner in which it will be conducted. It will be far too stupendous, aweinspiring and overwhelming for any human language to now describe it. The remnant by faith see what is coming within a short time, and knowing that it means Jehovah’s vindication and their own deliverance, they break forth in song.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus had been sent by his Father to earth to do his Father’s will, and Jesus had been wholly obedient to his Father. Jesus declared he was sent to bear witness to the truth, and his faithfulness in performing his commission earned for him the title “The Faithful and True Witness”. The words which the three witnesses heard from the cloud disclosed the necessity for them to be likewise obedient to God and, since Jesus spoke with authority, that whatsoever he commanded they must obey. This fixes the rule that all followers of Jesus must obey his commandments. Obedience is one of the fixed rules of Jehovah. There is no deviation therefrom permitted. God’s inflexible rule concerning his creatures was long ago announced: &quot;Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Since the Lord’s coming to the temple Jehovah’s witnesses have been privileged to carry to. the hungry ones in &quot;Christendom” God’s message of truth, and those who have fed upon it have no occasion to ever hunger and thirst. In Satan’s organization, or under it, the honest ones have hungered and thirsted both figuratively and literally. Satan’s big &quot;tree in the midst of the earth” furnishes them no shade. Those of Satan’s world claim to be its sunlight, and then they scorch and blister honest people.

<p><span class="font3">The hypocritical crowd of “Christendom” now refuse to hear the testimony which Jehovah’s witnesses bring to them and God will not give heed to the cries of such at Armageddon. When the great storm has completely wrecked Satan’s organization it will then cease. Jehovah will bid his Field Marshal to cease the fight; then the storm ceases: “and silent are their rolling waves.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> That will mark the end of Jehovah’s wrath, and also the complete destruction of Satan’s visible organization. Armageddon will be terrible beyond the description of all human words.

<p><span class="font3">When the people are told of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, both visible and invisible, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy says: “Those scriptures do not apply to us, because we have made a covenant with death and with hell and are at agreement therewith.” Verse 15: “When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. ’ ’ The refuge or hiding place of the entire Catholic scheme is a great mass of lies. Jehovah’s positive declaration is that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has made with death and hell a covenant which shall not stand, but shall fail.

<p><span class="font3">To compromise with “Christendom’’ by touching the unclean thing or by having anything in common with her or by holding any official position under her organization, God’s remnant would thereby be required to forsake the joy of the Lord, and that would mean to “leave my wine, which cheereth God and man”, that is, Jehovah God and “the man Christ Jesus”. Jehovah has joy in the vindication of his own name, and those who “walk in the light” with Christ Jesus, the Vindicator, have partnership with him in vindicating His name. This the wine of the vine here pictures. (1 John 1: 5-7) Jehovah God finds cheer in the wine from his “wine” which he has planted for his own joy. Jehovah has given joy and strength to his royal house. This joy must remain. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/35</span></p>

Likewise today the modem Philistines, when considering their position and hearing what the Samson class have to say, look with fear at what might come to pass and they trust in their own allied strength and think they have the Samson class where they can watch them and get rid </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of them</span><span class="font3"> at will. Samson prayed to Jehovah; likewise the Samson class pray to God without ceasing. Of himself Samson did not have strength to pull down the great house, but Jehovah was about to furnish all the needed strength. Likewise the Samson class have no power to pull down Satan’s house, but God gives them the strength to declare his purpose to accomplish that very thing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/36</span></p>

So now all the remnant who have Gideon’s spirit say at all times, “Jehovah shall rule over the earth.” Jehovah and Christ Jesus are their teachers, and all the remnant must be one, standing shoulder to shoulder, looking well to the kingdom interests committed to them, and in so doing individual self must entirely disappear. All things such creatures have are committed into God's hands and must be devoted to his service. He is no respecter of persons, as there are now no individuals singled out and placed above their fellows in his visible organization. Love is the principal thing.

Such fear must be put away at some time; and how?

Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the gathering to himself of the faithful, and they there receiving instruction from the Lord, they have been purged of all fear.

Jehovah has continued to take from among the nations others whom he has planted as his trees to be witnesses for his name. These too must prove their integrity before they can be fully made members of Jehovah’s glorious organization. These trees are planted by him beside his still and deep waters of truth, that they might drink deep of these precious things that God has provided and be in the image and likeness of his beloved Son, being completely devoted to him and his kingdom.

This, both for themselves and for others, was really meat to them, because it was God’s will. At Armageddon the faithful will feast on Jehovah’s great “sacrifice”, the slaughter of Satan and his organization.

(2 Pet. 3:9) &quot;Christendom” thinks Armageddon is too remote, if it ever comes at all, to even warrant serious consideration, and this is due to the unsound advice given by the clergy. But the &quot;Faithful and True” on his war mount, followed by his armies in heaven, will leap forward to battle against Satan’s organization, and particularly &quot;Christendom”.

<p><span class="font3">God’s remnant see and appreciate the truth that there are two mighty organizations'facing each other for final battle and that those who are in God’s organization are absolutely in need of divine strength to be exercised in their behalf. Such strength is exercised only in behalf of those wholly devoted to God. By Christ’s blood are we redeemed and made righteous before the Lord God, and by his merit are we privileged to be partakers with him in his kingdom. (Col. 1: 14-16) However, to enter into the kingdom we must suffer reproaches like those upon Jesus, hence suffer because of faithfulness in bearing testimony to the truth, which testimony is now committed to the remnant.

The blindness of the other eye was properly charged to the Philistines, and for that they must settle with Jehovah, because Samson was his servant. Not for personal vengeance Samson cried, but for vindication of Jehovah’s own name. Likewise with Jehovah’s witnesses. Their own negligence had contributed to their partial blindness; but modern Philistines are responsible for bringing about complete blindness, and they pray vengeance upon the modern Philistines for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/36</span></p>

At the time of his coming the consecrated were in prison or restraint to Satan’s organization. When brought out of Satan’s prison and to the .temple the approved ones were formed into the “faithful and wise servant” class and became part of the elect servant.

Every human creature that obtains life must obtain it as a gift of God through Christ Jesus, and this is the only way. All such must have their sins washed away by exercising faith in Christ’s shed blood. In consecrating to God by faith in that blood they stand approved before the judgment seat. They keep their robes clean by continuing in faith and devotion to God and his anointed King. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/35</span></p>

The remnant are swift to elude the multitude of enemies, and fleet and sure of foot to hasten to the great Rock of their salvation and climb up high to safety and to there hide themselves in places inaccessible to pursuers. Jehovah keeps the faithful ones informed in advance, and they are prompt to move as he directs them. They worship God upon true and approved “high places”, far above and hence safe from the enemy. As long as they keep in these heights of service and devotion they are on The Rock and are safe under the protection of the Most High. (Ps. 18: 2) From these high places they will witness the battle of the great day and will see Jehovah win. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/35</span></p>

They hungered for spiritual food and nourishment and enlightenment, and God furnished them such enlightenment. Hearing the cry of the faithful ones who later became the “faithful and wise servant” class, Jehovah speaks of them and to the “evil servant”: “Behold, my servants shall eat, hut ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.” (Isa. 65: 13) After 1922 the class foreshadowed by Esther and Ruth were delivered from Babylon, that is, the state of prison, and were made part of the “faithful and wise servant” class, and they too were brought into the Lord’s vineyard.

<p><span class="font3">Whether any creature gets life in heaven or on earth, he must acknowledge and worship Jehovah as the only true and almighty God, and Christ Jesus as his King and Chief Executive Officer. Every creature that receives life on earth or in heaven must be absolutely loyal and faithful to God. These requirements are precedent to entering into life. The great multitude must be led by Christ Jesus and fed by him before Armageddon, and must be under his protection and taken through it. Over the ‘highway of holiness’ Christ Jesus goes, and his flock of sheep, the anointed members of the royal house, follow him.

The wise were equipped by being unselfishly devoted to Jehovah, and later their light shines more brilliantly in their devotion and obedience to the Lord. When the Lord came, they “went in’’, being permitted by the angels guarding the entrance to pass in. That means they were gathered by the Lord into the temple, being caught away “in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air”. This marks the time of the anointing, when the wise received from Jehovah the “new name” and became designated “Jehovah’s witnesses”.

Bringing to them the good tidings and 'opening to them the prison doors’ that they might go free would “give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning”. Restrained in prison, they had the “spirit of heaviness”; but now, such being released and made free to serve Jehovah, and being identified with others serving God who had brought them the message of deliverance, those who thus brought them the message would be thereby giving them “the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/35</span></p>

Every one who is a faithful and true follower of Christ, who maintains his integrity toward God, will be and must be reproached.

This rule concerning those who are bound in fetters of ignorance is announced in the above words. With the Lord’s coming to the temple knowledge has increased, and all who have made a covenant to do God’s will have opportunity to grow in knowledge and in wisdom.

Persecution by the enemy increases, but this does not stop them from rejoicing. On the contrary, they continue to “joy in the God of my salvation”. (Hab. 3:18) The remnant know they are on the side of Jehovah and that he is their God.

Thereafter God’s people were brought into the temple, and do there praise Jehovah’s name and his King. Their praise and activity began particularly in 1919. Those who gave their allegiance to David and made him king showed their faith in God’s promise to Israel. Because of their faith they were counted righteous.

If it pleases God to continue to show his witnesses that they are pursuing the right course and he does so by unfolding to them the prophecies he caused to be written, then the remnant will continue to receive such information with much joy and thanksgiving. If we find one prophet corroborating another, then we may know that such corroborative testimony is essential for the welfare of God’s people.

<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Jehovah has kept his war equipment out of sight and has given Satan full opportunity to make good his boastful challenge, but at Armageddon there will be a complete change and Jehovah’s forces will be fully revealed. There he will completely uncover his “bow”, make it twang and throw a shower of arrows against the enemy’s -forces. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s battle bow, and he will hurl his irresistible strength against the enemy and work havoc to the enemy’s forces. Jehovah gives to his faithful remnant full assurance by revealing to them the meaning of his prophecies that they may be strengthened. Long ago he gave his Word and bound it with his oath, and thus gives double assurance to those who rely on his Word. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Some suffer one indignity, and some suffer another, but all suffer because of their unity in Christ and faithfulness unto God and Christ. The question each one must now answer in the proper way is, Are you consecrated and wholly devoted to God and Christ Jesus, and have you evidence that you are God’s child, and are you faithfully performing the commission given to you by Jehovah? If so, then you may be suffering, either directly or indirectly. If directly, then you are aware of that fact. If indirectly, you are suffering because of your companionship with others who are enduring greater physical suffering for righteousness. One being in this condition, it is faithfulness to God and his kingdom that is required. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">None of God’s remnant are heard now to say they want to die and go to heaven before Armageddon. Their desire is to live and see Jehovah execute his judgment upon the enemy in vindication of his holy name, regardless of how terrible that may be. It is His fight, and they know that he is right. Now they rest in faith and “sing aloud upon their beds'” of ease. (Ps. 149: 5) While they tremble for what they see coming upon the peoples of earth, they know that their own safety is in God’s mighty hand. There they will rest. Habakkuk trembled because of the frightful destruction that will result to the people “when he who should invade with his troops should come up against the people”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.,</span><span class="font3"> margin) This means, when Gog begins his assault, Jehovah will invade Gog’s forces and cut them to pieces. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/35</span></p>

Likewise when He is enthroned, the great multitude (Rev. 7: 9) are not discerned and understood and are not Christ’s disciples. It is after he is presented as King and seated upon his throne of judgment that the great multitude is discerned with “palms in their hands”.

<p><span class="font3">God did not save them out of their distresses by taking them to heaven, but by stopping the World War, opening the way for further service to the faithful. Satan’s organization is called “Babylon”. There was where the faithful servant class were restrained and imprisoned. But in 1919 God began to bring forth these faithful ones and give them light and to send them forth in his service with joy. Thus Jehovah did by the hand of his ‘elect servant’, whom Cyrus foreshadowed. (Isa. 45: 1-4) Not that God literally broke the gates and iron bars of a literal prison; but Babylon’s organization was holding his chosen people, and his servant class as a whole as prisoners were restrained, and Jehovah exercised his power in behalf of these and released the prisoner class, opening to them again the way of service.

The word “salvation” conveys the thought of something saved, such as the remnant. These are “the feet of him . . . that publisheth salvation”. (Isa. 52: 7) These are clothed with the “garments of salvation”. (Isa. 61: 10) These are the ones that “cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses”. (Ps. 107: 13,14) These say unto the Lord: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118: 25) “The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first.”—Zech. 12: 7.

Jehovah’s capital organization is “the holy city”, the “new Jerusalem”. All those who abide in the blessed organization must be “virgins” at the time presented to the Lord Jesus, the Bridegroom, and Head of the holy organization: “espoused ... to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” (2 Cor. 11:2) The whole organization is symbolically shown as “the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband”.

<p><span class="font3">The “robes” mean their own public profession by which they identify themselves as trusting in Christ’s blood as mankind’s redemptive price, and by openly taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. The great multitude do their own washing; that is, by the course of action they take they break away from Satan’s unclean organization and openly show themselves on Jehovah’s side. This they do by openly confessing their devotion to God; “with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Rom. 10: 10) Coming to a knowledge of the fact that Jehovah’s name must be vindicated and that that is the important question, they not only confess themselves on his side but give assistance to his temple company in bearing witness to the honor and name of Jehovah God.

Likewise Jesus gave all credit, honor and glory to his Father. He was sent to speak in his Father’s name and to vindicate his Father’s name. He refused to deviate from that fixed purpose, and therefore “made himself of no reputation”, but was entirely obedient to his Father’s will. Manifestly therefore it is to be seen that they who would receive the approval of the Lord must walk humbly before him and take no credit to themselves for what is accomplished, but must give all honor to Jehovah.

Waters flowed over mine head,” but did not get into the dungeon. (Lam. 3 : 53, 54) Then “the Lord looseth the prisoners”. For what purpose? “To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.” (Ps. 102:21,22) Surely this means when the Lord Jesus appears at the temple, and before him are gathered the nations. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/35</span></p>

The zeal and devotion of those faithful ones during that period often brought the modern Philistines into great embarrassment and distress. Jehovah used his faithful ones for that very purpose. His vengeance expressed against the Philistines through Samson foreshadows the expression of his vengeance against modem Philistines, who conspired to injure Christ’s faithful followers proclaiming the Lord’s presence and the nearness of his kingdom.

<p><span class="font3">&quot;The man Christ Jesus” has now actually entered into &quot;glory and honour” (Psalm 8: 4,-5), and Jehovah’s witnesses declare his glory and honor. They honor the Father and the Son. While they do not honor any man on earth, they do obey Jehovah’s commandments to honor the Son even as they honor the Father. (John 5: 23) They continually honor Jehovah and Christ Jesus, his beloved Son, by telling the people that God’s kingdom under Christ his King is the only hope of mankind, and that it will completely vindicate Jehovah’s name. Therefore is fulfilled the prophetic parable of the trees as to God’s remnant in their refusal to ‘leave their fatness wherewith they honor God and man’.

Then he has a pure heart. One is a servant of Jehovah when he renders service to Jehovah and does so unselfishly or with a pure heart. (Rom. 6: 16) The servants of God generally have been wrongfully judged by most men because men look only at such things as the natural eye can see. God knows the heart or motive of his servants, and he judges them righteously. Commentators have leveled much criticism against Samson.

Its refuge of lies shall be completely swept away. Heretofore no opposition to the Roman Catholic organization has been able to stand.

<p><span class="font3">That meant that he had been a Nazarite before he had any power to determine the matter for himself. God had foreordained that Samson should be a Nazarite, manifestly for the purpose of performing his part in the great prophetic drama. To be a Nazarite one must not shear his hair. Neither Jehovah nor his “woman” (his organization) could relieve Samson of the obligation of carrying out the terms of the Nazarite vow, because God does not reverse his law. The same is true of those for whom Samson stood in this prophetic drama. One, having become the child of God through his woman or organization, and fully devoted to him, must continue so for ever to have God’s approval. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/36</span></p>

Due to the fact that they told the truth, many of these faithful ones have been foully killed. What was the real reason for it'? Because Satan’s earthly agents feared these men who were faithful to God? Not at all. It was because these faithful ones were proclaiming the truth concerning God’s kingdom under Christ and that proclamation of the truth was a challenge to the Devil.

Today the Samson class pray to God and call upon his name aloud and herald his message far and wide that the Philistines may hear and have opportunity to know by what power their calamity is coming upon them. “For they shall know that I am Jehovah.” The remnant now are fully aware of the meaning of the great issue at hand and know the key position, and they pray to Jehovah to show His strength and pull down the wicked organization. Samson cried out: “Only this once, 0 God.” He knew this would be his final effort, and wanted to make the most of it. Now is “the day of Jehovah”. It is only “one day”.

<p><span class="font3">The cruel, dishonest and covetous elements have thought to put themselves beyond the power of all punishment; thus they have builded their organization “that [they] may be delivered from the power of evil”. “Evil” means a calamity upon the wicked, inflicting punishment upon such for wrongdoing. That punishment or evil comes from Jehovah. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its dupes arrogantly carry on wicked practices, all the time claiming to be immune from punishment at the hand of Almighty God.

The overshadowing cloud symbolically spoke of Jehovah’s presence. The fact that it overshadowed the three disciples suggests that fulfillment of this prophetic vision would take place at the time of the Lord’s second presence.

Thus notice and warning have been served upon Satan’s earthly ruling groups and those under them. Among them are found some people of good will called “Jonadabs”. These have been reached by the refreshing waters of truth and thereby been divided or separated from Satan’s organization. In the mighty and spectacular conflict at Armageddon the literal earth will be split with rivers flowing out from such cleavages or open places, and the peoples will be divided and split away from one another and will blindly fight one another.

With their going forth the enemy has put forth his greatest endeavors to devour them, because they are delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ in obedience to God’s commandment. No amount of persecution has dampened the zeal of the faithful ones. They have observed the Lord’s hand dividing the people. They have seen the “goats” assembling together under the commandment of Gog to carry out Satan’s will, and they have observed the honest “sheep” class gathering themselves into a company under the Lord’s leadership.

That people must be a militant organization because they are fighting against and must continue to fight against the Devil and his organization. Now every one of God’s remnant must resist the Devil and do it vigorously. That means to resist the Devil’s agents by truly and faithfully serving the Lord. That means a fight to the end, and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will continue fearlessly to follow his leading whithersoever he directs them to go. These faithful ones refuse to have anything in common with Satan’s worldly organization. With full confidence in Jehovah and his executive officer, Christ Jesus, the faithful go forth to the performance of their covenant.

They give the appearance of weakness, because they are but few in number and possess not this world’s riches, nor political power nor influence. They trust wholly in Jehovah and his King. Like blind Samson, since 1922 the Samson class, blind to the reproaches, taunts, jeers and repeated insults heaped upon them, have determined, by the Lord’s grace, to get themselves into a position that they may have some part in vindicating Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s remnant have carried the fruits of the kingdom to the ones pictured by Ruth and Esther. The Ruth and Esther class were prisoners to some part of Satan’s organization, whether in the church systems or outside, because they were dominated and kept in restraint by Satan. Hearing the truth, however, they responded thereto, and are brought to Zion and into God’s great organization. The faithful remnant continue to bear the kingdom fruits to others, and in this work God ‘‘suffereth not their cattle to decrease”. Cattle symbolize the means of carrying on the work of the Lord’s organization and represent both inanimate as well as animate vessels or instruments.

Patience means constant and steadfast forward movement in performing their God-given commission and doing so amid great persecution, at the same time rejoicing to have part in suffering reproaches like those the Devil heaped upon Christ Jesus for his faithfulness in telling the truth. ‘‘Even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” There is no other way to enter into the kingdom save through suffering for righteousness’ sake; and the remnant, knowing that truth, rejoice to be permitted to fight on God’s side.

The Philistines were privileged to be in the land God had assigned to his chosen people, and they tried to thwart God’s purpose to set up his typical kingdom there.

It is the “feet” of the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, standing upon the mountains, that now deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ by God’s grace. In that position high up in the mountain Jotham pictured Jehovah’s remnant now in the secret place of the Most High, from which place of security they constantly proclaim the Lord’s message.

Prophecy he caused to be written so that it can be understood only in God’s due time, and then by those who love him.

Prior to the Lord’s coming to the temple the eyes of the faithful on earth were blinded concerning many things, as shown by Deuteronomy 29: 4.

He quoted part of that prophecy and applied it to himself, but omitted in the quotation the words “the day of vengeance of our God”. After he is enthroned Christ Jesus appears at the temple for judgment, which judgment includes not only the declaration of God’s vengeance but the execution thereof.

He is the real Sun, “the Light of the world.” No more shall the great multitude, which stands “before the throne” (Vs. 9), hunger and thirst.

One might temporarily be overreached by the enemy and quickly repent and receive forgiveness; but to separate himself from the Lord would mean his eventual end in destruction.

At Revelation 9: 7, 8 the followers of Christ Jesus, the faithful and the true, are likened unto locusts with faces of men with long hair.

<p><span class="font3">This also well pictures defeats inflicted upon modern Philistines during the Elisha period of the church. Following the “great slaughter’’Samson went to dwell in cliffs of the rock Etam. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Etam</span><span class="font3"> means “place of ravenous birds’’, such as eagles. Samson preferred to dwell there rather than among his brethren, thus to show complete reliance upon Jehovah for protection and not to trust for help or protection from his weak-kneed faithless brother Israelites. Likewise Jehovah’s true and faithful servants have found refuge and consolation in the great “Eock of Ages’’, Jehovah, and not among those who are weak-kneed and faithless. Although surrounded by the beastly, ravenous organization of Satan, in the Great Eoek God’s people have been sheltered and protected. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Why should anyone, so greatly favored by Jehovah by being made part of the new nation, “go” to have part in the rule over this ungodly world? Should a Christian so do he would be refusing to express Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s wicked organization. Hence he would be compromising with the Devil. God’s people today, by reason of enlightenment from his Word, are far better equipped than those of the world to put in operation an equitable rule among men; but to turn aside from their God-given commission and to yield to flatteries of men of this world by accepting or participating in holding office, would mean to fail in the purpose for which Jehovah has called them. They would fall into Satan’s flattering snare and be for ever destroyed. Hence they refuse to yield to worldly flattery or coercion. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With the Hierarchy (modern Philistines) disgraced and destroyed, the honest people, including the ‘ ‘ Catholic population”, will seek Zion, God’s organization. David represents Christ Jesus, the Beloved of Jehovah. The fear of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, means the release of millions of “Catholic population” from bondage to the wicked Hierarchy. This calls to mind the words of John: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations.” The great multitude is beginning to be manifested. Many of this great multitude shall march away from the influence of the Catholic organization. The people of good will of all nations shall come and worship before the Lord. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is these “kings” and “princes”, the political and commercial rulers, together with the clergy, that have conspired against the Lord and his anointed, and Jehovah says he will laugh at them and have them in derision. (Ps. 2: 2-5) He will bring them to nothing. (Isa. 40: 23; Ps. 76: 12) Satan’s visible organization has many apparent strongholds. All these are a joke, when compared with the ‘all power in heaven and in earth’ committed to Christ the King and mighty Warrior. No earthly or devilish stronghold will be able to hold out against the assault made by the Lord’s armies. Certainly God’s purpose is that his remnant keep these things in mind at all times, that they may now be strong in faith and bright in hope. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The day is here for the final test, and Satan’s hordes are bent on forcing all who serve God to become unfaithful, fall away and die. The enemy is certain to fail in his efforts. Those who love and serve Jehovah do not now lean to their own understanding, but they are trusting in the Lord; and, true to his promise, he is guiding them in the way they should go. Let the remnant in Germany, Quebec, New Jersey, and any other place on earth, and regardless of all manner of persecution, stand firm and rely confidently upon Jehovah. Persecution of the faithful will increase from now on until the great war. We should expect nothing else nor desire anything save what Jehovah permits. While within themselves the remnant are without strength to withstand the enemy, let each one remember that “the eternal God is thy refuge’’.—Dent. 33: 27. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah at Armageddon will level things. His remnant now pray and sing, when they see these things coming to pass, because they know that Jehovah will vindicate his name and that they shall have the privilege of being on his side and beholding his victory. His ways of long ago he can and will duplicate at Armageddon on a far grander scale than ever before. In the long ago past God performed certain acts which there in miniature vindicated his name, but at Armageddon his work will be strange and miraculous, beyond anything that has ever been done: when he comes forth to defend his cause and people he will “be his old self again”, and all creation shall know that he is the Almighty One.

<p><span class="font3">One of the specific commandments given to the consecrated by the Lord Jesus at his coming to the temple is: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” Some have thought they could ignore this command and still get into heaven; but all the Scriptures appearing upon the point show they cannot ignore this commandment, refuse to have part in the witness, and yet have entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Only those who obey receive the Lord’s approval. This was emphasized at the transfiguration vision by the words: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him”; that is, ‘obey him.’ To hear what the great Prophet now says means, not idleness, but diligence to perform the work commanded.

<p><span class="font3">At verse 6 it is written: “Thou shouldest . . . raise up the tribes of Jacob,” the faithful remnant. The elect servant not only establishes the earth, but is commissioned “to cause to inherit” or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> “to bring into possession” the “desolate heritages”. This applies first to spiritual Israel, which had been dispossessed during the World War period. Such then become “trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that [his name may] be glorified”. “And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities.” (Isa. 61: 3, 4) This waste had been committed during the World War period. The building up of God’s people, the elect, came first; then follows the work in behalf of the “other sheep”, the “great multitude”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">&quot;Christendom’s” sanitary and medical corps that have fought against diseases will be powerless at the time of Armageddon to stay the pestilence and disease. Jehovah God will smite the enemy therewith. All against his holy organization are pictured by the unfaithful Jerusalem; the faithful ones, by faithful Jerusalem. “Christendom,” having fought against the real servants of the Lord, shall suffer the pestilence and plagues which God has caused to be described in his Word, as at Zechariah 14: 12. The basic sense of “burning coals </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font3"> diseases] ” is that of burning, whether with hot coals, lightning or disease. Warning concerning these burnings has been given to the nations by Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to the Lord’s commandments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Now we see a company that exactly fits the description. They look to the throne of God and Christ, and to no other place. Therefore they are “before the throne” and in the sight of Jehovah and his King. They vote for God’s kingdom and participate in the publication work of advertising the King and the kingdom. They have the recognition of the throne, and God turns his favorable attention to them so that they may be hid in the day of his anger. Jona-dab being used as a type of this &quot;great multitude”, and these of the great multitude being like Jonadab, God’s promise to Jonadab now applies to them: ‘ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.”—Jer. 35:19. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Such vengeance or vindication involves Jehovah’s witnesses because they are his representatives and are the ones the enemies reproach and against whom they conspire to bring about their destruction. The account must now be squared and his holy name vindicated. Jehovah did not authorize the Philistines to blind Samson, nor did he lay upon modern Philistines the duty of bringing about the blindness of his faithful servant class. The effort on the part of modem Philistines is therefore presumptuous before the Lord, for which sin they must answer. They have reproached his name by willfully misusing and ill-treating his witnesses. Therefore they must and will suffer destruction at the Lord’s hand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the dark period of the World War Jehovah’s people did not realize that their King had come to the temple. Not for some years thereafter did they learn and appreciate it. Then they did turn to Zion, the stronghold of which is Jehovah and his King and Vindicator. Those prisoners of hope and of Zion, being loosed in 1919 and brought into full accord with Zion at the inauguration of the new covenant, were united with the Lord in the temple. Throughout the temple they began to be enlightened and later came to an appreciation of the foregoing and other prophecies. Since being brought into the temple they appreciate that the Lord has rendered unto Zion, including themselves, a double portion. They are given a double portion of Elijah’s spirit.

<p><span class="font3">The prophet cries out, “How long?” that is, How long will it continue? The answer is, Not very long now, because the day of the battle of Jehovah draws nigh.

Thus the ruling element loads itself with burdens, pledges or heavy debts that will never be paid by them. Therefore God will require an accounting by them at Armageddon, and commands his witnesses to now take up the “taunting proverb” and say, “Woe to him!” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/35</span></p>

Despising instruction they oppose the instruction that God gives to his people through his appointed method. Such opposers pursue their own selfish way, and hence are lawless. Being lawless, they violently oppose Jehovah’s witnesses. Being workers of lawlessness or iniquity, they thereby give evidence that they have no knowledge. Jehovah through Christ Jesus now teaches his people.

<p><span class="font3">A knowledge of the truth will make manifest the glory, weight and supremacy of Jehovah God. At Armageddon Jehovah will fill all the earth with the unmistakable manifestation of his supremacy and terrible power, weight and greatness of himself, and thereby make all creation know that Jehovah is the Most High. Jehovah’s witnesses now spread the gospel message throughout “Christendom” by radio, books and other means, but that is a very small matter compared with what shall come to pass at Armageddon and which will disclose the glory of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3">By putting Jotham high up on the mountain to deliver His message, Jehovah provided the means for his escape from the wrath of the men. of Shechem. This finds its greater fulfillment in this, that Jehovah has provided a way for his faithful witnesses to escape the wrath of Satan’s agents now on earth and that he will protect and preserve his faithful ones during the time of the great battle at Armageddon. The remnant find security in him who is the great Well of life and truth. He is their strong tower and refuge.

<p><span class="font3">“Day Star” here means the “Morning Star”, which is Christ Jesus, the glorious King. (Rev. 22: 16) The rising of the “day star” clearly relates to the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, and his sending forth his angels to direct the course of action to be taken by those on earth who are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom. The prophecies of the Scriptures are directed to his church. God, by the prophet, had said: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of [spiritual] Israel.” (Num. 24:17) Christ Jesus is “the Bright and Morning Star”, who proclaims the new day.

They did. not then discern and have not since discerned the true teachers, but look to men for instruction. Not partaking of “food convenient”, many who afterwards repented, as well as others who did not repent, drew near to the gates of spiritual death. (1 John 5: 16) Therefore, says Proverbs 10: 21, ‘the fools died for want of wisdom.’ Such do not serve and praise the Lord, and are at the very gates of death.

Therefore the enemy or conspirators rush to the work of persecuting the Lord’s anointed. The remnant come to know that the grand rush of the enemy is futile, because God is their shield.

It was in 1927 that Jehovah’s witnesses were turned loose upon “Christendom” to do the work God had provided for them to do. “The four angels,” or Jehovah’s witnesses, scattered to the four corners of the earth, were now better prepared than they had previously been to carry the message of God and his kingdom to the people. That marked the beginning of a campaign calling upon the people to break away from bondage to Satan’s organization and declare themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom. The drying up of the river Euphrates followed, signifying that other bound ones would be released and march joyfully to Jehovah’s organization.

Those whom he pictured are likewise sunny and pleasing to those who love God, and at the same time they are all desolators of the antitypical Philistines. Samson’s birth was the beginning of Israel’s deliverance, and corresponds with the time when Christ Jesus began to turn his attention to the things of the earth and began to prepare the way before the Lord, which time was from about 1878 onward. Samson therefore appears to represent the work of the Lord performed by and through his people during that period of time from 1878 onward and which is known as the Elijah work. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“From the bowels of my mother” means ‘from God’s woman or organization’, showing that Jehovah prepared his King and his kingdom before the birth and therefore the King must wait until God’s due time for him to go forth and rule. Isaac, a type of Christ Jesus, was named before his birth. Likewise the Greater Isaac, Christ Jesus the King, was named before his birth. Before the kingdom’s birth, in 1914, so “my name” was mentioned, to wit, The Servant. For forty years before 1918, and even for some time thereafter, identity of “The Servant” was in doubt, some thinking it to mean a man on earth. The purpose of the Servant is to give witness to the name of Jehovah and to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and this has been seen and understood only in recent years. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Daytime and nighttime means all the time; hence the great multitude serve Jehovah all the time, regardless of hours. They are not satisfied to work eight hours a day and quit on the strike of the clock and refuse to do what some call “overtime”, but are ready and respond to the call for service at any time day or night. Jehovah’s temple is his capital organization and therefore is on Mount Zion. To serve “day and night in his temple” the great multitude must come to Zion, God’s organization, with Jehovah’s witnesses, who are a part of the temple, and not worship at any worldly organization called “the church”. The great multitude must follow after Jehovah’s witnesses on the highway to Zion. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Nazarite vow shows that the faithful ones pictured by Samson do not touch the dead carcass of Satan’s organization, nor eat its unclean things, nor seek heart-cheering gladness from the wine of the “vine of the earth”, Satan’s organization, but derive joy from having part in honoring God and Christ and in participating in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Samson said: “If I be shaven ... I shall become weak, and be like any other man.” Those devoted to Jehovah are unlike the men of the world, but if they put aside their love and devotion to him and thereby relieve themselves of the reproaches that come upon Christ’s followers, they become like other men of the world and no longer have God’s favor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Shutting the door does not mean that no more would be admitted to the temple, but does mean that none of the disapproved can enter and therefore to all such the door is shut. No creature on earth is qualified to say that the door to the temple is now shut so completely that none can ever be admitted. Those pictured by Ruth and Esther were brought in. later, and certainly they must be approved before they can enter through the gates into the temple. From the time the temple was set up, the entrance thereto has been shut to all lawless or disapproved ones. The shutting completely of the gate or entrance to the kingdom is a secret of the Lord. As long as there is any danger of one’s being ousted from the temple the way must be open for some approved one to enter. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">En-hakkore</span><span class="font3"> means “the fountain of the erier”, that is, the well of water provided for him that called upon Jehovah. That permanent spring of water, which God had brought forth for his name’s sake, became a memorial of his power and faithfulness toward those who called upon him and served him in spirit and in truth.

No human institution could possibly wreck the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. God will completely wreck it. What took place at Mount Perazim and Gibeon foretells exactly what is to come to pass. It is the Lord's work, and whatsoever he begins he accomplishes. The presentday persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy would, in time, necessarily result in the complete destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and their work unless God himself intervenes; and he gives his word that he will rise -up and do that very thing.

In the exercise of his loving-kindness toward his own Jehovah now reveals to his faithful remnant the meaning of his many prophecies, that his faithful witnesses may be at the time fully assured that they are in the right way, and that their hope may be strong. For the benefit of these faithful ones the waters of truth are abundantly supplied by the Lord, and the witnesses are commanded to first drink deeply of these truths and then proclaim the meaning thereof to others, that these latter may have an opportunity to choose which side to take. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/35</span></p>

Upon the Lord’s coming to the temple those faithful witnesses are first resurrected and gathered to him. Then the remnant on earth are gathered unto him to the temple, because these are taken out from the world for Jehovah’s name and they must be witnesses to his name. Every one who now enjoys the light of the temple of God was once in darkness in Satan’s world. Now these have been brought out of darkness into the light of God’s kingdom. Why? To show forth his praises. It is impossible for us to show forth God’s praises unless we have a knowledge of his will or purpose.

<p><span class="font3">The Philistines thinking that Samson’s strength was broken, and not understanding that his long hair pictured the reproach upon a faithful servant and that for that reason God had given him strength again, they would only mock at his prayer and continue to reproach God. Likewise today the modern Philistines look upon Jehovah’s witnesses as a crowd of weaklings, and give no heed to their sayings and their testimony that is borne, but continue to scornfully laugh at that and reproach God's holy name. But the Samson class is full of faith, even as Samson by faith accomplished his work. The publication of Jehovah’s Word and name is all-important, and this must be done before the destruction of modem Philistines.

Jehovah has “ordained them [i.e., the Chaldeans] for judgment”, to carry out his judgment. Those words foretell that now the remnant truly say: ‘0 Jehovah, thou hast ordained Christ to carry out the judgment work upon “Christendom” at Armageddon.’ God has also ordained, the wicked to be destroyed. “He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?” (Ps. 94: 10) Jehovah will convince all that he is the only mighty Judge, who is able to save and to destroy.

All these acknowledge that their devotion for ever is for Jehovah God, because they say: “Unto our God for ever and ever.” They have not the slightest desire for one moment to compromise with the Devil and his crowd. Such must be the attitude of all creation that receives everlasting life, including, of course, those of the “great multitude”. The question that each creature must answer in due time is, “Am I on the side of the Devil or on Jehovah’s side?” There is no halfway ground, and no one can be honest with God and at the same time try to please the Devil’s crowd. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

Now God’s people see plainly that prophecy cannot be understood by any man until it at least begins to be fulfilled, and more then until after it is fulfilled. Jehovah God brings to pass events in fulfillment of his prophecy, and these physical facts, set alongside the prophetic words, enable those devoted to God, and in whose hearts the “Day Star” has risen, to see the meaning of the prophecy. No man can uncover prophecy; but Jehovah himself uncovers it, and this he does in his own way to his own people and gives them the information by and through Christ Jesus.

Why is it of great importance that his name be vindicated ? Because his name stands for justice, wisdom, love and power. No creature could live everlastingly in happiness unless he is in harmony with Jehovah’s name; hence that name is of the greatest importance to all creatures. The vindication of His name means that he must and will enforce his judgment against all who defame his name and oppose righteousness. Wickedness must perish and for ever end.

Without feeding upon this the remnant would not be able to continue following after Christ. Certainly that is the reason our heavenly Father continues to feed his children. They must constantly have in mind the things necessary for them to do to maintain their own integrity and have a part in the vindication of God’s holy name.

This knowledge will be known universally. All will come to know that Jehovah is God. The peoples of earth will not need to wait for the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses to bring them the knowledge of God after Armageddon is over. What shall come to pass at Armageddon will furnish to all a knowledge of the supremacy of Almighty God.

To those called according to God’s purpose and who love him he makes all things to work to their good; but it must be remembered that the conditions precedent must first obtain, that is, one must love God and be one who is called according to his purpose. &quot;When one discovers that he has taken a wrongful course, the only thing to do is to reverse his course of action, take the right way, ask the Lord’s forgiveness, and then diligently strive to do God’s will. Jehovah does not make different rules for different creatures; his rules are fixed and his creatures must meet the requirements in order to receive his approval. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/35</span></p>

Not until the Lord’s coming to his temple do the remnant get an understanding of his purpose. Being taught of God they learn that his purpose is to make a glorious name for himself and that the supreme issue or question for settlement is the vindication of his holy name, and in that vindication his supremacy will be made known to all. Armageddon truly is Jehovah’s fight. Now the remnant have heard Jehovah’s words telling of the battle of Armageddon that draws very near, and they stand in awe and fear before the Lord.

<p><span class="font3">The seas of the enemy cannot retard the onward march of Jehovah’s victorious warriors. (Ps. S3: 4) Satan and his crowd have misused the natural seas. That wicked one, who has alienated the symbolic seas from Cod, claims them for himself. Neither belongs to Satan. “The sea is [Jehovah’s], and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land.” (Ps. 95: 5) The sea does not belong to Big Business. At Armageddon Jehovah can and will walk through the seas according to his will, and nothing can prevent him. Even now Jehovah will have his witness work done to completeness, according to his will, and all opposition to it shall not succeed. Jehovah has given to the people whom he has selected for his name a message, and he will see to it that they deliver it. “I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared.”—Isa. 51:15.

<p><span class="font3">Because of putting their trust in men and fearing men, they had fallen under the power of the Devil’s organization. The outlook was very black and distressing, and therefore they were in &quot;the shadow of death”. Jehovah heard their cries. By his elect servant Christ Jesus he dispelled the darkness and gave them light when he gathered them to the temple. While sitting in darkness they were marked for death by the enemy, hence &quot;appointed to die”. Satan’s crowd was determined to destroy Jehovah’s faithful people during the World War and afterwards, as other scriptures show. When the war ended, Satan’s crowd did not voluntarily remove the restraint or prison condition and release the Lord’s people, but the Lord himself &quot;brake their bands in sunder” and released his own who were prisoners. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Their &quot;robes” identify them as on the Lord’s side. These saw they were under Satan’s organization and that there was need for cleaning themselves up by getting out. The shed blood of Christ Jesus is the basis for forgiveness of sins and for God to forgive uncleanness. By believing that Christ Jesus’ shed blood is the redemptive price of mankind, and by consecrating themselves to do God’s will, based upon such belief, and by serving, worshiping and obeying the Lord, and not men, these take their stand on the side of Jehovah and participate in his service. That is the only course that would give them a white and clean appearance in God’s sight. No man can take his stand on Jehovah’s side without believing in the shed blood of Christ as the means of salvation. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/35</span></p>

Such a wise one watches for the Lord’s leadings and gladly responds to his commandments as soon as lie hears and understands them. Jehovah ’s witnesses take that course. Likewise the great multitude of Jonadabs must see and appreciate the Lord’s dealings with them, and they rejoice and are diligent in serving Jehovah, “day and night,” that is to say, all the time. (Rev. 7: 15) These being formed into God’s organization, all join in the praise and service of Jehovah because they understand and appreciate the loving-kindness of the Most High. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To participate with Christ Jesus in vindicating Jehovah’s name the remnant must be delivered and purged of all fear of the Devil or any of his agents. Now he and his crowd assault Jehovah’s people more vigorously than at any time, and yet, without fear of man or devil, but trusting wholly in the Lord, they press on fulfilling His commandments. They are not under Satan’s organization and have no fear. They know that Satan may actually kill their organism, but only God can destroy their right to life. For this reason Jesus warns them to fear not him that can kill the body, but only Him who can destroy the right to life in Gehenna. Trusting implicitly in Jehovah and his Vindicator, the faithful remnant have been delivered and no more fear the Devil and his agents.

If Manoah was in the military service, doubtless the young man Samson was at the army post with his father. This experience would instill in the young man the spirit of enmity toward the Philistines and create the fighting urge within him against the enemy. Samson appears to foreshadow John the Baptist, and the John-the-Baptist class. (Luke 1: 15) From the beginning of the John-the-Baptist work onward those who maintained their integrity toward God and remained faithful had instilled in them the spirit of war against the enemy, praying constantly and hoping for the day when the Lord will accomplish complete destruction of the enemy and the full deliverance of those who love him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/35</span></p>

It is sweet because such is a vindication of Jehovah’s name. To those who had part in the Elijah work of the church it is sweetness to know that the so-called “Protestant” clergy can no longer deceive those honest people who form the “great multitude” and who love the Lord. The Protestants had been a strong organization against the Roman Hierarchy and had been turned by the Devil to war against Christ's true followers.

Let Jehovah’s witnesses think of themselves soberly, as they ought to think. Why should a witness for the Most High be abashed and tremble in the presence of the harsh rulers of Satan’s world, or be arrogant in the presence of the most lowly person? To think soberly means that Jehovah’s witnesses must keep in mind, in substance, this: By Jehovah’s grace I am his witness.

Such creatures fear men and, having men’s persons in admiration, call attention to mistakes and derelictions of fellow men who as Christians are trying to do right, hoping to hear said of themselves: ‘Behold, what a good man he is! what a high standard he sets!’ The motive prompting men thereto is entirely a selfish one.

Compare this with Isaiah 28: 17: “Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” This indicates that God would cause his message of hard and smiting truths to rush down on the enemy, and this accompanied by the exercise of his great power, in which he will destroy the refuge of lies behind which modern Philistines have hidden and carried on their work and will completely wipe out their organization.

The members of God’s capital organization under Christ are “trees” planted by Jehovah for his glory and counted righteous.

Here at the temple the Lord has enlightened his people and made them strong and bold to go forth as his witnesses. The call for workers has not fallen off.

Each class in their turn are addressed by God’s Elect Servant, who says to them, “Go forth,” not merely out of literal prison houses, but out from Satan’s organization; and this is done shortly preceding the time of Armageddon. These three classes were in darkness. They must ‘show themselves’ by making a public appearance and public declaration that they are out of harmony with Satan’s organization, that they are out of his prisoner organization and are on Jehovah’s side, and that they are living testimonials to the name of Jehovah; and thus they must let their light shine.—Eph. 5:8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Their continuous service shows that the great multitude do not compromise with Satan’s organization at any time, and completely negatives the claim that they do compromise. With Jehovah, and not with Satan, is the place of habitation of all who love and Serve God. Christ now begins his rule even amid his enemies. By this rule all of Jehovah’s organization dwell under His protection; he “will tabernacle over them”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(T&gt;iag.)</span><span class="font3"> Thus the Jonadabs or “great multitude” are hid in the day of God’s wrath. The Christ stands in the tabernacle of God. Through Christ Jehovah dwells with and overshadows the great multitude for their protection and relief. Jehovah thus dwells with them representatively through Christ because they have fled there. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The faithful anointed ones, who fully trust in and serve Jehovah, are here told that if they are devoted to God they need .not &quot;make haste”, not be unduly excited and disposed to run ahead of the Lord, but to wait upon him that in due time he will act, and his action in this behalf will take place after he has laid in Zion his Stone, Christ Jesus the King enthroned; then He will take positive and unequivocal action against the liars. In 1918 Jehovah laid in his royal organization the Chief Corner Stone. It becomes the ‘stumbling stone’ to all those hypocritical pretenders, the religionists. Chief among these who claim to serve God and in fact serve the Devil is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The laying of this Corner Stone fixes the time when Jehovah would begin to take account with that wicked organization. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The remnant must now perform their covenant. There can be no dividing of service and devotion, nor any compromise with the world. If the servant class now give their full devotion to Jehovah God he will not bring down the wrath of Satan’s crowd upon them. Therefore he says: “Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” (Vs. 15) Clearly this implies a fight while the faithful servant class continue to declare the vengeance of our God. All of the servant class now vigorously proclaim the day of his vengeance, whereupon all those of good will, hearing the message, flee from Satan’s organization and take refuge in God’s organization. The “other sheep”-, who escape from prison and find that refuge, hear the message and retell it to others. It is a war to the end.

<p><span class="font3">God’s remnant are now the objects of all manner of abuse, but, like Samson, the world is not worthy of them, and continuing faithful unto the end they will receive and obtain a good report and an everlasting approval of Jehovah. (Heb. 11:38,39) For their encouragement God caused the apostle to write to those continually devoted to him and faithful in his service: “If ye do these things, ye shall never fall; for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” (2 Pet. 1: 10,11) Jehovah’s servant class, blind to everything of this world, now has a clear vision of the glorious kingdom under Christ, which will vindicate God’s holy name.

(Ps. 18; 31-46) In this prayer-song of the remnant the chief singer would represent Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Messenger at the temple, who oversees and directs the temple singers, Jehovah inspired Habakkuk to dedicate the prayersong to the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name; which fact implies that the remnant, the feet members of the Vindicator, must take their signals from him and sing. They are now singing a stanza of the “new song”. (Rev. 14: 1-3) The time is near when earth’s peoples, who have heard the sound of the voice of Jehovah’s witnesses proclaiming his name and kingdom, will know that Jehovah sent these singers among them, “that a prophet hath been among them.”— Ezek. 33; 32, 33.

What difference does it make how such die, just so they are faithful to God and his kingdom? Satan persecuted Jesus and his apostles for declaring the kingdom of God, which kingdom will destroy Satan and his organization. Likewise Satan and his earthly agents now persecute Jehovahh witnesses because they deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ which is committed to the remnant. The remnant must deliver this testimony or declaration of war against Satan. It is a glorious fight, and will end in a glorious victory for Jehovah and his Christ.

<p><span class="font3">How would it have been possible for the remnant to maintain their integrity toward the Lord God if Satan had been bound prior to now and there had been no assaults upon Godh people? Job maintained his integrity under great stress, and that foreshadows that the remnant must do the same thing. They must withstand the enemy; therefore says the scripture: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14: 22) The cries unto God because of the violence heaped upon them have not been displeasing to him. God caused his prophets aforetime to record the words that apply to the consecrated at the end of the world, a knowledge and understanding of which now gives to the remnant courage, strength and hope, to maintain integrity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The vision does not fail of fulfillment, nor prove to have been merely an imagination of false prophets. It is not of peace, but of war, that is, the final war. There is much evidence that the final end is near. There was a tarrying or hesitation at 1918, when the World War was stopped, but there will be no tarrying concerning the final combat. It will not be at all behind time, but will be exactly on schedule and will arrive when the worldly-wise say: ‘Now we have peace and safety.’ There is no delay in the vision’s fulfillment; but it is Jehovah’s expressed will “that the witness work must be done before Armageddon, and, while doing that work, his faithful remnant must have patience.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are now privileged to participate in gathering the &quot;vine of the earth” preparatory for its destruction. Should these, who have received the anointing of the Lord, &quot;go [and touch the unclean thing of ‘Christendom’] to be promoted over the trees” of Satan’s organization, it would mean their unfaithfulness to God, and they would lose all opportunity of joyfully participating in vindicating Jehovah’s name, also all the precious things promised by the Lord. They must be complete overcomers in order to enjoy the promises. Christ Jesus has flatly rejected &quot;Christendom’s” terms, and his faithful.fol-lowers, the remnant, must do likewise..

Today the clamor and tumult increases and every effort is made by the worldly crowd to silence Jehovah’s witnesses; but Jehovah says to those who oppose him and his message: “Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand. ” (Zeph. 1:7) The command is to all the earth to “keep silence”; but that does not mean Jehovah’s witnesses, because they are specifically commanded to carry Jehovah’s message to the people. “The earth” means the official element that controls the nations and refuses to hear the truth, but that, on the contrary, puts forth strenuous efforts to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from publishing the truth. The testimony to the name of Jehovah must proceed with zeal and vigor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s organization are here giving praise and worship to God. This they do regardless of all opposition. They do not ask any creature or any part of Satan’s organization as to how they shall worship God and when, but all these of Jehovah’s organization do worship God according to his commandments. Thus it is seen that it would be entirely contrary to God’s will for Jehovah’s witnesses to ask permission of any of the worldly organization or for a license to engage in preaching the gospel. All of these faithful ones of Jehovah have decisively settled it as to whom they will worship, and therefore they worship Jehovah God in spirit and in truth.

<p><span class="font3">The “sea” symbolically is that which gives support to and bears up Satan<sup>J</sup>s oppressive organization on earth. Its ruling factors, acting by Satan’s will and power, hold the sea in control and use it. God’s hottest anger or wrath is against such ruling factors, that exploit the people and carry on their merchandise on the sea. Supporters of Satan’s wicked rule must feel Jehovah’s strong hand. After Armageddon there shall be “no more sea”. Horses and chariots are symbols of war equipment, and this shows that it is in the time of ‘the war of the great day of God Almighty’ that salvation comes, and that it is to those people on God’s side, and that the victory in that great battle is with Jehovah God.

There is not a scripture to warrant the conclusion that the “great multitude” may show a halfhearted devotion to Jehovah and then receive the blessings of life. There is no reason to conclude that God has a back door into heaven and that a creature can show some devotion to Jehovah and then at the last moment on earth seek the Lord and enter the back door into heaven.

(Rev. 7:15) They do not enter heaven, but while the bride class, represented in the faithful remnant, is still on earth, these companions are privileged to work with and assist the bride class in the palace or temple service.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak. — Judg. 16:17. </span><span class="font3">Samson told Delilah how he might become weak, like any other man. This foretold what the Samson class did say: “We are fully devoted to Jehovah; but if it can be made to appear we are against earthly governments and hence disloyal or seditious, and if, in order to clear ourselves of such charge and reproach, we can be forced to cease preaching the Kingdom gospel whenever the governments demand that we do so, then we shall show our fear of reproach from men and shall become weak, like any other man.” The Samson class are plainly distinguishable from other human creatures by their uncompromising devotion to God and by their willingness to bear the reproaches that come upon Christ’s true followers. If they should avoid such reproaches, then in the world’s eyes they would be like other men. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has given “oaths of chastisements” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font3">in giving his Word on oath into the hand of Christ Jesus, whom he has commissioned to bring punishment upon all of Satan’s organization. Not only are his oaths a double assurance to the true followers of Christ Jesus, but they are also “the judgment written” against the enemy organization, which Jehovah’s remnant sing forth at the fulfillment of these oaths or judgments. To the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel, which is “the Israel of God”, Jehovah has declared his Word and has bound it with his oath, by which it is impossible for him to lie. Therefore the hope of his remnant is made strong, and this causes them to sing forth with joy, W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">These have desired a haven of rest. Jehovah will guide them to it. Before the Armageddon storm breaks forth in all of its fury the Jonadab multitude must set out on the way to the haven God has for them. This they must do by taking their stand unequivocally on Jehovah’s side. Their journey begins on a troubled sea of ungodly people. In the face of opposition they push forward that they might be found in a plaee of safety. Only Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, can guide them and bring them alive through the storm to their desired haven. “For the elect’s sake” Jehovah shortens the trouble, which began in 1914, to enable the witness to be given that the people of good will, the great multitude, may he gathered and brought into “their desired haven”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The first prisoner company brought out of restraint to Satan’s organization were made the Lord’s &quot;faithful and wise servant”, to whom he committed the kingdom interests on earth, and who were made Jehovah’s witnesses. These were prisoners until 1919, when they were loosened by the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s elect servant. Then these loosened ones became of The Servant. This Mordecai and Naomi class are not all the prisoners; there are others, since it is written that the entire world lies under the wicked one. Next there must be brought forth a class pictured by Ruth and Esther. Then these also must be used by the Greater Cyrus in bringing others out of the prison house of Babylon. All of this work must be done before Armageddon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Philistines had been brought out of Egypt and into Palestine; thus they pictured a people who outwardly appeared to have come out of the world* as Egypt pictured the world, and which people professed to worship God but in fact are children and worshipers of the Devil. They are the ones hypocritically pretending to serve God and who bitterly oppose and persecute God’s true people. Indisputable historical evidence proves beyond all doubt that the Philistines pictured particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. As God permitted the Devil to remain and continue to exercise power over man, so God left the Philistines in Palestine as a test to the Israelites and thereby afforded opportunity for them to prove their integrity toward Jehovah, and this by steadfastly resisting the Philistines. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God is the Great Rock. (Deut. 32:4) Daniel 2: 44, 45 discloses that out of Jehovah’s organization he takes a “stone” or “rock”, his anointed King, Christ Jesus, and this Stone grows to a mountain, and fills the earth and rules the whole world. The rock that Jesus mentioned is The Christ, whom Jehovah had selected and anointed and to whom he has delegated the work of building His royal house, the church of God. Jehovah, the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, has exalted him above all and “hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body”. (Eph. 1: 22, 23) It is Christ Jesus who builds up the church and who is its foundation: “in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of thy fathers shall he thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.—Ps. 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Instead of the earthly fathers of Christ Jesus these faithful men become the children of Christ Jesus, because he, by the will and commandment of Jehovah God, becomes the Father or Life-giver of men and therefore is called “The everlasting Father”. Jesus had no heavenly ancestors, no fathers in heaven, because Jehovah is his sole Father there. Jehovah raised him from the dead and exalted him to highest place in his organization, and makes Jesus “The everlasting Father” to those onee his earthly fathers, and to all those who on earth ever receive life everlasting. These fathers the Lord in due time raises out of death, and makes them visible rulers or princes of his kingdom on earth, and all of Jehovah’s organization is one grand harmonious organization, giving service and praise for ever to Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Tears were shed because of reproaches brought upon Jehovah’s holy name, and which were brought there by the false persons who claimed to be God’s servants. The honest ones shed tears because they could not understand why men who profess to serve God reproach his holy name at the same time. Upon receiving the message of truth and learning that Satan has ever reproached Jehovah’s name and that all his servants have, by fraud, deceit and false pretenses, brought reproach upon that holy name, and that soon Jehovah will vindicate his name by and through his kingdom under Christ, the tears of these honest ones have ceased to flow; in the place thereof joy has filled their hearts, their faces have appeared glad, and they have fully turned to the Lord. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Modern Philistines ‘deal by revenge and with a despiteful heart’, and the Lord’s faithful people continue to suffer. Many have wondered why God permits this. Let hone of the faithful be disturbed. Let all who love God and Christ Jesus now fully rest in faith and with greater determination than ever go on with the Lord’s service, knowing this, that God’s announced purpose to rise up and smash the enemy will soon take place and every one who continues faithful to the Lord amid all these trials shall receive the everlasting blessing of Jehovah. Surely Jesus had in mind just such times when he said: “He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” Our God, whom we serve, will save and deliver his people to the honor and glory of his name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Samson received Jehovah’s approval because of his faithfulness. Likewise the Samson class, continuing faithful unto death, receive Jehovah’s final approval. Some of the remnant will survive Armageddon. Therefore the Samson picture necessarily shows and emphasizes faithfulness of Jehovah’s witnesses unto death, and not the particular time or manner in which they shall die. No one can properly reproach Samson and the record made by him. His record could only picture a class faithfid and true to God even unto death; and that is exactly what the remnant must and will be. No reproach can properly be placed against them for the course they are taking in Jehovah’s service, because they are his servants, doing his will, though now objects of abuse. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Armageddon is the work of Jehovah. He will do his work at Armageddon by the hand of Christ Jesus. The fact, however, that he speaks of &quot;his work, his strange work”, &quot;his act, his strange act,&quot; indicates two distinctive parts of Armageddon: (1) That which accomplishes the destruction of hypocritical religionists; and (2) that which accomplishes complete destruction of all of Satan’s organization. As a whole Armageddon is the work and act of Jehovah, .but that part thereof which he says is &quot;his strange work”, &quot;his strange act,” refers to something very strange to many creatures. The final conflict would not -appear strange, for all professed Christians have been informed by the Scriptures and otherwise of Armageddon as one great time of trouble.

<p><span class="font3">Now the faithful, obedient ones have come to appreciate the great truth that all the things in the prophecies were written by holy men of old who were moved upon by God‘s holy spirit and that these things &quot;were written aforetime . . . for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope”. There is now no occasion for any of God’s remnant to have any doubt as to the fact that they are in the right way or to be in fear of what man or devil may do unto them. The faithful ones know that they are on the right side; and abiding in the secret place of the Most High they know that all things God will cause to work together for their own good. Jehovah is feeding them upon the food convenient for them, and they are boldly singing the praises of Jehovah and his King. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/35</span></p>

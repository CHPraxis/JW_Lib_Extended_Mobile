<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Saluting in Theory and Practice</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Consisting, first, of a protest filed with the New Jersey legislature against Fascist legislation proposed by Assemblyman McAlevy, and, second, of a highly illuminating example of flag saluting in a Florida courthouse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROTEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">O THE Members of the New Jersey Legislature :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The undersigned, citizens of New Jersey, in behalf of themselves and of other citizens of the State of New Jersey, protest against the enactment of Assembly Bills Nos. A30, A31 and A32, and as reasons therefor assign the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Terms of the Bills</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bill No. A30 requires teachers in charge of each school in the State to lead pupils in salute to the flag of the United States at all general assemblages and/or during the first hour of the first school day of each week, and makes it a misdemeanor to refuse or neglect to lead in the flag salute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bill No. A31 requires all pupils in schools, public or private, to salute at the general assemblages of said schools, and/or during the first hour of the first school day of each week, and provides penalties for the refusal to participate in such salute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bill No. A32 makes it a misdemeanor for any person, corporation, society or organization to attempt to influence any school pupil in this State against the salute to the flag of the United States by instruction printed or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Purpose of the Bills</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The announced purpose of the bills is to require principals and teachers to lead in such flag salute; to foster respect for the flag, and prevent the schools from being used for propagation of subversive doctrines; and to provide punishment for individuals, corporations or organizations whose purpose it is to influence pupils against the salute to the flag of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The actual purpose of these bills is far different from the announced purpose. The actual purpose is to set a trap, and to find occasion to do injury to a small group of people, who are residents of this State. The purpose is to convict these people of crime and to put them behind the bars. The bills are designed to squelch and suppress the activities of these people, and incarcerate them in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who are the people that have legislation aimed at them in this pointed fashion? The answer is that Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones made subject of this attack. The bills are aimed at them, and might just as well have their names printed across the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By way of information to the legislature, we assert that this is the second time bills have been introduced the primary purpose of which is to punish Jehovah’s witnesses. A year ago Assembly Bill No. 257, commonly called the “Anti-Nazi Bill”, was made a law through action of this legislature and endorsement by the governor. It was charged at the time that the bill was aimed at Jehovah’s witnesses. This was denied, but it is very significant that the only prosecution ever brought under that law was against one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As evidence of the evil purpose of the present bills we quote the following from the public press of the State:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jersey City </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> of January 13 states that the bills are “obviously aimed at activities such as those sponsored by the Jehovah’s witness sect, which has been much in the public eye of late. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Call</span><span class="font6"> of Newark, in its issue of February 9, states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the bottom of these bills [ones here referred to] lies hostility toward a religious organization, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">forbids salutes to the flag or veneration for any earthly object. This hostility is contrary to American principles of religious freedom, ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Newark </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font6"> of January 14 states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The three bills, outgrowths of recent refusal of pupils in Secaucus and elsewhere to salute the flag, etc., ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that Jehovah’s witnesses conscientiously object and refuse to salute or offer reverence and honor to anything made by a human creature. A few of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses have been expelled from the public schools because of their conscientious objection to flag saluting. There has been much publicity about it. The newspapers have made much ado. Patriotic organizations, so called, have raised a great furore. The parents of children have been arrested and haled into court. Boycotts have been instituted and bodily violence threatened against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemies of Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones who desire to see these bills passed. They would make criminals of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. They would make delinquents of the little children and have them taken from their homes. They would imprison parents and heavily punish anyone who stood by his conscientious convictions. For a number of years they have waged an unholy campaign against these Christian people. Over a thousand have been arrested throughout New Jersey, and charged with various crimes. Now these vindictive enemies come to the New Jersey legislature and ask it to frame a law which will enable them to put the criminal label on every true Christian in this State. They ask you to make it a crime to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses in this State. They ask you to put them in a position where they can dominate, browbeat, and force men, women and children to offer honor and reverence to that which is made by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order that you may be informed as to who are Jehovah’s witnesses, and what is their work, we insert and make a part of this protest a document entitled “Jehovah’s witnesses Present Their Case”. This pamphlet has been circulated in various communities, and states as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES PRESENT THEIR CASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past three years many of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested in New Jersey cities, brought to trial, and sentenced to pay fines or serve terms in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At many of the trials they have been denied opportunity to present their defense. The courts would not permit them to present any evidence showing that the local ordinances do not apply to their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is evident that the officials of these cities intend to arrest and heavily penalize every one of Jehovah’s witnesses who engage in the worship of Jehovah God in their domains. You, residents and taxpayers, hire and pay these officials. You are entitled to know about their arbitrary and oppressive acts. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses present their case. The witness who presents this to you may be arrested and imprisoned for allegedly violating the law. This is our defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Are Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are earnest and sincere Christians, who do the will of Almighty God as that is written in the Bible. Each and every one of them has entered into an agreement or covenant with Jehovah God wherein they have consecrated themselves to do His will, and to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. By virtue of this covenant it is obligatory upon them to obey the law of God, which is found in His Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are ordained ministers of the gospel, and are sent forth by Almighty God under the direction of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to eall upon the people at their homes and teach them the truth of and concerning God’s word as contained in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, its chartered purpose being as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The purpose for which the corporation is formed is the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is Their Mission?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the mission of Jehovah’s witnesses to preach and teach the gospel of God’s kingdom. They are not hired to do the work. It is done voluntarily and without financial reward. Their method of so preaching and worshiping Jehovah is to eall on the people and tell them about the kingdom of Jehovah. They display to the people books and booklets containing the gospel message of God’s Word and give them opportunity to secure this printed message if they so desire. They also offer the people invitations to hear the gospel message over the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Do They Engage in This Work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has commanded His people to preach the gospel message of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. Because of their covenant to do the will of God, Jehovah’s witnesses are in duty bound to obey the mandate to preach the gospel. These commands to preach and teach the gospel are found in God’s Word, the Bible, and are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ I, even I, am the Lord ; and beside me there is no saviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> ‘ I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. ’ ’ —Isaiah 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.’’ —Isaiah 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. ’ ’—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.’’— Luke 10: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house.”—Acts 20: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And it shall come to pass that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. ’ ’—Acts 3: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“. . . Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should J)ear witness unto the truth. . . . ”—John 18:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ For even</span><span class="font5"> hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.' ’—1 Peter 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If they failed or neglected to obey these commandments severe punishment, to wit, eternal destruction, would come upon them. The time is now here when all followers of Christ must obey His commandments, or be destroyed. This is shown in Acts 3: 22, 23, cited above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Message Do Jehovah’s witnesses Bring to the People?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Briefly summarized, the gospel of the Kingdom is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth, and the Giver of life to His creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of His creation, and His active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted Him to heaven, above every creature and above every name, and clothed Him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That JEHOVAH’S organization is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are His witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare His purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the world has ended, and that the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon His throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven, and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the relief and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Worship of Almighty God Prohibited in New Jersey</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The acts for which Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested, jailed and fined were acts of worship of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christians are commanded to worship God in spirit and in truth. (John 4:23,24) To </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">worship</span><span class="font5"> doesn’t mean to put on a pious front or look sanctimonious. It doesn’t mean to go to church or go through some religious ceremony. It does mean to revere and serve Almighty God. The one who because of unselfish love to Jehovah goes from door to door to inform people of the gospel message is engaged in the actual worship of his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In days of old three faithful Hebrews were east into a fiery furnace because they worshiped Almighty God in violation of the decree of Nebuchadnezzar. The prophet Daniel worshiped Jehovah in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. He violated the law of Darius in so doing. The early Christians suffered martyrdom at the hands of Nero because they worshiped God in spirit and in truth. Jehovah's witnesses of today are threatened with arrest and imprisonment in New Jersey cities if they obey God and worship Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Not Get a Permit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are sent by Almighty God to do His work. His law is supreme and above every human law. To apply for a permit to do His work would be an act of disobedience to His commandment. It would be an insult to the Alost High God, and would in time result in the eternal destruction of the one so disobeying. See Acts 3:22,23, cited above; also Acts 4:19, Acts 5: 34-39, and Luke 20: 25. They have no disposition to violate any law, but must obey God rather than man, and in this way they worship Him as commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Render to Casar the things that are C.esar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. ’ ’-Mark 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Supreme Court of New Jersey has quoted the above passage and decided that Jehovah’s witnesses should comply with its terms. This they gladly do. In obeying the commandment to preach the gospel, they are rendering unto Jehovah God the strict obedience required by His law. They have done all within their power to render unto the municipalities the things which the Lord Jesus Christ commands shall be rendered by those who follow Him, in that they have furnished to the police departments of all of the New Jersey municipalities their names and addresses and information that they are people of good repute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the apostle Peter and others were brought-before the High Court of Jewry charged with preaching the gospel without permission, Peter boldly answered: “We ought to obey God rather than men.’’ We submit that the statement is just as true today as then. Jehovah’s witnesses, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> people, should obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is Sponsoring These Measures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We assert most emphatically that these bills are not sponsored by those who sincerely love their country and are devoted to its interests. The ulterior purpose of the measures is so clearly shown that it becomes imperative for the members of the legislature to inquire who are back of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ones who would like to see all of Jehovah’s witnesses placed in the criminal class are religionists in general and the Boman Catholic Hierarchy in particular. The attitude of the Catholic Hierarchy is well stated in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Transcript</span><span class="font6"> of December 12, 1935, from which we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Catholics in various localities succeeded in persuading their home stations to suppress this menace to good will. [Referring to the broadcasts of Jehovah’s witnesses] More recently, Rutherford’s followers, under the name of Jehovah’s witnesses, have got into the news for refusing to allow children to salute the flag. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholics have always held that this man should not be tolerated.</span><span class="font5"> [Italics ours]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That powerful religio-political organization would like well to establish a Jesuit-Fascist regime in the United States, and its connection with this legislation should be investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why a True Follower of Jesus Christ Cannot Salute a Flag</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(A) The flag is an image, and flag saluting is a religion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The United States flag is the emblem of national sovereignty and authority. Men speak of it in highly laudatory terms, and the very attributes of deity are ascribed to it. We cite the following from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana, </span><span class="font6">Volume 11, page 316:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The flag, like the cross, is sacred. Many people employ the words or term ‘Etiquette of the Flag’. This expression is too weak, too superficial, and smacks of drawing-room politeness. The rules and regulations relative to human attitude toward national standards use strong, expressive words, as, ‘Service to the Flag,’ ‘Respect for the Flag,’ ‘Reverence for the Flag,’ ‘Devotion to the Flag,’ ‘Behavior Towards the Flag.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also the following as to the meaning of colors in the flag:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“White signifies Purity and Innocence; Red, Hardiness and Valor; Blue signifies Vigilance, Perseverance and Justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Manual of Information</span><span class="font6"> for prospective citizens published by the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“America was settled by lovers of liberty. America expects those who come here to love and revere and defend </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the flag ivhich protects them.</span><span class="font5"> It is the emblem of a free people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religion consists of the observance and practice of any ceremony or outward forms by which men attribute to some superior power, object or thing, protection or salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is but one Christianity, ot true worship of Almighty God. But there are many religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Flag saluting, as shown herein, and as practiced throughout the world, constitutes a religion. Its chief ceremony is the act of homage and obeisance shown with the motion of the hand and the repeating of the pledge of allegiance. Its distinctive doctrine is that respect, honor, devotion, reverence, and love must be offered to this symbol of the government. It affirms that the flag is sacred, pure, innocent, vigilant, just and valiant. It proclaims to all and sundry that salvation and protection come from the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These statements and acts make the flag a superior object. They give to the flag powers and attributes which are above human power. They constitute a deification of the flag and an offering of obeisance and worship to it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(B) To salute the flag would be a violation of the divine commandment stated in Exodus 20: 3-5, to wit:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States flag is the image, or emblem, of the American nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every true follower of Jesus Christ must obey the commandment above stated. He cannot, and will not bow down, render obeisance, or commit any act of worship, reverence, or honor, to the image of the government. To do so would in due time mean his eternal destruction.—Acts 3.: 22, 23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(C) The salute to the flag means in effect that the person saluting ascribes protection and salvation to the flag, whereas such comes only from Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The citation given from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Manual of Information</span><span class="font6"> for prospective citizens designates the flag as the protector of the people. The adulatory expressions ascribing to the flag sacredness, purity, justice, innocence, hardiness, valor, vigilance and perseverance further establish its deification and exaltation as the savior of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A true Christian rejoices in the salvation and protection of Almighty God (Psalm 20: 5) and will not insult the Creator by ascribing salvation to man, or to anything made by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The situation is similar to that of Pagan Rome. Caesar was the emperor. He was deified and salvation was ascribed to him. He, or his statue, was saluted in manner similar to the salute to the flag. He was exalted, honored, and saluted, and the flag today is exalted, honored and saluted in similar manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A true witness of Jehovah will salute no god but Jehovah, and will ascribe salvation and protection to no one but Almighty God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(D) Flag saluting is part of the creed of a false religion, and from such all true Christians are commanded to turn aside.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning relationship to false religions the law of God prescribes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”-2 Corinthians 6:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the days of Pagan Rome the authorities demanded obeisance and a pledge of allegiance to the deified emperor. This was given by the sprinkling of some incense on a fire before a statue—an image of the emperor. It was demanded of everyone. But the early Christians refused to give the salute. They would not bow down, salute, or render obeisance to Caesar. They separated themselves and would have no part or parcel with the religio-patriotic cult of that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This present attempt to force Christian people to join in the services of a patriotic cult is an attempt to force a religion on them in opposition to their conscientious beliefs. This is revolting to a civilized mind, and is directly contrary to the constitutional guarantees of freedom of worship of Almighty God. It is an endeavor to coerce people, especially the school children, to worship in accordance with a ritual of ceremonial patriotism. It is contrary to common sense, common decency, and the well established principles of freedom of worship, freedom of conscience, and freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bills should be denied passage for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I. Because of their obvious malicious purpose. II. Because even though enacted into law they will not foster respect for the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">III. Because they are unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Malicious Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Freedom of worship, freedom of conscience, and freedom of speech are recognized as fundamental rights in these United States. Jehovah’s witnesses are permitted to call on the people with the gospel message without interference, in most of the states. But New Jersey is different. A violent campaign has been waged against them in this State during recent years. Over a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested and thrust into prison. Hundreds have been convicted, without competent evidence. Fair trials have been denied them. Many have been thrown into jail for the sole and only reason that they were Jehovah’s witnesses. The record to date is a shame and a disgrace to this State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During recent months a number of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses have been expelled from the public schools because they conscientiously refused to salute the flag. After expelling them from school, the school authorities have haled the parents into courts under truancy laws, charging them with failure to send their children to school. It has been necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to establish private schools where these children could be educated without having a patriotic ritualistic religion thrust upon them. And now the sponsors of these bills would increase the infamy and dishonor of this commonwealth by framing class legislation to further persecute, harass, ill-treat and oppress these Christian people. They desire the legislature to furnish them with new weapons to wreak their malice upon the innocent. They would hound them in their private educational institutions, and bludgeon them into the worship of their handmade god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They would go further than that. It is well known that Jehovah’s witnesses have published and distributed a pamphlet entitled “Saluting a Flag”, giving the Scriptural reasons why a Christian cannot salute a flag. It is undoubtedly the purpose of the advocates of this legislation to arrest and imprison every one of Jehovah’s witnesses found distributing such literature. And every parent who teaches his child the truth about flag saluting will also be subject to arrest and imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The evil purpose of these bills is so glaringly manifest that no legislator should sully his reputation by casting a vote for them. They should be rejected unanimously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Patriotism Cannot Be Taught by Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This nation recently went through the “noble experiment” of endeavoring to teach temperance by law. It didn’t work. Now it is proposed to teach patriotism and devotion to the flag by force of the law. The mandate to teachers and pupils will be: Salute or go to jail. Be patriotic or get punished. The flag then becomes the symbol of force; the emblem of the iron hand; the image of dictatorial rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Does anyone for one moment imagine that such methods will foster love and respect for the flag?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Permit us to quote from the Raleigh (N.C.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Neu'S and Observer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To pass a law requiring that little children must formally salute the flag under penalty of ostracism from the public schools, is to make a pompous mockery of the natural patriotism of American children. It is to put love of country into the category of such things good for children as castor oil and neck washing. It is to make the flag not a thing of the American child’s natural reverence and adoration, not a symbol of enthusiasm, but a symbol of force. It is to make the flag not a banner to which the love of the child goes up, but a standard from which force may come down hard upon the child. In a perverse world, children are entitled to their share of perversity, and it is to dare that perversity to say to the child: You’ll love this flag or get your breeches burned. And if children, being human, don’t love that which they are ordered to love under penalty of punishment, then not the communists, but the pompous, foolish patrioteers, who would make the flag as ridiculous as themselves, will be to blame.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This kind of legislation will not be instrumental in the instilling of patriotism and love of country. It will teach parrot patriotism, deceit, and cringing hypocrisy. It will foster and foment a blaze of persecution of the people of Jehovah God, which will not furnish good advertising for the State of New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Unconstitutionality</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These bills, if enacted into law, will be unconstitutional in at least three particulars, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Christians will be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshiping Almighty God in accordance with the dictates of conscience, as guaranteed under the provisions of Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of New Jersey, and of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. The civil rights of liberty and freedom of conscience as guaranteed under Article I, Section 4, of the Constitution of New Jersey, will be denied through the forcing of a state religion on the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. Freedom of speech as guaranteed by Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution of New Jersey will be denied in that said legislation will make it a crime to teach or attempt to teach ariy school child the commandments of Jehovah God concerning saluting a flag.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom of Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To worship God does not mean to kowtow, attend church, look holy, or go through some religious ceremony. It does mean to obey and serve Jehovah God because of love and devotion to Him. One cannot worship God if he disobeys His commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God commands His people not to render honor or obeisance to any image, or symbol, or representation of anything. This applies to the flag as the symbol—the image, if you please—of the nation. These bills, if enacted into law, will require teachers and pupils to disobey the commandments of God, and to join in the religious ceremonies of the flag-saluting cult. The laws would create a state religion. Any Christian thus violating the law of God, by rendering obeisance to the flag, could not worship (serve) Jehovah in spirit and in truth. The State through this form of legislation comes in between the individual and his Creator and prevents or attempts to prevent proper worship and devotion to Him. This would be a flagrant interference with the inherent right to worship God in accordance with the dictates of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom of Conscience</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have heretofore shown (pages 3,4) that the ceremony of flag saluting comes clearly within the definition of a religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our forefathers came to this country to escape participation in religious ceremonies contrary to their conscientious beliefs. They incorporated the principles of freedom of conscience into the fundamental law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should New Jersey attempt to turn the laws back to the intolerant practices of the Dark Ages? Why attempt to bludgeon school children and school teachers into stultification of conscience under this form of bigotry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pages of history reek with the accounts of the unholy attempts of tyrants to force their beliefs on others. Christians have suffered the rack and the pinion rather than disobey the commandments of God. A pinch of incense on the fire before the emblem of Caesar would have satisfied the demands of the patriotic cult of Pagan Rome. But, rather than render obeisance to that image, the early Christians suffered themselves to be thrown to the lions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today Jehovah’s witnesses do not court persecution, but they will not permit themselves to be forced into a state religion, or submit to a smothering of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They should not be asked to. The legislature of the State of New Jersey should have enough consideration for the fundamental principles of freedom of conscience to promptly reject these measures and refuse them passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom of Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Should not the right of the father and mother to teach their children the commandments of the Creator be fully protected by this legislature? If the legislature passes these bills and parents teach their children the truth concerning the commandments of God as stated in Exodus 20:3-5, what will happen ? They will have committed a misdemeanor and will be subject to fine and imprisonment. You will have taken from parents that most sacred of rights: the right to teach their own children the truth of God’s Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under this wrong-headed and purblind legislation no teacher in a public school, private school, day school or Sunday school will be permitted to teach to the pupils the commandments of God as stated in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No preacher will be permitted to expound the Bible in its entirety from the pulpit, if there are any pupils of school age in the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Magazines, newspapers and other publications will be permitted to publish only one side of the flag-saluting issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where is liberty of speech under that kind of despotism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What courts will sustain such shortsighted legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Jehovah’s witnesses can be made the subject of special legislation, and prohibited from teaching their children the truths of the Bible, who will next be deprived of their liberty to speak and teach?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This country went through many struggles to establish the principles of freedom of worship, freedom of conscience, and freedom of speech. Is-it wise to jeopardize them to satisfy the malicious purposes of religionists, patrioteers, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy against Jehovah’s witnesses ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Insure No Interference with Freedom of Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If it be contended that the purpose of these bills is not to interfere with freedom of worship of Almighty God as taught in the Bible, then let a proviso like the following be made a part of each one of such bills, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Provided that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any person who conscientiously believes in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and who conscientiously holds and believes that the saluting of any flag, object or image or thing is and would be a violation of God’s holy law, as set forth in the Bible, and such person shall not be compelled to comply therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians Will Obey God Rather than Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many years ago Blackstone, the leading exponent of the common law, stated with precision and clarity the relation of the statute law to the higher law of the Creator. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ... if any human law should enjoin or allow us to commit it [an act forbidden by the divine law] we are bound to transgress the human law, or else we must offend both the natural and the divine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Blackstone’s Commentaries,</span><span class="font5"> Chase 3rd Ed. 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These bills, as now written, are attempting to enjoin upon the people of New Jersey an act forbidden by the divine law: A compulsory rendering of honor, devotion, and obeisance to a man-made image of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the fact that the sponsors of this proposed legislation have had the temerity to single out Jehovah’s witnesses as their object of attack, we hereby serve notice that, as Christians who have entered into a binding covenant to obey the commands of Almighty God at all times, we will not obey or comply with the provisions of such laws. We must transgress them In order that we may not offend the divine law. We must obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Public Hearing Demanded</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We remind the members of the legislature that the “Anti-Nazi Bill”, so called, which was also specifically directed at Jehovah’s witnesses, was passed at a night session and signed immediately by the governor without opportunity for protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As citizens of this state we now demand a public hearing on each one of these bills, with the full privilege and opportunity to produce and offer evidence tending to show that the foregoing bills are inspired and sponsored by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their religious allies in a studied attempt to seize and completely control the American people, and rule them in a manner similar to the rule that is now employed in Italy and in Germany, and that the bills and the sponsors thereof are against the public interest of the American people, and particularly the State of New Jersey. This legislature is now called upon to determine whether America shall continue to enjoy freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship, as it has in the past 150 years, or that the foreign power of Rome shall change the American policy and rule the American people with an iron hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signed by)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Legal Light on the New Jersey Flag Saluting Bills</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font6">VEN New Jersey, that dark and benighted area, where Christians are jailed for the offense of walking in the footsteps of Jesus, is not yet ready to don all the garments of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. There are still men and women therein who endeavor to keep conditions where some measure of truth and justice may glimmer through the murky haze of Papal control. This was demonstrated March 17 last, in the assembly chambers of the State House at Trenton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hudson county, New Jersey, is undoubtedly the place for a blind man’s holiday. Out of its Stygian gloom and Erebian darkness came forth the muddiest, dimmest and dirtiest piece of legislation presented to any legislative body this season. Heralded by its astigmatic sponsors as measures scintillating with patriotic beams, these proposed laws proved to be instruments to darken, obscure and extinguish freedom of worship, speech and conscience in the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Assemblyman Robert F. McAlevy is the author of what are called the flag saluting bills. Mr. McAlevy is from Hoboken, of Hudson county, New Jersey. Hoboken is the place where they “sock” Christians ninety days in jail for preaching the gospel from door to door. These bills make it obligatory for teachers and pupils in all schools, public and private, to salute the flag. If enacted into law no parent could teach his child what the Bible says about image worship. No newspaper could publish an editorial against compulsory flag saluting. That is the kind of caliginous [dark] legislation incubated in the sombrous depths of Hudson county for the benefit (?) of the people of New Jersey. Undoubtedly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, visible representative of the prince of darkness, is back of the bills. They fit in with the program of that organization to extinguish all rays of liberty in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bills were placed in charge of the Assembly Committee on Education, of which Mrs. Olive C. Sandford is the chairman. They looked pretty dark to the Committee, which retained them and did not report for passage. Assemblyman McAlevy demanded of the Committee that the measures be reported to the Assembly for action. The New Jersey Division of Jehovah's witnesses appeared on the scene and demanded a public hearing on the bills so that all the facts might be shown. A public hearing was called. Proponents and opponents assembled at Trenton to tell what they thought of this kind of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In favor of the bills came representatives of the Sons of America, Daughters of America, Daughters of Liberty, Junior Order of United American Mechanics, Veterans of. Foreign Wars, and the Odd Fellows. Their arguments are summarized as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. The United States must be protected. And, of course, if all the school kids salute the flag the nation will be safe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Subversive organizations must be fought. Sure. Make the youngsters salute. That’s the way to fight subversivism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. We must prevent alien propaganda from wrecking the public school system. And if the children have the jail door staring them in the face if they do not salute, that will, of course, shut off all alien propaganda.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. The children must be taught to be patriotic citizens. And, of course, the compulsory flag salute will be just as good as castor oil for that purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. Children must be compelled to be reverent to the flag. ’Nuf said. Worship the flag or go to jail, is what they teach in Hoboken.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. Jehovah’s witnesses must be wiped out. There is the real reason for the measures. Most of the proponents studiously avoided any reference to Jehovah’s witnesses. But Joseph W. Leher, speaking for the Cape May Veterans of Foreign Wars, asserted that it was because of Jehovah's witnesses that it was necessary to adopt the bills. “Jehovah’s witnesses were not heard of ten years ago, and will not be heard of ten years from now, if the Veterans of Foreign Wars have anything to say about it,” was his treble clef anathema.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">In opposition to the bills came Jehovah’s witnesses, Newark Teachers Association, Mercer County Teachers Union, State Teachers Committee, Society of Friends, Federation of Women’s Clubs, League of Women’s Voters, Civil Liberties Union, Business and Professional Women’s Club of Orange, and Civil Liberties Committee. Their representatives turned the rays of light and truth on these medieval pieces of legislation, which pierced through the Cimmerian<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark52">1</a></sup> gloom and exposed them to all as a monumental piece of framing mischief by law. Objections to the bills as presented by the opponents were as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. True patriotism cannot be created by legislation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> Respect for the flag cannot be forced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. You cannot teach love of country with a club.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. The bills will defeat true patriotism and teach hypocrisy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. Respect for the country should be taught through educational processes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. The bills are not necessary. There is no evil existing which they would cure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">7. They will not eliminate disloyalty. The dishonest and disloyal will salute just the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">8. The bills are unconstitutional.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">9. Passage of the bills should at least be delayed until the present case on the flag saluting question is decided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">10. The laws would be impossible to enforce.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">11. The laws are an opening wedge for Fascism and a regimented state.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">12. They are designed to make criminals and imprison all of Jehovah's witnesses in the state.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">13. They will suppress freedom of speech, freedom of worship, and freedom of conscience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">14. They set up machinery which can be used to persecute innocent people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">And other points too numerous to mention. Fact upon fact and line upon line of lambent truths were cast upon this nocturnal, Hoboken type of legislation to show it forth in its true colors. And what was thus revealed? Intolerance, malice and prejudice working together to insult everything for which the flag has stood. A cog in the program of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to Hitlerize and swastikaize America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hundreds of letters, telegrams and documents were presented to the Committee in opposition to the measures, and at the conclusion of the hearing the chairman announced they would all be given careful consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bills appear to be checked for the present. But lovers of liberty in New Jersey need to be on guard. They should keep their eyes open. And don’t forget Hudson county, would-be eclipse headquarters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Saluting in a Florida Courthouse</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">LORIDA, heretofore known as the land of sunshine and flowers, is now advertising itself as the land of brutality and savagery. Some officials of that well-favored state are bent on making it a place of lawlessness and savagery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Boynton, Florida, is a small town on the east coast between Palm Beach and Miami. On March 17, Roy D. Goodrich, one of Jehovah's witnesses, called on business places and homes for the purpose of presenting to the people the gospel message. While so doing he was accosted by a so-called “peace officer”, who ordered him to cease his work. The mayor of the city assisted and ordered him out of town. A few minutes later a county motorcycle officer also told him to get out of town. Not getting out of town fast enough to suit these “gentlemen”, Goodrich was arrested, and placed in jail w’ithout any specific charge being leveled against him.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360506_files/g_E_19360506-2.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:251pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Scene in West Palm Beach (Fla.) Courthouse</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">After remaining behind the bars for a couple of hours, the county officer came and entertained him by resorting to the lowest sort of abusive language, breathing out threats, mingled with berating and false accusations. In the evening a hearing was held. This was not completed, but adjourned until the next evening at eight o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page i92)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Making hypocrites of children;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Attempting to override constitutional rights;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Grossly insulting everything for which the flag stands;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tyranny and Jesuitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This witness for Jehovah remained in the city jail for the night, but did he go to trial the next evening? No. Why not? At about six o’clock —two hours before the time for trial—officers of Boynton, with a Palm Beach county officer, came to the jail. Goodrich was searched, and all his possessions, including his handkerchief and auto keys, were taken from him. He was forced to enter an automobile which was manned by the chief of police of Boynton and the chief deputy of Palm Beach county. On arrival at the Palm Beach county courthouse the officers took their bantamweight prisoner to the sheriff’s office. He was placed in the custody of a large, heavy-set man in county uniform. Presently several motorcycle officers came in and the Palm Beach inquisition commenced. Volleys of profane, obscene and abusive language with profuse cursings were poured upon the prisoner. Over and over again he was told that he deserved to be beaten, torn to pieces, or sent to Russia. Not satisfied with defaming the prisoner, the inquisitors proceeded to dishonor the American flag. A large one was unfurled, partly on the floor, and held with their filthy fingers, with the demand that the prisoner should salute it. To this he replied, “I salute Jehovah God only.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Goodrich was then treated to a hard blow on the face. When he sought to cover the injured part with his hand and with his elbow resting on the arm of the chair, his moaning was mocked by the officers, and his elbow bumped off the arm of the chair. His feet were cruelly kicked out before him, thus causing him to occupy a sprawling position even while seated in the chair. Other blows were then inflicted by these thugs in uniform. A blow on top of the head caused him to fall to the floor. How long he remained on the floor he does not know, his first recollection being that he was being lifted to his feet and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">his lifeblood was streaming from his nose. The next that he recalled distinctly was that a door was opening in a car in which he was seated, and that he was to go to cell Number 6 in the Palm Beach county jail. His clothes, soaked with blood clear to the skin, were removed. There was one thing about this Hitleristic piece of business that was efficient, and that was the laundry service of the Palm Beach county jail. All the bloody evidence of manhandling and torture was removed, and Goodrich’s clothes were returned to him the next morning without spot and nicely pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J. P. Montz, a businessman of Miami, hearing of this medieval persecution of his friend, drove to West Palm Beach to inquire. If Montz had any idea that the Palm Beach county peace (?) officials were civilized he was quickly disillusioned. These officials denied having any knowledge of Goodrich or his whereabouts. Montz went out, but, not being satisfied, returned later to inquire further. On this call he was privileged to be treated to some of Florida’s up-to-date methods of iron rule. He was escorted into a private office. He was cursed and threatened with lynching. He was divested of all his personal possessions, including his money. They placed the brand of a burning cigar against his hand. He was then taken to a private room. His belongings were thrown into a box with trash in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it. </span><span class="font6">At the end of this room was a pool of blood, evidently that of his friend Goodrich. There were blood stains upon the clothing of some of the officers. Both officers gave evidence by their breath and conduct of having indulged freely in something stronger than coffee. Just for the offense of having inquired as to the whereabouts of one of Jehovah’s witnesses, Mr. Montz was treated as a desperate criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Rollin Jones, of Lakeland, Florida, being informed of the outrages, went to the jail at West Palm Beach to inquire. He also received an education in the bullying methods of Palm Beach county officers. He was not permitted to see Goodrich, and was subjected to a specimen of third-degree questioning, as though he also had committed a crime in inquiring about the prisoner. Jones consulted counsel and finally secured the release of Mr. Goodrich after filing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a $500 bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now, fellow citizens of this land of the free and the brave, here is the climax of the story. For what purpose was Goodrich arrested? Why was he held in jail for several days and treated worse than is lawful for a desperate criminal to be treated? What charges were filed against him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On his release he inquired at the office of the prosecuting attorney of the criminal court of records and found that his case was not even on record. He found that no charge had been offered against him. His lawyer then investigated and was informed that it was not the intention of the county or the state to have his case heard at any time, or in any court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Roy Goodrich was not arrested and tortured for violating any law of the United States or of the State of Florida. He was arrested because he was engaged in the work of preaching the gospel of Almighty God to the people of Florida. There is only one organization on earth mean enough and cruel enough to resurrect the Inquisition and start it going in Florida or any other part of the United States. That organization is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Back of this particular incident you will find that organization prosecuting its program to Hitlerize and swastikaize America. Residents of Florida, wake up, and protect your liberties before they are completely gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Floggers and Murderers Get $50 Each</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font6">URDER is no longer popular in Tampa, since combinations of the employing interests, the KKK, the police and the underworld, brought about the terrible death of Mr. Shoemaker. Two of the witnesses of the Shoemaker fatal flogging have died suddenly. Whether they suicided or were murdered is not known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to newspaper stories the floggers and murderers of Joseph A. Shoemaker, at Tampa, did not do their ghastly butchery of their fellow man entirely as a labor of love for the lodge of which they were members, but were paid $50 each. The NRA went out of business before it had time to make up a regular scale of prices for this industry. Tampa prices are understood to be much higher than in Chicago or New York, but it is understood that some of the money went to grafters in between. However, in view of the fact that the murderers and floggers went out under the protection, advice and counsel of the mayor and the chief of police, they got enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For Proclaiming the Truth at Brownsville, Pa. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By T. A. McKnight</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HILE preaching the good news of God’s incoming glorious kingdom to the people of Brownsville, Pa., on Sunday morning, March 15, two women, two men and I were stopped and manhandled into the rear seat of an automobile and headed for the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were quite a sight to the people as we passed by, with the five of us in the rear and two policemen in front and one standing on the running board. I have often seen patrol wagons on their way to jail with occupants of disorderly houses caught in raids, and thought of the similarity of the situation, except that in this case the occupants of the ‘‘patrol”, instead of being disreputable characters, were God’s own “little ones”, whose sole purpose in coming to the town of Brownsville, at their own expense, was to “bind up the brokenhearted” and to “comfort them that mourn”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Pennsylvania less civilized than Florida</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Arriving at the station house we were so wedged together that when I stepped out of the car my ribs crackled as I took an ordinary breath of air. We were ordered into the station house, and I asked permission to call our counsel, but was refused. Again I asked, and again the officer refused. Some moments passed and at last the officer said we would have to pay a forfeit or be placed in a cell. On our informing him that we wanted to retain counsel first, he then permitted me to call, and immediately thereafter we were lodged in a cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">None of us had any fear of a cell, but, could we have envisioned the filth and vermin-laden condition of these cells into which we were thrown, none could have helped but shudder a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had some anticipation of what mental torture we would be called upon to bear, because we knew from the loud, boisterous and filthy language coming from the cell block that quite a few inmates were quartered there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Presently the officer said, “Come along.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">filed through the door into the cell block, and there before us was a sight that could be better described by comparing it with the hold of a Chinese pirate ship. There were three cells. In one were three inmates, and the center one held five, leaving the third one vacant for some of our party. One man and I were placed in the first one, already occupied by three, making five in all. The other man and the two women were placed together in the vacant cell. The cell size was approximately six by five feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were cramped terribly, as there was room enough on the bunk for only four to sit squeezed together; the other one had to stand up. In one corner of the cell more of the precious room was occupied by what appeared to be a cuspidor elevated on a pedestal, but upon inspection turned out to be a sink to wash in. I asked one of the inmates how one attracted the officer’s attention when one needed toilet facilities; and he pointed under the bunk, and there it was. To use it would necessitate that the other four rise and huddle as closely together as possible to permit the raising of the bunk, thereby exposing to view the dirtiest, most filthy contraption one could imagine. That was enough for us. We would wait as long as possible. The other inmates kept up a steady chatter of loud and sometimes very filthy talk. The realization that our own female friends were in an adjacent cell and that at any moment a new volume of immoral jibes would be let loose was very trying to us, and the more embarrassing to the women and the man who occupied the same cell. It must have been mental torture to them. Presently one of the officers came in and this man in the same cell with the women asked the whereabouts of the lavatory. Whereupon the officer, pointing under the bunk, stated that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">there were the only facilities available. Up to this point I had thought that this one officer was a pretty square fellow, that is, one who because of his superiors was doing only what he was told to do. But this incident forced me to change my mind. Here was one chance to give one of the Lord’s little ones a “cup of water”, as it were, and he showed himself up for what he was. I knew there were fairly respectable accommodations upstairs; but he refused even this small request, at the same time knowing that the one seeking this small favor was at the same time quartered with those of the opposite sex. The Lord reward him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The air in the place was stifling and permeated with cigarette smoke from those incarcerated therein, who smoked constantly. The floor was littered with filth and caked with tobacco spit. The occupants spat on the floor or the sink, whichever happened to be handier. I noticed some bedbugs crawling across the back of one of my cell mates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now and then some transients came in to look us over and make wisecracks. It reminded me of how we used to visit the zoological gardens and view the animals there. It so happened that some transients were permitted the facilities of the floor for sleeping quarters, and this particular spot was just in front of the cage where the women and man were confined. Presently one of the most dilapidated creatures one could ever expect to meet came in and was about to make his bed for the night; but one of the others, who beneath his seemingly benighted make-up appreciated the situation, finally persuaded him this was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were in the cell approximately four hours, being released about 5:30 p.m., after as harrowing an experience as could be imagined. How wonderful the fresh air felt as we walked out of that slimy hole! This, added to the fact that we had fulfilled the obligations of our consecration to the Most High, and the fact that He had given us the needed strength to do this, made it possible for us to rejoice that we were counted worthy to have the privilege of suffering for His name’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Extraordinary Coincidence in Tampa</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font6">Tampa, Fla., three hours after the grand J- jury had indicted the chief of police as an accessory in the flogging murder of Joseph Shoemaker, Robert P. Fariss, a neighbor of the chief, was found dead in his garage. A week ago he had given some information to the county solicitor. The local justice of the peace proclaimed it a suicide; his wife says it was a murder. In any event, it was an extraordinary coincidence. Manner of death was not stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems now that the murder of Joseph A. Shoemaker was planned long in advance. It dates from the time that, acting as an election inspector, he protested against one man’s casting 104 votes. He was thereafter warned to keep off the streets, and his brother was warned to get him out of town, as there was trouble ahead for him. The man who telephoned this message to Shoemaker's brother said that he was speaking for the Ku Klux Klan. Men dressed like Ku Klux Klan members tried to intimidate Jehovah’s witnesses when they recently preached the gospel at Griffin, Ga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Griffin’s Gallant City Manager</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS popularly supposed that the way a man treats women and children indicates his real manhood. When R. A. Drake, city manager of Griffin, Georgia, caused the arrest of 82 of Jehovah’s witnesses for daring to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom in his city, the 42 men were accorded the hospitality of the jail over night, but the 40 women were told to get out and shift for themselves, but be sure to be back at time of trial the next afternoon. This compelled them to stay up all night, as some did, or try to sleep in their automobiles. They were, so says the Atlanta </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Georgian,</span><span class="font6"> “locked out of jail” by G riffin’s gallant (?) city manager.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Legionnaires at Griffin</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">EGIONNAIRES at Griffin, Georgia, who kidnaped two of Jehovah’s witnesses and carried them several miles into the country, turned out to be not as bad as their clubs and sticks indicated. After the work was fully explained to them, they refrained from making any assault, obtained some of the books in the usual manner, took the witnesses back to the point where they had picked them up, and told them to let their consciences be their guide. The witnesses gave them a splendid testimony as to their purpose to be true to Jehovah God first, last and all the time, even though they should suffer violence and death at their hands. In due time Legionnaires of this type will probably turn on the Hierarchy, and then—?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVAH is the Creator and Giver of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He requires full obedience by all creatures who will receive life everlasting. Lucifer held a high position in God’s organization and because of his willful disobedience he became that wicked one, the Devil, and his end will be complete destruction. Adam was perfect and would have lived forever had he not willfully disobeyed God. Because of his sin, or disobedience, death came upon him and, through him, upon all mankind. (Bomans 5:12) God then announced His purpose to open the way for the redemption and salvation of men by and through Christ Jesus, but before Jesus became the Redeemer of man He must prove His complete obedience under the most severe test. Jesus obeyed and fully maintained His integrity toward God, and therefore it is written of Him that by reason of His full obedience God made Him the author of eternal salvation. (Hebrews 5: 8, 9) The way to life was then open to man, and now, contrasting the result of disobedience with that of obedience, the Scriptures, at Romans 5:19, say: “As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one [Christ Jesus] shall many be made righteous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Imperfection and death is upon man because of sin, and before anyone can be relieved of such disability he must believe on the Lord and obey Him. Belief means the learning that Jehovah is God, and Christ Jesus is the Savior of men, and then proving such belief by doing what God has commanded in His Word. The first step is consecration to God, meaning that the man agrees to do what God has commanded him to do. The Bible contains a full statement of God’s commandments, and by the Bible the man must now be guided. For that reason it is written that the Bible is man’s true guide. (Psalm 119:105) In order to know what is the truth man must study the Bible, together with such helps as the Lord has provided, and then follow the advice and commandment therein given. To all who have agreed to do the will of God He addresses this text (Proverbs 3: 5, 6): “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” No man or organization of men can set down the rules by which one must be guided. Performing ceremonies or going through forms prescribed by rituals will bring nothing good. Only the Lord’s Word is the true guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Micah 6:8 it is written: “0 man, . . . what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly [that is, obediently] with thy God ?” That means to deal justly with all and not to harm anyone. Love righteousness and hate wickedness and walk in the way that God leads, and do so humbly, that is, joyfully obedient unto the commandment of the Lord. When one learns the truth, as set forth in the Bible, his obligation to obey begins, as it is written (Psalm 18: 44): “As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.” All sane persons desire to be saved from death and to live in peace and happiness. The only way to receive such blessings is to be obedient to God’s commandment given to man through Christ Jesus. At Hebrews 5: 9 it is written that Christ Jesus is the author of salvation unto all them that obey Him. Those who fail or refuse to obey shall not receive the blessings of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to obey the Lord you must learn what is His will concerning man. On this point it is written, in Romans 10:14: ‘How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear unless someone tells them?’ God has therefore graciously provided witnesses to aid the people and has sent them forth to tell the people that Jehovah is God and Christ is King and the Savior of the world, and that those who would live must learn of God and Christ Jesus and be fully obedient to His law. Jehovah’s witnesses bring to you this message of truth in obedience to God’s commandment, and when you receive or hear this message the obligation is laid upon you to give heed to it and to obey the Lord rather than men. God will not force you to believe, but shows you that such is the only way to life. Those who receive the knowledge of the truth and then refuse to obey shall perish for ever. Those who receive the truth from the Lord and learn of His gracious provision for man are commanded to obey </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">telling the truth to others, and their failure so to do will result in their destruction, as it is stated in the Scriptures. (Acts 3:23; Ezek. 3:17) The great commandment of God, as given to man, is that he must love God with all his heart, mind and strength. It is written that we prove our love for God by joyfully obeying His commandments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Rutherford Heard in Albania </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Nicholas Christo (Massachusetts')</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">E WISH to inform you that from communications recently received from Albania Judge Rutherford’s speech on “Separating the Nations” was heard in that land, thus adding another country to the already long list of those that heard it. It was picked up at two different places that we have been informed of, apparently by shortwave transmission. It was heard by the friends themselves at one place, and by others than the friends at another. The friends were thrilled beyond expression at hearing Judge Rutherford’s voice, and since very few, if any, could understand, steps have been taken to have it sent to them translated in their tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover the above disproves the statement made by the reporter of the British publication called the Leed’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mercziry</span><span class="font6"> to the effect that the speech “will certainly not be heard” in Albania, because it “has no telephone service, either external or internal”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 431, page 401) The latter statement sounds incredible even on the face of it. To us it matters not how modernized a country is or is not—all peoples of all nations alike have need of the blessings of God’s kingdom—nevertheless it does not seem at all inappropriate to make an observation here with respect to Albania’s telephone service, and that based upon firsthand information. While it may not have a widespread telephone service, the fact is that Albania has an adequate telephone system linking up all its cities and larger towns, its prefectures with all their subdivisions, down to the smallest governmental units, Tirana, the capital, itself being the center of exchange. The service is accessible to all. What is more, instances have been known where telephone connections have been made with Vienna and Athens from Tirana. This is speaking of some years ago; doubtless progress may have been made of late along this line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Railroad service is what Albania lacks; she has aeroplane passenger transportation, however. Thus it is seen that Albania has external telephone connection as well. They say “Hello” there as they do here. (I nearly forgot to mention this.) Well, this ought to give Albania a boost, if it will not altogether put it on the map!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the way, someone suggested that this ought to be first-space* news for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> Come to think of it, Albania always stands at the top of the list even as America—alphabetically. [*AI1 O.K. So be it.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heard in India and South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">L</span><span class="font6">ETTERS at hand indicate that Judge Rutherford’s address “Separating the Nations” was heard from 1:30 to 2:30 a.m., Monday, February 24, at Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Khanewal (in the Punjab), Oorgaum (in the Kolar gold fields), Madanapalle (in South India), and Martaban (in Burma). One English pioneer party away in the wilds of the jungle picked up the speech quite well. In northern India a group of seven Hindus, though most of them did not understand English, were thrilled to hear Judge Rutherford’s voice. In South Africa he was heard at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Beaufort West, Kimberley, Vryburg, Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Pietersburg, Pietermaritzburg, Kranskop, and many other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Belated Reports of the Great Broadcast</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norway. Oslo: “We heard better this time than ever before. Attendance 162. It was very encouraging to hear Judge Rutherford. We rose and shouted ‘Aye’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sweden. Stockholm: “A little more than 100 persons were gathered at our hall to listen, and all shouted ‘Aye’ to the resolution proposed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font6">OT only (as previously published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age)</span><span class="font6"> was Judge Rutherford’s address “Separating the Nations” distinctly heard in Australasia from beginning to end, but several incidents mark the hand of God distinctly in connection with it. First is the fact, recorded by T. Kitto, chief engineer of the Airsales Broadcasting Company, that “engineers from the Postmaster General’s Department and the Amalgamated Wireless of Australia gave no hope of this rebroadcast being a success and even some personal friends said it would be hopeless. Summing up, the general opinion is that this is one of the best rebroadcasts we have ever experienced in Australia, if not the best from America, and, considering the time, certainly the most outstanding.” Second is the fact that when the broadcast was three-fourths over the beam was reversed, in accord with British practice, and was directed over the north pole and thus around the earth to Australia, and although this change was noticeable in the antipodes, yet the message came through all right, and finally (and this also was previously mentioned in these columns) the circuit was kept open just long enough to let the whole address come through and then Jehovah’s power was withdrawn; for when the Australian Post Office Department endeavored to report back to London on the reception of the broadcast, they could not get their report through, owing to the sudden complete failure of the circuit. All these things fill God’s people with joy, and must fill the Devil’s advocates with terror and dismay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">T HAND a few belated reports of the worldwide broadcast of Judge Rutherford’s address on “Separating the Nations”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dutch Guiana. Paramaribo: “Judge Rutherford’s lecture of February 23 was heard clearly at Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana, where many who are interested listened with great appreciation. Jehovah’s witnesses listened with delight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Germany. Baden: “The broadcast of February 23 was well received.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Java. Batavia Centrum: “On Monday morning, February 24, we were privileged to listen in to the great world broadcast, and were thrilled to hear the judge speaking from Los Angeles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New Zealand. Auckland: “It is with hearts full of thankfulness, and very thrilled, that we write to say that in far-away New Zealand we had the extraordinary pleasure to successfully receive the address of our dear Judge Rutherford today at 8 to 9 a.m., Summer Time, on ‘Separating the Nations’. Almost all the address was received clearly and even the deaf ones present heard much of it.” (20 signers) Dunedin: “I feel I must write to let you know the wonderful reception here of your much appreciated lecture, ‘Separating the Nations,’ which gives me great comfort. It could be heard on two places very plainly on our 8-valve Wurlitzer, set at loud speaker strength, with very little noise. I heard all the preliminary directions by the announcer at the radio telephone terminal in London, and later shifted down the dial to hear the lecture direct from America. This was remarkable, as we did not expect to hear the lecture at all at the time, 8 to 9 a.m. New Zealand Summer Time. The hour is too late, as a rule, for this location. The announcer mentioned every place but New Zea- </span><span class="font5"><sup>: </sup>land. My only regret is that I did not have the room full of people to hear the wonderful truths coming from your lips thousands of miles away. However, if the opportunity should ever come again, we will be prepared full strength. I am writing this report in the hope that it may help you to know how far in this direction your voice could be heard. We listen in every Sunday, after we come home from the meeting, to the lectures from Australia, but, of course, they are recorded, so it was more pleasing to hear you in person. We ourselves have a number of records which we put through our wireless. Though we were not at the Shrine Auditorium, our voices joined in the ‘Aye’ at the conclusion.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Northern Rhodesia. Ndola: “I had the privilege ■ of listening in last night and I must confess that we were greatly blessed to hear the great speech of convincing truths, under very unfavorable circumstances. ' Words fail to express the thrill which I got while lis- . tening. I had my head right in the machine, with the ; wires against my ears. This enabled me to follow word for word. It was a great and thrilling moment.” &lt;&nbsp;499</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Birthday Celebrations</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A SUBSCRIBER wants the facts on birthday celebrations. There are but two such celebrations mentioned in the Scriptures, one of the heathen king Pharaoh of Egypt, in the days of Joseph, and the other of that Herod the celebration of whose birthday cost John the Baptist his life. In the Bible there is no instance of celebrations of birthdays by any of God’s people, either His typical people or His actual people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses Smile at Their Critics</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford’s address on “Separating the Nations” was disturbing to some people. People who have not had an idea in years were forced to use their thinking apparatus. Here is a letter from a college professor in Tennessee. He mourns because he had purposed to spend an hour listening to music and was forced to listen to Judge Rutherford instead. It seems never to have occurred to him that his troubles would all have vanished by a twist of the dial. Probably the truth is that the lecture made him think, and this he did not wish to do. Another gentleman, a Catholic, takes up the gage of battle on behalf of his church. To his way of thinking “Catholic priests have never been found to withhold any truth from anyone, but rather they are quick at pointing out the truth.” The gentleman holds that the Bible is of secondary importance; the priests are the only “lawful interpreters”. The gentleman is in error, and a careful reading of the address which he heard should fully satisfy his mind on that point. Bernard Weeks, of Minneapolis, Catholic, shows his Catholic training by writing a radio station: “I do not demand the complete removal of Judge Rutherford, but I do demand that his future lectures be censored.” Mr. Weeks neglects to say that what he desires is that Judge Rutherford should submit all his lectures to some priest, to be blue-penciled, before they go out on the air. If Christ were to return in the flesh, Catholics would expect Him to do the same. They would argue that a priest who has power enough to order Christ to leave His heavenly throne and come down to earth to be sacrificed afresh at his hands, ought surely to have enough authority to censor His addresses. A Lutheran minister agrees with everything Judge Rutherford said about Catholic doctrine, but seems to agree with nothing else. However, to his credit, he does agree on American freedom of speech to express ideas which he, as a dominie, does not endorse. All O.K. Probably the dominie, when he preaches, also expresses some ideas which Judge Rutherford would not endorse, but the judge would let him say his say; so the situation between the two men is fifty-fifty. Mrs. Larson, of the same city, said: “Are your words greater than those of the pope? Words; idle words. We want proof. Get off the air.” Not so fast, Mrs. Larson. Yes, Judge Rutherford’s words are much, very much, greater than those of any pope, because they are the words of God from </span><span class="font6">His Word. You will never get the proofs which you refuse to examine. As to getting off the air, you Catholics really want Judge Rutherford to get off the earth and get out of the solar system, and out of this particular star cloud, and out of the universe, and let your folks have it all. You are riding for a fall. Mr. Sleddy, of Philadelphia, says he refuses to listen to any more “sutch” programs. That is just too bad, for Mr. Sleddy. He discloses parochial-school spelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J. H. Baker, Monrovia, California, protests against Judge Rutherford’s use of the air. He objects to what he terms a base “inferrance” by one he deems a “mutelater” of the truth. He thinks such addresses “frought” with danger to society. He objects to “glamerous” nonsense. He opines that “Pharesees” were a sect the same as the “Babtists” and declares that Judge Rutherford’s “electricly” transcribed radio speech will be protested. Mr. Baker is handicapped by his parochial school education. He acknowledges that he has been a Catholic nearly 70 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Referring to Judge Rutherford’s address on “Separating the Nations”, Mr. B. J. Cullen, of Denver, Colorado, said: “Even if his remarks were true, such programs as this must be kept off the air.” That is the true spirit of the Inquisition. Great multitudes consider that the judge’s most powerful address, and of greatest importance to his fellow men. Mary Rainsford, of Philadelphia, threatened, “I, for one, will never tune in again on WIP.” Mary, Mary; that is like the Irishman who shook hands with Edward VII, Idng of England, and in the king’s presence solemnly declared that he would never wash that hand again as long as he lived. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Clifford, of Newportville, Pennsylvania, wrote a radio station, “I [Mrs. Clifford] thought speeches were censored before they were put on the air.” She admits (for herself and her hubby) that they are Catholics, and proud of it. Poor soul! the very fact that she wants some priest to read Judge Rutherford’s talk before it should be put on the air would tell anybody clearly enough that she is not an American, but a subject of the pope. Sometime the thing of which she is now proud will be to her a cause of shame. Mr. R. R. Dutton’s wife, of Philadelphia, thinks: “Instead of being permitted radio facilities he and his cohorts should be in jail, not for their religious activities, which are misleading enough, but for their absolute lies against the Catholic church and their dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">respect for our country’s flag.” Mrs. Dutton (using her husband’s name) calls Judge Rutherford by the gentle and Christlike names “bigot”, “falsifier” and “moron”, thus indicating her training. Poor soul! she does not know that she cannot be a true American and at the same time be (quote her own words) a “bigot and falsifier”, a Catholic. Mrs. Tom. Finnegan, of La Center, Washington, was woman enough to use her own name and showed her Irish wit all through it. She made it clear six times in her letter that she was what she termed of “Catcholic” faith. Surely, and you can bet she was “educated” in a parochial school. Going after the judge she said [sic]: “A lot of our ancestors left Ireland because they would be killed by a certain government if their faith was Catcholic, and in the oath of the King of England he has to swear he’ll never marry a Catcholic. Of course that would be a disgrace. Bad cess to the whole of them. I woudn’t wipe me boots with Judge Rutherford or any King or Queen, because I’d be afraid they would turn me into a banshee or some kind of a leprechaun.” (A banshee is a female ghost, and a leprechaun a male one.) Mrs. George Schraeder, St. Marys, Kansas, says she is of the Roman Catholic “religion” and [sic] “if I could of reach that santins agent sunday through the radio I would of punched his nose in for making such remarks about catholic priest, for the most of them are living saints they dont bother other religons. why do others bother them, because they are Jealous”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">F THEY knew what they were about, the last persons on this earth that the K.K.K. would molest or seek to terrify are Jehovah’s witnesses ; and if they do not know it, now would be a good time to find out. Jehovah’s witnesses make no bones of the fact that they are in a fight against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Is the Hierarchy so clever that it can get the K.K.K. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to fight on</span><span class="font6"> its side, and fight against those who are valiantly standing on the very ground where the K.K.K. is popularly supposed to stand? It seems so. How else can one explain the action of 26 cars of K.K.K. coming to the Griffin camp of Jehovah’s witnesses, jumping out of their cars, four to each car, and all in full regalia, and marching silently past two men, two women and one little boy, frightening one of the women so that next day she was unable to be about? Further, thirty minutes later the same performance was gone through again. If that is the real attitude of the K.K.K., then the quicker they disband and become true Americans, the better it will be for the country. At Griffin the K.K.K. made monkeys of themselves and of their order, and all of the men and most of the women of Jehovah’s witnesses only laughed at them for their folly and their ridiculous costumes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The official that gave us the permits to use the three sound cars was Protestant. On Sunday he was sick in bed; so the Catholic city manager was on the job. The Tampa ear was giving the Kingdom message when the doors of a Catholic church in the neighborhood opened wide and the city manager came running out, followed by six Catholic priests, all dressed in black skirts. The priests shook their fists at Jehovah’s witnesses and shouted to the city manager to run them out of the city. The manager told the sound-car operator to put on a record; he wanted to hear what it was like. The operator, alert to his opportunity, put on the record “Fathers”. The church was full of people. It was the chance of a lifetime. You know the part where it says, “And call no man on earth your father.” Well, those ‘old gals’ took hold of their skirts and jumped right up and down. The city manager shrieked “Stop that record!” A bystander, a stranger, manifestly a lover of justice, but most unwise, expostulated. Somebody struck him in the face and knocked him down. There was a fight. He, and the operator of the car, were taken to the station, and dismissed. The sound car had only two minutes to go before the two hours were up, but the police and priests were so glad to get rid of Jehovah’s witnesses, and were so excited, that they gave the three operators back their permit money, $30 for the three cars. One comical incident was the sheriff’s sitting on a stone wall waiting for the sound cars to eome along, so he could make a $10 refund. A fourth car was outside the city; its driver knew nothing of what had taken place; he was on his way back to headquarters. The sheriff saw him coming, jumped up from the stone wall and commanded him to stop, which he did; he then demanded that he take $10 and get out of town. He refused to accept it, of course, but the officials were so excited, and glad to be rid of Jehovah ’s witnesses, that they would gladly have paid back $40 in place of the $30 paid for permits. A fine time was had by all, except the stranger that got knocked down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A number of the prisoners in the Sachsenburg belong to the sect known as the “Ernste Bibelforscher ”, who are, perhaps, the most pitiful victims of religious persecution in Germany. They preach and practice a kind of primitive Christianity, holding communion services and going from door to door expounding the Gospels. Many of them have been arrested; the “mass trial” of “Bibelforscher” at Elberfeld was reported in the Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> recently. A branch of the sect calls itself “witnesses of Jehovah”. They refuse to say “Hail Hitler”, alleging that to do so is sacrilegious, the Deity alone being entitled to this expression of reverence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several “witnesses of Jehovah” are in the Sachsenburg. One of them, whenever he was ordered to say “Hail Hitler!” would reply: “There is only one God, and He is Jehovah.” He was flogged, but refused to submit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another “witness” broke down under the flogging, which was so severe that several of the onlookers fainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another “witness” was flogged in the Sachsenburg on December 12, 1935. After eighteen lashes he began to whimper. But the flogging went on until he lost consciousness.</span></p>

The bishops issued a letter in which they covertly hinted that “it is possible, however, for the candlestick of the faith to be removed from individual countries which prove wanting in the hour of trial”. That is to say, if the bishops don’t walk the chalk line they may have to shut up shop. The partnership is a galling one. The bishops invite their flock to “pray for all that are in authority”, by which they mean Hitler and his gang, instead of Christ Jesus, the Father’s choice, Him to whom has been committed all rightful power in heaven and in earth. That came out one day, and the very same paper, the very next day, tells of seven monks’ being sent to the penitentiary, one of them for over six years, for working against the Hitler government by sending money out of the country. What the bishops meant when they invited their flocks to pray for Hitler and his crowd was that they should pray that when they do something crooked they might not get caught at it. The bishops advised the flock that as they now have to fill their religious papers with Hitler’s bunk, the flock would do just as well, under the circumstances, to read the Bible instead. How very true! A good thing to read first would be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">twenty-third chapter of Matthew.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Idiosyncrasy to Aluminum?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N VIEW of the recent investigation by the Ministry of Health into the question of aluminum cooking utensils, and the note on the Ministry’s report published in your issue of November 2, I feel that the following case should provide food for thought for any who may chance to read this letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A female patient, aged 36, had for some ten years or more suffered from definite symptoms, chief among which were periodic attacks of vomiting and diarrhea with generalized abdominal pain, continual anorexia, with lassitude and general depression, her weight being in the region of 7 stone [98 pounds], and she also suffered from boils. During three years, as possible sources of focal infection, she had her tonsils, appendix, and gall bladder removed, and her teeth completely overhauled—all with no improvement whatsoever. In the summer of 1933, when she was almost on the point of giving up her work on account of her chronic ill-health, she was persuaded by a non-medical friend to give up using aluminum cooking vessels, with the result that during the following twelve months she was entirely free from any symptoms whatever, and put on over 2 stone [28 pounds] in weight. (This, obviously, might have been due to the psychological effect of “trying something new”, but, in view of what follows, I think not.) In the summer of 1934 the patient had two weeks’ holiday, the first week being spent at a hotel in Cornwall, and the second at a hotel in South Devon. During the first week she was ill the whole time, her symptoms being much the same as before—vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lassitude, and depression—and she began to wish she had not taken a holiday. The possibility of aluminum poisoning apparently did not enter her head at the time. However, after two days at the second hotel she recovered, and at the end of the fortnight felt very much better for her holiday. The hotels, incidentally, were at much the same standard as regarded general comfort, cleanliness, and food, both being marked with three stars in the A.A. handbook. About a month later the question of aluminum suddenly occurred to her as a possible cause of the illness, and she wrote to both hotels, asking what proportion of their cooking, if any, was done in aluminum vessels, and received the following interesting replies: that at the first hotel, where she had been ill the whole time, aluminum cooking vessels were used for all the cooking, and that at the second hotel no aluminum vessels were used at all. Some six months later the same patient spent a week-end at a ladies’ club in London, and when she returned was completely incapacitated for her work for two days, with exactly the same symptoms as before, and a letter to the club elicited the information that a large proportion of their cooking vessels were of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These facts surely cannot be explained on a psychological basis, and personally I feel very strongly that the last word on this subject has definitely not been said. “The Ministry says that aluminum is safe”—possibly it is—for the vast majority of us, but if so, then the above case is obviously one of idiosyncrasy; and where there is one case of idiosyncrasy there must surely be hundreds, if not thousands, of others among the vast army of chronic dyspeptics that fill every consulting room in the country. I would suggest, therefore, Ministry of Health or no, that the discarding of aluminum cooking utensils by these patients is a line of treatment which is at least worthy of a trial.—E. J. Dennison, M.B., B.S., in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">British Medical Journal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21st Radium-Poisoning Victim</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE twenty-first radium-poisoning victim has just died, leaving her husband and two sons. Like the other victims, she was an employee of the United States Radium Corporation, and got the radium into her system by such an apparently harmless method as moistening her radiumpaint brush with her lips. She sued for $200,000, but the case was settled out of court for $10,000. Her two sons are practically certain to go the way of the mother unless a remedy for the progress of radium disease is found. Studies in this direction are being carried on at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where methods of gradually removing radium from the human body are being considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Automobile Door Handle Driven into Brain</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">X New York city an eight-year-old lad, on the way to a movie, was hit by an automobile and the door handle was driven into his skull above the left ear by the force of the impact. Nevertheless, the handle was removed, an operation was performed at once, and the boy is getting well. Temporary paralysis of the tongue, the left eyelid and the right lower part of the face have disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Disobedience Reverses the Creative Process</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">NSTEAD of saying “Disobedience reverses the creative process”, it would be quite as accurate to say “Disobedience causes decay and death”; but it suits best, for this little discussion, to ponder somewhat on the creation of man and what happened when he disobeyed. The following are some selections from Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font6"> tvhich are apropos:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attributes of God, which are inherent in him, are, to wit: wisdom, justice, love and power, all operating in equal and exact balance. . . . Even the imperfect man w’hom we now see has some wisdom, some justice, some love, and some power. ... It therefore must be that man was made in the image and likeness of God in this respect, to wit: that he was endowed with wisdom, justice, love and power. . . . Jehovah furnished the plans and specifications for the building of the first man. Marvelous wisdom is displayed in those plans. . . . Then the Logos proceeded to execute those plans to build man according to the specifications.—Pages 49, 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can it be said then that the creation of man was a failure? So far as man is concerned, Yes; so far as God is concerned, No. Had man been obedient to God, in due time the earth would have been filled with a race of perfect creatures. . . . God’s purpose concerning man was in no respect a failure. ... It is manifest that God would have found more pleasure in the full obedience of man to his law; but the fact that his creatures have disobeyed his law in no wise argues against the wisdom of his creation or of his purpose relating to creation.—Page 126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very greatest privilege that can come to any creature is to know God and to love Him, and to be known by and loved by Him. This was what sustained Jesus throughout His ministry. He could say to His disciples, “I have meat to eat that ye know not of,” and then could explain: “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.”—John 4: 32, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every -worth-while person in the world likes to feel that he can be trusted in the performance of a duty. Why, even a dog has the same sense of appreciation of confidence justly placed. Thus there is on record a credible story of a man who confided to a neighbor that he must be gone for a night and leave his -wife alone in the house with a considerable sum of money in her care; and would the neighbor let his dog stay in the kitchen and watch over the house during the night? The neighbor agreed, and loaned the dog. In the morning he was found dead in the room where he had left the dog. The window was open. The dog’s teeth had severed his jugular vein. The dog was true to his trust; when the false neighbor had come in the night to rob the one who trusted him, the dog sensed the situation and placed his honor as a faithful dog on a higher level than love of master.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Companionship with God</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Returning to the subject: Man was made to get his highest happiness from his contacts with his Creator, and the best men and women that have ever walked on earth have found their chief joys in that very way. The great Jehovah God made every provision that this want should be met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Consider the significance of the statement to Abraham, “I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.” (Genesis 15:1) Throughout his lifetime, Abraham had that perfect shield from anything that could harm his eternal interests, but he had much, very much more. He had the reward in his heart that he was accounted worthy to be the friend of God, even to the point of giving up the dearest treasure of his soul, for a testimony to all who should thereafter believe on God and thus be His children by faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But hold! This reward of companionship with God will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font6"> be his. When his nap is over (and his sleep in death is but for a moment, as God counts time) he will awake to the everlasting joy of the friendship which now watches over his interests, and will forever watch. This thing that Abraham was created to have is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his. </span><span class="font6">Nothing can ever take it away from him. It is inalienable. “To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not pass over this point quickly. Take time to consider it. Consider Cain for a moment. For following in Lucifer’s steps, and becoming a man-killer, he not only lost the brother whose life he had taken, but was declared a fugitive and vagabond, thus .being cut off from all the rest of the human family (except for the one sister that clung to him and became his companion in exile, his wife).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But when Cain expressed his distress at the punishment justly pronounced upon him, it is noteworthy, his first utterance was that of grief that he could no longer enjoy the companionship which he now remembered as the sweetest thing in life. His words, as recorded in Scripture, are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the [inhabited] earth; and from thy face shall I be hid. ’ ’ —Genesis 4:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most serious, indeed, was the penalty pronounced upon Cain. The Scriptures do, it is true, keep sight of him for five generations thereafter, but there is not a person in the world of whom it can be said that he is a descendant of Cain. Every one of his posterity was lost in the Flood. All the world are descendants of faithful and obedient Noah.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Jehovah for an Inheritance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Aaron the high priest was to have no inheritance in the land of Canaan. Jehovah promised that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font6"> would be his inheritance. All the treasures of grace divine should be his. (Numbers 18:20) The same promise was extended to the tribe of Levi. (Deuteronomy 10:9) And the same promise is extended to those whom the Levites represented: “I am their inheritance; ... I am their possession.”—Ezekiel 44: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What does anything in this world matter, if one has Jehovah God for his friend&quot;? Nothing at all. All his troubles, whatever they may be, are transient. As the apostle declared, they are “but for a moment’&quot;' (2 Corinthians 4:17), and when they are over there is the unchangeable Friend, with all the wealth of infinite wisdom, justice, love and power, waiting to lift up and bless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what does it matter if one has everything this world can give and does not have Jehovah God for his Friend? Just this: In a few short years he will be dead. All his empty honors will have rusted out, and all his possessions will be in the hands of others, perhaps to their injury. And but for the grace of God there is nothing ahead but a jump into the black chasm of eternal night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It really means something when it says that “Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah”. (Genesis 4:16) He knew better than to take the life of his brother, and to lie about the deed after it was done. And so he was expelled from the presence of Jehovah God, the One that might have been his eternal Friend. Jehovah God does not want murderers and liars for friends. Those that take such a course must feel the weight of His disapproval, and it is, indeed, a punishment greater than they can bear.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Cain a Vagabond and Fugitive</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">God forbade anybody to execute Cain, but did not leave him happy. He permitted him to live </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font6">for a time as an exile, or convict. The land which he tilled was to be only partly productive. ‘When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.”— Genesis 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is some doubt as to just the significance of Cain’s succeeding statement. While the marginal reading of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font6"> indicates the thought may be, “Mine iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven”; and one learned Hebrew scholar thinks it should be, “Is mine iniquity too great to be forgiven?” the facts agree with the Common Version text just as it reads, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is the meaning of this ? Just this: That Jehovah God thenceforth held him at arm’s length, and held him there until he finally, and gradually, over centuries, no doubt, wasted away and died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the years stretched into decades, and the decades into centuries, hope would wither and shrivel, along with all his other powers, but Cain's first great loss was when that organ which phrenologists, for want of a better name, call “spirituality”, that is, spiritual-mindedness, was dwarfed the day he assented to murder and was expelled from the presence of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a very important sense Cain began to turn to the dust that day. He could not turn the other way. Contact was either completely cut off or greatly restricted. Happiness was gone. Death was surely on the way.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>The Dwarfing of the Faculties</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The dwarfing of the faculties of man has been one of the most terrible effects of the fall. The perfect man, as exemplified in Jesus, had perfect veneration for that which was worthy of veneration, and no veneration at all for that which was not worthy of it. He venerated Jehovah God and His Word of Truth. All around Him were humans that venerated the traditions of men. Their veneration was lopsided; their minds were dying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was supremely benevolent. One statement has it that “Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd”. (Mark 6:34) The Greek text indicates that this compassion was accompanied with a trembling of the abdomen, as of one under great tension. He had compassion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">enough on these poor people that he was willing to die for them, and did die for them, but all around Him were potential murderers; a very-considerable number were so nearly dead mentally that they were ready, at slight provocation, to cry out for the death by crucifixion of One who had done things for them no other had ever done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was supremely conscientious. He could truthfully say of His relations toward God, “I do always those things that please him” and, fifteen verses farther on in the same chapter, could describe the condition of many of His hearers by saying to them, “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ve will do.”—John 8:29,44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so one could go over all the various faculties that go to make up man, and see what happened as a result of the disobedience of our first parents. The whole human family is askew.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>How to Test It Out</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">If one doubts this, let him get out in the preaching of the gospel from door to door. Some fight the truth, which is their best friend, as though it were their worst enemy. Some are so bent on destruction that they wish to kill those who tell them of the good news that a new and perfect Ruler is here. Some indicate that their principal interest in life is getting something to eat. Others have no time to listen to the message of the Kingdom; they cannot take a minute from children, or wife or husband, or whatever it is that occupies the stage in their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some had no caution at all about swallowing the doctrines of “purgatory” and “eternal torture”, but view with the greatest alarm anything that shows they are untrue. Some fear to investigate, fear what the neighbors or relatives will say, and some knew everything when they were born, have learned nothing since, and defy anybody ever to teach them anything. Some are not interested in anything unless it will teach them how to make money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some cannot concentrate on what is brought to their attention, and some cannot stick to the truth even when they get it. Some are so secretive that they do not wish to say anything about it. Some cannot let God’s work be done in His way, but want to do it in their way. Some are too firm, and some not firm enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet, despite six thousand years of falling away from the Divine likeness, there is a vast deal of good yet left in the human family as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">whole, and, sandwiched in here and there among those who are blinded by the great adversary, there are some who wish to know about God, some who regret their present unhappy condition, and some who hail with joy the advent of the better day when the breaking-down process will be at an end and the regeneration will be in order and be a fact. That time is near at hand. Armageddon will mark the full end of Satan’s pow<sup>y</sup>er to deceive and mislead and ruin and destroy the human family. The power of the new King will light the fires of devotion to Jehovah God in every human heart that wishes to do right and, wishing to do right, will lay hold on eternal life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N New England 250 years ago Quakers were tortured by having holes bored through their tongues, their ears cut off, whipped twice a week for two months until they had received 350 lashes, and in one instance a wife and daughter were stripped to the waist, tied to the tail of an oxcart and marched 80 miles, through 11 towns, and whipped in each town until the blood ran.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">OME idea of the capacity of mankind to make fools of themselves may be gathered from the following inscription in Asia Minor commemorating the birthday of Augustus: “This day has given the earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have gone to destruction had there not streamed forth from him who is born a common blessing. The providence which rules over all has filled this man with such gifts for the salvation of the world as designate him the Savior of us and for future generations. By his appearing the hopes of our forefathers are fulfilled. The birthday of God has brought to the earth good tidings that are bound up in him. From his birthday a new era begins.” Doesn’t that sound like some “Heil Hitler” ass?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Excitement in a Restaurant </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Willobey Zellner </span><span class="font6">Scene: A small restaurant. Time: The present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">S THE scene opens several male customers are seated at the counter. Tony, an Italian, is looking over the morning menu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clerk: “Hey, Tony, what do you think of our country by this time?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tony: “Ha, ha! The-a presidents he say he-a do the Americans people for-a all he-a can.” [A roar.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clerk: “No, no, Tony. You've got the cart before the jackass. The president said he’s doing all he can for the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Customer: “Right you are, Joe, but the president has again demonstrated his liking for his alphabetic noodle soup. True, he said he’s doing all he can for the people, but his course of action proves he has again used the alphabet too freely. Had he omitted only two letters in the word ‘people’ he would have told the truth. He is doing all he can for the ‘people’, minus the first ‘e’ and the T—meaning he’s doing all he can for the pope —pope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clerk: “What’s this country coming to, anyway&quot;? Has old Uncle Sammy become Uncle Tamm’y?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Customer: “AVell, Joe, it appears to be just about that. But time will tell. I’ve always said those fellows in Washington can’t dine on that alphabetic noodle soup forever without its breaking out sometime.” [Laughter.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Door opens. Newsboy enters. “Paper, Mister? Paper, Mister? All about the terrible epidemic in Washington, D.C. Political Washington frantic. Capital Hill under quarantine. White House in panic. President loses head. Postmaster General busted his rosary. Vatican City shocked. Pope loses crucifix. Uses profanity. Greenback Serum Company experts working day and night with the hope of finding a new serum for sufferers. Doctors of Supreme Court suggest the knife.—Paper, Mister? Paper —”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Joe buys paper; reads: “Washington, D.C. — An unexpected epidemic broke out in the political circle here that threatens to eclipse all previous epidemics of the national capital. Smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and even the flu, were mild in comparison. This terrible, unprecedented, far-reaching and deeply seated malady was pronounced by Professors Holio Sapolro, I.H.S. (International Harem Society), and Helli Flabelli, S.I.G. (Society International Gogites), as ‘alphabeticum noodleitis’. The learned men claim it is somewhat similar to what in old cows is known as ‘impaction’, and is the result of gorging and lack of exercise. The lust-rious professors stated that the Washington epidemic was brought on by overindulging in alphabetic noodle soup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Greenback Serum Company is ‘hell bent’ on finding the necessary serum, since Washington’s political population dislikes a change of diet and is fearful of an operation. The professors have found the noodles to have been cooked in a ‘Mellono alumino’ pot, and decided it was a very wise thing to do, since the ‘alumino’ poison saved the lives of the patients by counteracting the ‘alphabeticum’ poison. The Greenback Serum Company has so far tested calf, heifer, cow and bull pus; pig, shoat, gilt, sow and boar pus; ram, lamb, sheep and mutton pus; pup, cur, feist, hound and dog pus; colt, mare, horse, stallion and jackass pus; but all without success thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Prominent Republicans offered G.O.P. elephant pus, but the Democrats were reluctant about accepting the offer. One of the latter party’s big men suggested the eagle pus. But that suggestion came just a little late, for the eagle had turned blue with mortification, and has since died. The postoffice department at Washington was so flooded with letters of sympathy that the postmaster general busted his blessed rosary, scattering the sacred beads into the very midst of the deluge of mail pouring in at times. And was he mad!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Pope Piecrust sent a message of sympathy and blessing as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘Son-a you-a sick in you-a bella;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hopa you soon get-a wella So-a you won’t-a go to hella.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The telegram was read with much feeling, since it came from ‘the forgotten man’—the ‘feeble old man’ Ambrosio Rotto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When ‘Papa’ read the sad news from Washington it affected him so awfully that he mislaid his crucifix. He was so excited that he actually shouted ‘Damn!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Cardinals were crestfallen. Beeshops drooped their horns. Shrouds and lingerie, fuss and flabelli es fluttered everywhere. It was an awful sight. Old Cardinal Diagonis was so exhausted that he fell headlong into the holy water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All was bedlam at the White House when word was received that the doctors of the Supreme Court ordered the knife. The president lost his head. He rushed out to the barn and began clubbing Jefferson’s jackass. But the doctors of the Supreme Court soon arrived on the scene and the cutting began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The shrouded and hooded nurses declared it was ‘head-splitting-’ to witness the NBA’s and AAA’s, etc., gush out. The doctors declared they never could have been digested, because they were against the constitution. They commended the nurses for having the heads so firmly bandaged, explaining that, should their bald heads burst it would have meant a terrible mixture of spaghetti and noodles. The floor was literally strewn with doughy letters. Further operations are planned for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The doctors marveled at the number of A’s that were removed. The nurses explained that this was due to the fact that a party by the name of ‘Ambrose’ operates the noodle factory. It is hoped that more will be learned as further operations are performed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Catholics Do Not [?] Believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE Catholic Laymen’s Association of Georgia gives a list of things which Catholics are not supposed to believe. Among other things, they do not believe that the pope is God [How remarkable!]; that the pope cannot do wrong; that the pope has temporal rights in America [but should have]; that the pope can claim their political allegiance [Oh, no?]; that the pope can nullify laws, oaths or contracts at will [Since when?]. They do not believe [says the ad] that the marriages of Protestants are invalid [But, just the same, they are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font6"> valid, according to Catholicism.]; that contracts with Protestants may be broken [My, my!]; that Protestants may be hated or persecuted [How about Jehovah’s witnesses’]; that public schools are an evil [!!!]; that they can buy forgiveness of sin [Oh, of course not.] ; that images may be worshiped [Nay, nay, Horatio.]; that anybody or anything may be worshiped or adored “in the heavens above, or in the earth below, or the waters beneath the earth’’, but the one true God. So, it would seem that all Catholics have to do now is to find out </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font6"> the one true God is, and what </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font6"> requires of them, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font6"> He commands men to worship Him. It doesn’t go to say that one believes in God when that one goes directly contrary to His plainest commandment.</span></p>

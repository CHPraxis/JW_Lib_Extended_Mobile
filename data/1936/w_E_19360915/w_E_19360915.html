<p><span class="font4">&quot;Zn </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">that day it shall he said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH caused his prophets to write aforetime concerning the things that must come to pass in this day, that is to say, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font4">day of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These prophecies he now unfolds for the aid, comfort and hope of the faithful remnant. (Rom. 15:4) The elect remnant sec this clearly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">will refuse to be turned aside or caused to become negligent by any trick the Devil may put forth. The remnant trust in the Lord and acknowledge him in all their ways and therefore have the full assurance that God is directing their pathway. Some ambitious and covetous man, wise in his own conceits and desiring others to think him learned and wise, now says: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">contains only the opinion of a man, and what is slated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is childish reasoning.” The purpose of such statements is to prejudice others against </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and turn their attention to the selfconceited &quot;wise” man. But the faithful remnant know that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are their Teachers, and that they are not being taught by the opinion of any man, and they refuse to follow a cunningly devised and uttered speech of an ambitious man. As every ox knows his master’s crib, so </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font4">one of Jehovah’s little ones knows that their spiritual food comes from their Father’s treasure house. They will study the prophecies and receive the unfolding thereof from the Lord with great joy and satisfaction and will give all praise to the heavenly Father and to the Greater Joshua.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Those of honest heart who have sat at the feet of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy, and listened to the twaddle of those selfish men, have been robbed of their just rights and have been deceived and kept in the dark, and now by the grace of the Lord the time has come for their mental understanding to be enlightened and they are seeing that help for them can come only from Jehovah God, by and through Christ Jesus. Note how well Jehovah long ago pictured this very part of his work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ As God directed the Gibeonites to turn to Joshua, so now the Lord directs those of honest heart to turn to Christ Jesus: ‘‘And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amontes that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.”—Josh. 10:6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Joshua was encamped with his army at Gilgal, which name means ‘‘rolling”, and signifies the place where the ‘‘reproach of Egypt” (which reproach was due to worldlincss) had been rolled off Jehovah’s people by the circumcision of the people of Israel. Jehovah rolled away such reproach from them because they obeyed his commandments to cleanse themselves before celebrating the memorial. (Josh. 5: 2-9) Likewise God rolled away the reproach of the world from his faithful remnant because they have obeyed his commandments to completely separate themselves from the world and to wholly devote themselves to Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">'’As the Gibeonites appealed to Joshua for help, so now the Jonadabs or the great multitude see that Jehovah’s witnesses are wholly devoted to God; and, needing help, they apply to .Jehovah’s witnesses to bring to them food that is necessary for their sustenance, protection and life. The appeal of the Gibeonites to Joshua corresponds to the people of good will who ciy unto Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, to deliver them from the abominations of ‘‘Christendom” in order that the people of good will may be preserved unto God. (Ezek. 9:4) Now Jehovah’s instruction to his witnesses is so plain and unequivocal that there is no excuse to misunderstand the same. The remnant must obey by carrying the message of the kingdom to all who are hungering for and seeking to know the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The cry of the Gibeonites to Joshua was: ‘‘Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us.” This part of the picture clearly shows that the work in behalf of the great multitude is opposed by the combined efforts of the conspirators, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, all of whom are acting under the command of Gog, the chief officer of the Devil, and that it is to the remnant under the command of the Greater Joshua that God has assigned the work of carrying the fruits of the kingdom to the great multitude and that Jehovah’s witnesses must be diligent in obeying this commandment. “ Jerusalem” is a name of Jehovah’s organization, which gives praise to the Lord, and those of the great multitude praise Jehovah saying: &quot;Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:10) As the Gibeonites of old were besieged by the enemy, so the modern-day Gibeonites, the people of good will, are besieged by the enemies of God’s organization; and for the encouragement of the people of good will who are seeking to serve and worship Jehovah he says, &quot;Fear thou not” the enemy; and likewise Jehovah says to the remnant of Zion, who are of his capital organization under the Greater Joshua: ‘Fear not the enemy’; and furthermore adds the command to the remnant: &quot;Let not thine hands be slack.” (Zeph. 3:16) That does not sound at all like waiting for a more favorable time to carry the message of the kingdom to the great multitude, as self-constituted &quot;wise men” advise. On the contrary, it shows that the work of the remnant now must be done with all diligence and without any letting up. It is now a war between the remnant and the enemies of God, and the weapon which must now be used by the remnant in this warfare is the &quot;sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God”, and which they must use by bohllj- and fearlessly declaring the kingdom message of truth. When is that work to be done? Shall it be done now or later? Je-hoxah answers by his prophet, It shall be done &quot;in that day”, that is, the day of Jehovah, when the Lord Jesus is at the temple separating the nations. It is now, at the present time, that the &quot;other sheep” of the Lord must have an opportunity to hear the truth and must take advantage of that opportunity and prove themselves for God and for his kingdom.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">2 75</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ There is no excuse for the remnant to be entrapped now by the Devil, and we have the assurance that the elect will not be entrapped. We arc fully warned concerning the wily foe, and &quot;we are not ignorant of his devices”. (2 Cor. 2:11) Those who are now on the alert well know that 1 he Devil is trying every possible means to defeat and nullify the work of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. The remnant are the &quot;children of light” and must be on the alert, walking in the light and doing as commanded: &quot;Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.”—1 Thcss. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Joshua fully appreciated the fact that he was in the midst of the enemy and that the Gibeonites were the only people of that land that had shown a disposition to be friendly with the Israelites. He could not wait until the confederate armies had destroyed Gib-con, but must act without delay: &quot;So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.”—Josh. 10:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Joshua, who stands for Jesus, there set the proper guide and rules of action for the remnant, that they must move with swiftness and be always on the alert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There God showed plainly that the work in behalf of the antitypical Gibeonites, the great multitude, must be done quickly and without slacking the hand. This work the Lord defines in another place as marking them in the foreheads, and of reaching out the hand to take them into Jehovah’s chariot or organization. That work must be done quickly and not be permitted to slow down. (2 Ki. 10:15; Ezck. 9:4) In order to be diligent and watchful the remnant must be on the lookout for the movements of the enemy that would tend to entrap the remnant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> This hypothetical case is here stated to illustrate the point. One who has been for years in the service of the Society and frequently addresses companies of God’s people from the platform, and who has read what the Watch Tower publications have to say concerning the great multitude and the prisoners, and the cities of refuge, speaks scornfully of all these published statements concerning the prophecies and sa.y^: &quot;That is childish reasoning; the real work of the great multitude wdl be some twenty years in the future, and not now; the statements in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> are the mere opinion of a man, and what is said about prophecy is childish reasoning, and what we need now is to get understanding, and then get ready for the woik later on. ” What would be the tendency of such speech </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font4">The effect on those who give heed thereto would be to cause them to slack the hand, to cease to fairy the kingdom message to the people now, to sit down and be al ease, and to watch for a ‘more favorable’ time. All who are hunting for an excuse to cease their work' would seize upon this as a justification for their com se of Action. What is stated in the above hypothetical ease has actually occurred, and some of the brethren have been greatly disturbed by reason of it, and have written letters to the Watch Tower to know w hat to do. With such a subtle trick of the adversary b&lt; mg put forward </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> must sound the alarm, giving warning to God’s people that they be not influenced by such fallacious speech. If it were merely to answer an argument </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> would pars it unnoticed; but this is an effort of Satan to steal God's people and hinder his work, and the faithful will not shun to sound the warning. (Ps. 50:18) The Word of God is the guide for his people. (Ps. 119: 105) No man is the teacher of the Lord’s anointed, and they need no man to teach them, because Christ Jesus is at the temple. (1 John 2:27) If </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">publishes anything that is not supported by the Scriptures, do not give heed thereto. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> endeavors at all times to &quot;prove all things” by the Word of God. The faithful anointed ones w’dl know ■whether the points published are supported by the Word of God or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Joshua knew that the number of the enemy armies far outnumbered his own army; but he was there at Gilgal as the servant of Jehovah God and riady and willing to carry out the orders from the Lord, and he gave heed to the Lord’s commandments: “And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.”—Josh. 10: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Likewise those in Christ Jesus, who are at the temple and hence a part of the Greater Joshua, fully appreciate the fact that the enemy far outnumbers the remnant; but the business of the remnant is to obey orders from the Lord, and therefore the Lord says to the remnant, who now go out to face the confederated enemy: “Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.”—Matt. 10: 26, 28, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah has commissioned his witnesses and sent them forth to bear the fruits of the kingdom before the people. The witnesses go as commanded because they love God, and for this reason they do not fear the enemy. They give heed to the Scriptural instructions from the Lord, to wit: “Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment ; because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because lear hath torment. He that fearcth, is not made perfect in love.” (1 John 4:17,18) No man or company of men can now stand successfully against the Lord and present the work of the Lord’s people from being done. The anointed remnant being perfect in love toward God are wholly devoted to him, and, l\y his grace, they will do what thej<sup>r</sup> are commanded by the Lord to do, regardless of the efforts of man or devils.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> With full confidence in the Lord Joshua lost no time in getting his army on the march Likewise God’s people must now lose no time in marching out with the banner of the Lord lifted high, and they must mark out the way for the people of good will to go. (Isa. 62:10) Joshua did not he down and sleep during the night and wait for a ‘more favorable’ time next day to move, but he went immediately: “Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.”—Josh. 10:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Throughout the night he pushed his army rapidly, and arrived before he was expected. On a previous occasion it seems to have taken three days to cover the same ground, in moving the army, that Joshua covered that night. (Josh. 9:16,17) Joshua, seeing the importance of quick action, made a forced march over a rocky country, and up a decided ascent or climb. Probably his men were faint, worn and weary, but they kept right on and reached Gibeon early, to the surprise of the enemy. There was no slacking of the hand on the part of the Israelites there. Likewise it must be with the remnant of this day, that they see that it is the Lord’s time to carry the message forward. They go, and do not stop to listen to the platitudes and high-sounding speech of some self-important man who thinks that he has some “understanding”, but in fact has none. Now Jehovah keeps the remnant informed in advance, that they may not be surprised and overreached by the enemy, and he leads them by the hand of the Greater Joshua so that the enemy cannot catch the remnant off guard. Those who read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font4"> with a critical and faultfinding spirit, who murmur and complain at what the Lord gives his people, can have no understanding of God’s purpose. (Dan. 12:10) It is just such that the enemy uses to deceive the witnesses of Jehovah; but those faithful witnesses will feed upon the Lord’s Word and be guided by it and, when they see the explanation of a prophecy, know whether the same is according to the Word of God or not, and then they have no trouble to stay in line of march against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> It appears that the confederated enemy that had laid siege to Gibeon was about to begin the final assault upon the city, when Joshua arrived with his army. That was a critical hour for the Gibeonites, likely their last stand; otherwise they would not have sent such an urgent appeal to Joshua. Having voluntarily placed themselves under Joshua and become servants of him and the other Israelites, the Gibeonites must have been trusting in God and in his representative. They looked and hoped for deliverance from the enemy at the hands of Joshua because they were firmly abiding by and performing their part of thecovenant which they had made a few days previous with Joshua and his people. The Gibeonites knew that if they surrendered to the confederated enemy they would hem fit nothing but would then be subjected to destruction at the hand of Joshua, because they believed that the God of Joshua had commissioned him to subdue Canaan and that he would do so. Their desertion from the Israelites now would mean certain destruction of the Gibeonites to which they had been doomed before making their covenant with Joshua. (Josh. 9:24) This part of the picture exactly fits the present condition of the people of good will toward God, who have taken the first step towards reuniting themselves with God’s organization. They are no longer desired by the nations of this world, but are hated by the worldlings because those confederated powers stand for Satan and are against all who are for God and his kingdom. Those who have turned to the Lord are marked for death by Satan and his crowd. They have looked to God and Christ, and now they know that their salvation comes only from God and by and through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1T</sup> What took place between Joshua and the other Israelites and the people of Gibeon up to this point was previous to the fight or battle at Gibeon. Seeing that the people of the community of the Gibeonites pictured the great multitude, while the Israelites uu-der Joshua pictured Jehovah’s chosen people who are now under the command of Christ Jesus, the events that came to pass up to this </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">point </span><span class="font4">picture what is to be done by Jehovah’s witnesses before the battle of Armageddon is fought. It has pleased Jehovah to cause to be written in his propheej’ various pictures foretelling the events that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lead </span><span class="font4">up to Armageddon and of what Armageddon consists. All of these pictures show that the work to be done by Jehovah’s witnesses precedes the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that the remnant bear witness to the great multitude after the battle of Armageddon, of which the battle of Gibeon was a type. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has frequently stressed the point, and here again repeats it, that the great objective in the outworking of God’s purpose is the vindication of his name and to that end he first causes a witness to be given to those who will hear concerning his name and his mighty organization under Christ Jesus, and thereafter he demonstrates his great power by destroying Satan and all those who align themselves with Satan. There is nothing in the Scriptures to show that God has any purpose of exalting some creature and making that creature’s name great. There is nothing in the Scriptures to show that God now, in this day preceding Armageddon, selects some man and assigns to that man “a great work that he must do”. There is no reason why the Lord should do such a thing, because the exaltation of men is an abomination in his sight. When a man in this day says in the hearing of others, ‘‘I have a special work to perform, but my hands arc completely tied,” there is much ground to doubt the sanity of that person. At least it shows that he does </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">have an understanding of the Scriptures. The Scriptures do not show that God has singled out any man and given him ‘‘a special work to do” in this day, and then causes that man’s hands to be completely tied </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font4">that he cannot do his assigned work. In fact, the prophecy of Obadiah emphasizes this truth, that, aside from the Lord Jesus Christ, not one of the faithful servant class is identified. There is absolutely nothing in the Scriptures to show that God used a man </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">foreshadow or picture another man and his work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">fact, no man is used in the Scriptures to foreshadow the man Jesus. Joshua foreshadowed Christ Jesus. The very thing that brought so much sorrow amopgst men was the covetous desire of Satan to be exalted. If any man makes it known that he is specially chosen of the Lord to do some specific work, we may know that such man is either weak in the mind or else being moved by the spirit of Satan. The great issue to be determined is, Who is supreme? The name of Jehovah must be and will be vindicated. Men are of no importance so far as they are individually concerned. The remnant will keep this point clearly in mind, and will therefore always know that it is worse than foolish to listen to the claims of a man who is looking for honor and exaltation among men. The remnant will be guided by Jehovah God through his Word, and by his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus, and, being so guided, will now give heed to and joyfully obey the commandments of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FINAL BATTLE FORESHADOWED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah emphasizes the truth time and again that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font4">will fight the final battle against the enemy, and which battle shall completely annihilate the enemy and vindicate God’s name. Joshua, as a type of Christ Jesus, led the Israelites to Gibeon; and while the Israelites were there for war, the proof is overwhelming that it was Jehovah who fought the battle to a decisive end, Joshua being the visible leader: “And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.” (Josh. 10:10, A.A.V.) The Israelites were there and saw the battle, but it was the Lord Jehovah God who did the fighting so effectually. It was not the mere sudden arrival of Joshua and his little army that so frightened the confederated enemy and caused them to flee, but it was Jehovah who caused the enemy to get started on the rout. Was that an expression of Jehovah’s anger against the enemy? Was Jehovah wroth when he slew the besiegers of Gibeon? lie so states by his prophet, and says that he will again rise up against the enemy and express his anger; that ‘‘he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon”. (Isa. 28: 21) The point here is that when Jehovah begins to take action against the enemy he will do so in anger, as ho did when he began the assault upon the confederated enemy that was attacking and besieging Gibeon. At the first battle, of Gibeon Joshua was the visible leader. At the second battle of Gibeon King David was the visible leader against the enemy. Both Joshua and David pictured the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Leader, the Field Marshal and Executioner of Jehovah in the final battle against the enemy, ‘‘the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” Joshua was invincible because he was Jehovah’s servant and strictly obeyed God’s law and commandment; and in this he pictured Christ Jesus, who knows no defeat and who will win a signal victory at Armageddon.—Josh. 1: 5-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> That the first battle of Gibeon was Jehovah’s war or fight against the enemy is made certain by the Scriptures. Joshua made a forced march and brought the chosen people of God to the place of battle, and then ‘Jehovah discomfited the enemy, and Jehovah slew the enemy with great slaughter’. (A.R.V.) Thus began the great battle at Gibeon, and the great slaughter that resulted caused the confederated enemy to flee. Jehovah (by Joshua his representative) chased the enemy to Beth-horon (meaning ‘‘house of hollowness”, such as caves). The fight began at the city of Gibeon, but did not end there. The beginning of the fight broke the confederated stronghold, because those confederated forces broke up and fled from before the Lord. There is now a confederacy between the religionist, commercial and political crowd to destroy Jehovah’s earthly organization. The beginning of the battle at the city of Gibcon may well picture the beginning of the battle of Armageddon, and which will destroy the religionists’ combine and break up the confederacy; but that is not the conclusion of the battle, for the reason that the conclusion shows the destruction of the entire wicked organization of Satan.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> At page 287 of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> this statement appears: This “seems ... to indicate two distinctive parts of Armageddon: (1) That which accomplishes the destruction of hypocritical religionists; and (2) that which accomplishes the complete destruction of all of Satan’s organization”. This statement is not intended to be dogmatic, of course, because it is only a conclusion drawn from the picture. It does seem certain, however, that there is no period of time between the beginning, or first part, of Armageddon and the final part, in which there is a witness work done for the great multitude. Jehovah plainly declares that when he ‘brings to pass his act, his strange act’, it will be done in wrath as at Gibcon. (Isa. 28:21) The religionists constitute a powerful part of the confederacy or alliance that now exists, and when that part of it is destroyed it will seem very strange to others of Satan’s organization. The Scriptures make it clearly to appear that after the destruction of the old “whore”,then the “beast” and the “false prophet” are taken and destroyed and then the Devil goes down in complete defeat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah was chasing the enemy and they' were fleeing, and while on the dead run the Lord Jehovah slew them. “And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon [lower Beth-horon], that the Lord cast dowm great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. ’ ’—J osh. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Those who survived that part of the battle which took place at the city of Gibeon seemed to be at the time outstripping the pursuers and apparently making a getaway from the sword, and then Jehovah opened his batteries in heaven against them and slew more than had been slain by the sw’ord. In speaking of the expression of Jehovah’s wrath against the enemy his prophet says: “Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one [the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus]; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, will he cast down to the earth with the hand.” (Isa. 28: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.</span><span class="font4">I<sup>7</sup>.) This mighty and strong One mentioned uses his power as a “tempest of hail”, which sweeps away the refuge of lies and destroys the liars, and then “a destroying storm”, which does the complete slaying. In that same prophecy it is written: “And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (Vs. 17) A “tempest of hail” is one thing, and “a destroying storm” another and far greater thing. The latter may be or may not be accompanied with hail. A great storm in w'hich many hailstones fall would be a “destroying storm”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> To be sure, hail is used in the Scriptures symbolically to picture some other or more forceful power. It is written, “Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?” (Job 38: 22,23) “And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” (Rev. 16:21) In these texts “hail” is clearly symbolic of cold and hard truths, which are destructive to lies. Hail is a “sign” and a “wonder”, that glorifies Jehovah and exhibits his power. (Ps. 148:7,8; Ex. 9:18-33) It is Jehovah God who sends forth his truth, revealing and causing to be proclaimed the meaning of his prophecies, and this he does in the day of Jehovah. The cold, hard truths expose to view the lies that have long deceived the people, and bring the liars into disrepute and disgrace. Jehovah sends forth his anointed witnesses to proclaim his truth, and by his truth he sweeps away the lies; but where there is a great storm, during which hail of large size falls, the hail and wind together constitute a “destroying storm”, and it is the destroying storm of Jehoxah that does the dc-sti active work. These words of description give us some idea of the manner in which Jehovah expresses his wrath against the enemy. The important point for consideration, howexer, is that it is Jehovah who expresses his anger and that expressed anger results in discomfiting and destroying his enemies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> The first battle of Gibeon, when the forces were led by Joshua, was one battle, but it was not all fought at the city. The most destructive part of that battle was after the confederated enemy forces had fled and were going down to the rocky country where the caves were situated, and it was then, while on the way, that the “destroying storm” of Jehovah overtook the enemy. It was then that Jehovah cast dowm from heaven great stones, presumably chunks of ice formed by many pieces of hail uniting as they fell and making larger pieces of ice, which would easily kill a man when striking him. As an illustration of the effect of hail the following is quoted from the public press:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“An unusual fall of gigantic hailstones is reported from Johannesburg, South Africa. They fell in northern Transvaal on February 1, and killed nineteen natives and many animals. A cloudburst in which three inches of rain fell in a few minutes was followed by the hailstones, many as big as grapefruit. They covered the ground in the area affected to a depth of thice feet, and many of the natives who were killed had to be dug out of the ice. The unusual feature about the hailstones was that they were described as jagged pieces of ice instead of the smoothly rounded pieces. The largest hailstone of record is one seventeen inches in circumference and weighing one and a half pounds. It fell in Nebraska in July, 1928.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> It will be properly said that there were two parts of the battle of Gibeon, because the first part was fought near the city, while the other part was fought in the valley. But there was no period of waiting between the two parts. It was really one fight. It all took place in one day. This may suggest to some that &quot;the battle of that great day of God Almighty” may be in two parts: the first, destroying the religionists; and that which follows, bringing even a greater destruction upon all parts of Satan’s organization. This is not so material, however, but is merely stated as a suggestion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> In the prophecy by Isaiah (28:17) the statement is that the Lord lays judgment to the line and righteousness to the plummet, that is to say, that the judgment is so strict and straight and right that it is wholly righteous, and nothing escapes that judgment. That judgment is by the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Judge at the temple, when the nations are gathered before him and he does the separating work; and in this connection the prophecy further says: “And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” This docs not seem to be Armageddon, but rather pertains to the fight that is now in progress. The Lord Jesus is separating the nations and at the same time sending forth his “faithful and wise servant” class with the cold, hard truths, symbolized by hail, which, being forcefully delivered, and that regardless of all opposition, uncovers the lies of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, and exposes them to full view. The Lord then seems to fix the time and order of Armageddon by the words of his prophet, who says: “When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.” According to another rendering of the text it reads: “When the overflowing scourge sweepeth past, then shall ye be thereby beaten down.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> This part of the prophecy emphasizes the time when the destruction shall take place. The Lord is now lashing the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy with the message or “hail” of truth, and it stings them terribly and causes their crookedness to be exposed to view. Such, however, is not Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” It is Jehovah’s “work” that precedes the battle of Armageddon. It is during this period of witnessing by telling the message of truth that the great multitude is gathered unto the Lord, and this is done before the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” begins, that is, before the “destroying storm” breaks upon the enemy. The war that is now on between the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and God’s anointed witnesses is pictured in Revelation 12:17 as the ‘old dragon’s attacking or making war against the remnant’; and in this warfare the remnant uses the Word of God as a weapon or scourge of war, and which exposes to view the lies of the enemy, and the enemy is brought into disgrace. Through this and many other scriptures it appears that, when the witness work is done, which witnessing the Lord uses to expose the lies of the enemy as w<sup>r</sup>ell as to inform the people of good will, “when the overflowing scourge sweepeth past,” then Jehovah will express his indignation by and through Christ Jesus, who is his “mighty and strong one”, and that in this expression of his wrath his “destroying storm” annihilates the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Note here the text by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> concerning the 'scourge sweeping past’. “As often as it sweepeth past, it shall take you away, for morning by mornine shall it pass along, by day and by night, and it shall be nothing less than a terror to make out the message.” (Isa. 28:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> While the fight is on now and Jehovah’s witnesses arc moving daily into action, proclaiming the praise of Jehovah and his kingdom, and the day of the vengeance of our God against the wicked, the hail is thus sweeping away the lies, and that “message” is nothing less than a terror to the enemy when they hear it. This is proved by the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies arc now doing everything within their power to prevent the message from going forth. They cry out: “What these people say shocks our religious susceptibilities, and we don’t want to hear it by radio, sound car or any other means.” It is while this fight is on that the people of good will are informed, and thus the Lord is gathering them into his organization, that is, he is gathering in his “other sheep”, which constitute the great multitude. This present warfare between the faithful servant class and the enemy is not Armageddon, but is merely a skirmish immediately preceding Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Traveling with his little army all night, Joshua arrived at Gibeon early in the morning, and the battle began immediately, and while the moon was still shining in the west. The confederated Amorites fled, and it was as they wore fleeing that Jehovah smote them with great stones of ice from heaven: “Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and be said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.”— Josh. 10:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The enemy was fleeing to the west in complete rout. The moon was still shining in the west, and the storm was coming up from the west, and the clouds had not yet obscured the moon, which evidently was shining above the storm clouds. Joshua, seeing the situation, uttered a prayer before his men that the light might not be obscured but that the forces of the Lord might continue to fight until the complete destruction of the enemy had been accomplished so that there need be no repetition of the battle with the Amorites. This is in line with what Jesus says concerning Armageddon, that it shall be a finish fight and a complete wiping out of the enemy, that it shall be ‘tribulation such as never was, no, nor ever shall be*. (Matt. 24:21) When the Amorite combined forces got into the valley, they were being pursued from the rear by the army of Joshua, and a great and destructive storm met them on their front, and so there was no way for them to escape. This is like the description given by Jeremiah concerning the enemy at Armageddon: “And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.’’ (Jer. 25:35) Again this supports the conclusion that the shepherds (clergy) go down first, and then follow the principal ones of the flock, and other portions of Satan’s organization. While this is not two battles, it does not seem improper to say that there are two parts of one battle: destroying (1) the religionists, and then (2) the rest of the Devil’s bunch.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> From what follows it is certain that the prayer of Joshua was in accord with the will of God when he prayed for the moon and the sun to stand still. “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashcr? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.’’—Josh. 10:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> If the enemy had been praying and hoping that they might do all their wicked deeds and then escape in the darkness, they were sorely disappointed. The effect on the eyes of all those on the earth was that the moon stayed and the sun stood still. Just how this was accomplished, an opinion might be advanced here, but that docs not seem necessary. Nothing is impossible with Jehovah God, and manifestly this part of the prophetic picture foreshadowed that the light of God and Christ shall continue to shine while the destruction of the enemy takes place. Other prophecies show that when Armageddon is being fought the enemy will be in complete darkness, such as would accompany a destroying storm, while the people of God will have light. “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, at the light of thine arrows as they went, at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (Hab. 3:11, A.Zf.F.) “Sun, moon, have stood still on high, like light thine arrows speed along, like brightness is the flash of thy spear.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> It was Joshua who prayed that the light might’ continue while the battle was being fought, and God gave him and his forces light; and this, being the prophetic picture, undoubtedly corroborates what Habakkuk says, that, while darkness envelopes the enemy, God will give light to his own people. Furthermore, this shows that Armageddon will not be interrupted by things determining time, such as sun or moon, but that the battle will be fought through to a finish and to the utter destruction of Jehovah’s enemies. None of the forces of the Lord or of his people who sing his praises complain at the length of time consumed in the battle. They have light and they rejoice. Gideon (who also pictured Christ Jesus) with his little band of warriors marched all night, “faint, yet pursuing” (Judg. 8:4); but they were not complaining against the Lord because of their hardships or the length of the battle. Likewise Jehovah’s faithful witnesses will not complain of the length of time, either before or during the progress of the battle of Armageddon. That Jehovah can and docs perform miracles according to his will, such as making the sun stand still, is certain: “Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.” (Isa. 38:8) These prophetic scriptures all support one conclusion: that when the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins, it will be fought through to a complete finish, and that there will not be two battles or “two phases of Armageddon”, but only one, and that the witness work to the great multitude must be completed before that time begins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> This conclusion is also definitely sustained by the words of Christ Jesus, who commanded his followers to bear the fruits of the kingdom before the nations of the world, and to finish it before the great trouble. “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24:14,21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The preaching of this gospel of the kingdom, which is now being done by the witnesses of the Lord, must be done to the nations as a witness; and for what purpose? There could be but one purpose, and that the vindication of Jehovah’s name; which is the great question for determination. This, then, is the day about which God caused Moses to write, stating the reason why he permitted the Devil to carry on his wicked work during a specific time, to wit, “That my name may be declared throughout all the earth [to all nations].” (Ex. 9:16) This God does now in declaring his name throughout the earth that the enemy may be notified of his purpose, and that the people of good will may be warned, know that Jehovah is the God of salvation, and the onlj” means of salvation, and that they must flee to him and his kingdom, and do this before the “winter” time, that is, before the great battle sets in. There is no reason why the great multitude should hear the kingdom message for the first time after Armageddon is fought. There is no scripture sustaining the conclusion that the great multitude will be gathered after Armageddon. All the Scriptural texts bearing upon the matter show that the witnessing must be completed that the people of good will, who are desirous of escaping from Satan’s organization, may do so and gather themselves unto God and his organization and declare themselves on his side. Then they must faithfully’- and continually seek righteousness and meekness until the battle of the great day breaks upon the enemy, and this they must do if they would find protection during that great tribulation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Describing the first battle at Gibeon the prophet further says: “Is not this written in the book of Jasher </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font4"> the Upright]?’’ The word “Jasher’’, or “Jashar” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(It.V.),</span><span class="font4"> is related to “Jeshurun”, being derived from the same root. “Jeshurun” is first mentioned by Moses in the prophecy at Deuteronomy in connection with the covenant of faithfulness. (Deut. 32:15; 33: 5, 26) Jehovah is the “Upright One”, and the miracle concerning the sun and the moon that he performed during the battle at Gibeon is written in his book. The miracle, therefore, must be true, regardless of the fact that worldly-wise men scoff at the possibility of such a thing’s being accomplished. “Jeshurun” is the name by which Jehovah’s covenant people arc designated and signified as a “righteous people”. It means the nation of Jehovah, the “holy nation”, God’s people, who are in the covenant with him for the kingdom, and which people stand for Jehovah in the righteousness of Christ. Jesus their head. The recording of the aforementioned miracle concerning the sun and the moon was undoubtedly for the aid, comfort and hope of the faithful remnant now on the earth. It is to be expected that the “Upright One”, Jehovah, would give to his people in this day of judgment a revelation and understanding of why the record was made concerning Joshua ami his army at Gibeon. It is insulting to the Lord for anyone to say that these things are mere expressions of man’s opinion. What could any man hope to gain by making such expressions of opinion? Those who believe that these things are expressions of opinion of a man, as stated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> should give no heed to them, and they will not do so. Those who now understand and believe that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the Teachers of the people of Jeshurun will rejoice to see how marvelously Jehovah has provided for his people in this day and will give all honor and praise to Jehovah and his anointed King. The faithful ones will hear and give heed to the words of Jehovah addressed to Zion, and which apply specifically now: “Let not thine hands be slack.” (Zeph. 3:1G) With the zeal of Christ Jesus they will continue to press onward, singing as they go: “Bless the Lord, 0 my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits.”—Ps. 103:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH appoints his Avenger of all the blood that has been spilled and all the human lives that have been crushed out by the Devil’s organization. The Avenger is now on the trail of that gory, blood-besmeared organization with its shameful record of millions of willful murders of the poor innocents. In that organization there are many who are prisoners, out of sympathy with it, and who have therefore been unwilling and unwitting parties to the crimes of that organization. Toescape the destructive sword of ChrKt Jesus, Jehovah’s great Avenger of blood, at Armageddon, such unfortunate ones must get out before Armageddon. Otherwise the sword will overtake them. They need the truth to make them free. The highway must be prepared to the great city of refuge, Jehovah’s organization. That highway and city of refuge must be pointed out to such unwitting manslayers, that they may speedily betake themselves over the highway and escape to the refuge provided under Jehovah’s great High Priest, Christ Jesus, and thereby be shielded in the day of vengeance. Concerning such the law in Jehovah’s kingdom covenant reads: “Thou shalt separate . . . cities [of refuge] in the midst of thy land, . . . Thou shalt prepare thee a way, . . . that every slayer may flee thither.” (Deut. 19: 2, 3; Numbers 35; Joshua 20) Those in the kingdom covenant have been “called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name ’ ’, and it is to these that Jehovah has given command: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” (Isa. 62:2, 10) Satan, in harmony with his destructive purposes, tries to turn the people away from Jehovah God and hence to turn them aside from this highway; and he would like, if possible, to turn the attention of Jehovah’s witnesses away from those who need now to escape over the highway from the judgment sword of the Avenger and Vindicator of Jehovah’s name. The faithful will not permit their attention to be diverted from those to whom attention must now be given according to God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses will not be thrown off guard by any suggestions or arguments of the great enemy. They know it is imperative that the work in behalf of the Jonadab or sheep class be done now. The King’s words ring loudly in their ears: “Then shall the end come. When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso rcadetb, let him understand:) then let them which be in Juda:a flee into the mountains: . . . pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” (Matt. 21; 14-20) Jehovah’s witnesses have read, and by his loving-kindness have come to spiritual understanding, and hence they do see or discern that abomination of desolation standing like a usurper in the holy place of Jehovah's kingdom. The prophet Daniel (11:31; 12: 11) foretold that the Devil ’s forces would violently take away “the daily sacrifcc” and would place or set up this abomination that maketh desolate. That “daily sacrifice” is not the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ; it could not be such, for he has appeared in the presence of Jehovah God with the full value of his human sacrifice, and it is therefore beyond removal by Satan’s servants. But the “daily sacrifice” was and is the continual or daily offering up by Jehovah’s faithful servant class on earth of praise and thanksgiving to him by publicly proclaiming the message of truth he has given his people. Such procedure is an offering up of “spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ”. (1 Pet. 2: 5) In this the members of Jehovah’s “royal priesthood” under Christ Jesus must be continually or daily engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy took this “daily sacrifice” away in 1918. They framed mischief by man-made laws and used their strong-arm squad to forcibly restrain God’s people who were performing this sacrifice by publishing the Kingdom message. To this presumptuous act against Jehovah God the enemy added further insolence by rejecting his anointed King and his kingdom and then setting up a deceptive substitute, to serve as a “political expression of the kingdom of God on earth” and operated by their own crowd in control. This was abominable to God. It was of desolating power to those who looked for and hoped in God’s kingdom. The taking away of the daily sacrifice meant the enemy’s stopping of the kingdom proclamation; conversely, the setting up of the desolating abomination would mean the enemy’s hateful activity in leaguing or conspiring together for offering up a sacrifice to the Devil in place of the one to Jehovah, and which finds its most prominent expression in proclaiming and maintaining the League of Nations as a substitute in place of God’s holy kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus commanded that when Jehovah’s witnesses should see this, then they should sound the warning to others, that those of good will who desired to praise Jehovah God might get out of Satan’s doomed organization and flee to God’s kingdom, pictured as mountains of safe refuge. The Lord Jesus did not say that such people should wait until Armageddon has actually begun and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the other clergy of “Christendom” have been exposed by Jehovah’s “strange work” and overthrown by his “strange act”. (Isa. 28:21) The substance of Jesus’ warning is, Upon seeing the prophecy fulfilled, flee, without delay and without turning back, thankful that you may flee before the winter (or hard time) and before the sabbath day (when the witness work preceding the battle is done). Flight in the “winter” or on the “sabbath day” is something for one to pray to avoid. To delay for first some “strange” manifestation by Jehovah God might mean your attempting to flee at a difficult time, when it is impossible to get through to the mountains. To pray that your flight be not then means to flee </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">noiv,</span><span class="font4"> ere winter and sabbath set in. Such is the urgent need for prompt flight now by the “great multitude” of Jonadabs. Hence it calls also for the continuous and unslackening activity by Jehovah’s witnesses, and that now, to point out to the Jonadabs the way of escape to the mountains of Jehovah’s kingdom by his Christ. This responsibility Jehovah’s witnesses cannot shirk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To these witnesses and to those others who would be on Jehovah’s side as Jonadabs or Christ’s “other sheep” Jehovah by his prophet says: “Before [not, When it begins; but, Before] the decree bring forth, . . . before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon j<sup>T</sup>ou. Seek ye [Jehovah], all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of [Jehovah’s] anger.” And why? Because, adds the prophet, Jehovah’s judgments are to be executed upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">modern Philistines, destroying their organization, “that there shall be no inhabitant.” (Zeph. 2: 2-6) Further describing that day of the Lord’s anger, the prophet says: “The day that I [Jehovah] rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. ’ ’ Then the prophet foretells how on the day of Jehovah and before his anger breaks forth at Armageddon Jehovah delivers his faithful remnant from the power of the Devil’s organization Babylon and sets them to work in God's organization Zion as his witnesses. Concerning that time of activity by his servants Jehovah then says: “In that day it shall be said [by Jehovah through Christ Jesus] to Jerusalem, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fear </span><span class="font4">thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. The Lord [Jehovah] thy God in the midst of thee is mighty.” (Zeph. 3: 8, 16, 17) For no cause whatsoever are Jehovah’s children by his “woman” Zion to slack hand in his service. Neither through indifference, laziness, false arguments, nor through fear </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">enemy. Arranging for the enemy’s destruction, Jehovah maneuvers their hosts so as to “gather the nations” and to “assemble the kingdoms” of the enemy organization. They are gathered and assembled against the earthly members of Jehovah’s organization Zion, his witnesses, and those others who have taken </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">stand on Jehovah’s side. (Zech. 14: 1-3) But Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, should not fear and let their hands slack because of paralyzing fear. They know from God's own word that the kingdoms and nations arc gathered to (as the nations think) destroy Jehovah’s people; but it means the destruction of all the nations combined by one stroke of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By now Jehovah's witnesses should be well convinced from the Lord’s Word that their work must continue on in the face of steadily increasing opposition from Satan’s quarter. This opposition causes Jehovah’s fury to rise up in his face and he smites them low </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">Armageddon. In spite of the continuing opposition Jehovah blesses “his land”, the earthly condition of his people, with prosperity in his service. Satan’s spirit field marshal, Gog, is vexed at this prosperity. He begrudges Jehovah every one who in response to the Kingdom witness promptly forsakes the side of his [Gog’s] lord, Satan, and lines up on the side of Jehovah’s witnesses in Zion and worships Jehovah in his temple there. The remnant’s prosperity in spiritual values is not as a result of slackness or idleness; for the sluggard comes to poverty. (Prov. 24: 33, 34) Jehovah blesses them with prosperity because of faithfulness and zealous service as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence Gog and his hordes oppose, and finally they invade the “land” (the earthly rights and privileges) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Jehovah’s people to spoil them and reduce them to poverty and captivity, as was done in 1918. “And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face.” (Ezek. 38: 1-18) “Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle” in ancient times. (Zeeh. 14: 3) Vindicative victory will be with Jehovah and all on his side. In view of this the present increase of opposition by Gog and all his hosts in heaven and earth should neither surprise nor dishearten Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. Rather this should be encouraging as surely indicating that the battle of Armageddon is near, and its glorious outcome. For this reason they should hasten on with their God-given work, appreciating their privileges while still theirs to be performed, and fearing lest such he removed from them through laxity and coming short and be given to the ones constant in zeal and faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let none be disquieted because their indhidual efforts seem to be somewhat unproductive and the Lord is not yet bringing in the “other sheep’’ (the Jonadabs) in the overwhelming numbers that some think their efforts up till now justify them in expecting. Jehovah’s own word-picture at Revelation 7: 9-15 shows his will and his objective to be that the outer courts of his temple shall be thronged with joyful devoted human creatures, a “great multitude” of them, of unknown number. Bringing these to his temple is His business by Christ Jesus. lie is now getting whither he wants with it. lie fails not, let the enemy increase their opposition all they will. The rate at which lie brings in those of the “great multitude” is his concern. The facts show he is bringing Ihem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord asks those of his temple class on earth: “Who hath despised the day of small thiims?” The “small things” for the time being test the faith, but those full of faith will not despise such things ami leap to wrong conclusions, but will draw reassurance from the w’ords, “Not by rnieht, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Zeeh. 4: JO, 6) That does not mean that they must not work, working hard and with diligence. It means that the Lord gives the increase and the success. Hence he says to his servants: “Yet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font4"> be strong, . . . and work.” (Hag. 2: 4) There is still more work to be done, and much of it; but that should not be construed to mean that the event for which we all long, the final battle, is far distant and we may go easy meantime and take our time. If more work and much of it remains, then the efforts of all should be intensified Io get it done in the time allotted before the battle, that at that time ■we may, like the ‘man in linen’, report the matter, saying, “I have done as thou hast commanded me.” —Ezek. 9: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opportunity and the call is for service in God’s temple “day and night”, or all the time. It is prophetically written of the “great multitude” of nonpriestly people of good will that, having cleaned up and identified themselves on Jehovah’s side, “therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple.” (Rev. 7: 15) They must thus maintain their integrity toward God. If, then, it be so with the people in the courts, certainly also the priestly class, Jehovah’s witnesses, are required to be on the job “day and night” in his temple to minister unto these that serve Jehovah “day and night”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s throne is established, with Christ Jesus at his right hand. Out from the throne of the Kingdom proceeds the “pure river of water of life”, the Kingdom truth. The Great Spirit, Jehovah, by his Bridegroom Son, Christ Jesus, says, Come; and the bride class, at one with him in the temple, joins him in saying, Come. “And let him that heareth say, Come. And . . . take the water of life freely. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, ... If any man shad take away from the words of the book of this prophecy [including that concerning the great multitude], God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.” (Rev. 22: 17-19) The faithful remnant on earth of Christ’s bride will not take away nor deny the work now fulfilling the prophecy concerning the “great multitude”, but will continue therein until it is successfully finished in vindication of Jehovah’s own Word. Thus they maintain their part in the Lamb’s book of life in heaven and maintain their part in the holy city, the capital organization, “the New Jerusalem,” and they will come into and abundantly enjoy all the blessings written in Jehovah’s book, that he may be glorified.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LETTERS FROM AFIELD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH TRUE TO HIS PROMISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a recent meeting of this company it was unanimously and enthusiastically resolved that a letter be sent to you conveying the love of all the brethren in this part of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True to his piomiso, the great Jehovah has indeed opened the windows of heaven and is pouring out such a shower of blessings upon his people thioughout the earth in these days that there is not loom enough to receive it. Among these many blessings, the iccounting of which would take too much time and space, was that inspiring lecture of Februaiy 23, ‘'Separating the Nations,” which we in Adelaide weio privileged to hear almost in its entirety. As we listened to the bold, fearless words which exposed so cleaily the cruel and devilish Hierarchy, we realized, as never belore, that this is the Lord’s doing and marvelous in our eyes. It is not reasonable to conclude that the Devil’s crowd would have pe'initted such an exposure to be made had they been able to pievent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although we were not able, at the tune, to listen to your talk on ‘‘Feasts” and to join in the declaration made at the conclusion thereof, wo have since been enabled to appropriate to ouisehcs the meat in duo season found in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tou.tr</span><span class="font3"> dealing with that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the service meeting held May 30, the Adelaide company of Jehovah’s witnesses, along with their associates, the ‘‘great multitude” in this place, enthusiastically adopted this declaration by a rising vote, and will endeavor, by the Lord's grace, to prove our words by a consistent and persistent course of action in the King’s business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We realize that we have been greatly blessed in this place in that we have had freedom from persecution; and we also appreciate that, to whom much has been given, much also will be required. From now on, the sound-equipment work will be pushed more than ever before, because it is cleaily evident that this phase of the work is essential in the gathering together of the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be assured, Brother Rutherford, of our hearty and willing co-operation </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">hi</span><span class="font3"> the abundant and glorious work the Lord has given us to do. We thank you ami the other brethren at headquarters for all that you have done and are still doing for us in this section of the field. Wc love you and pray our heavenly Father that you may bo given the necessary strength and grace to carry on the woik until it is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH FURNISHES THE MEANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We, the pioneers working in the Columbus (Ohio) area, being assembled together, desiie to express our thanks and appreciation for the following blessings which Jehovah has extended to us: for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> and the daily strength it gives to sustain God’s faithful; for the sacrifices which the Bethel family has made on behalf of the pioneers; and for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Euhrs </span><span class="font3">book, which brings the joyful piospeet of having a part in a uii'.dity campaign to vindicate Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The feast of spiritual food spread for Jehovah’s people at the leeent conventions was surelv encouraging and mspiung, and gave greater determination to prove our integrity to the end. The light God is furnishing his people thiough </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The ll’atchtoicr.r</span><span class="font3"> is suicly growing brighter and brighter, illuminating the path of the just. For these blessings we are continually thankful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The electric, sign was a pleasant surprise. At the proper time Jehovah furnishes the means by which his people reveal their identity as his witnesses, and affords gieater opportunity to sing forth his piaises. Ceitain it is that God has caused his people to be ‘ ‘ sei vice minded ” to meet the privileges and responsibilities of the great and glorious work now facing us. Our piaycrs aie for those who throughout the earth now suffer for God’s truth and for the sake of his name, that they may bo sustained by hope, strength and eneouiagemcnt, and lor the guidance and blessing of all in responsible positions m God's organization on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By Jehovah’s glace it is my determination to stay with you as you aie used by him to direct the activities of his people here, and with his witnesses as they push the battle against Satan’s wicked organization on eaith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I just want you to know of my continued appreciation and joy in the increasing light of Truth, and assure you of my love as 1 see your unswerving love for and devotion to Jehovah the King Eternal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With fondest love we greet </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font3">in the name of God’s dear Son, Christ Jesus our Lord. We the Port Limon division of Jehovah’s organization take this opportunity of sending you a few lines, despite the fact that we dislike to encroach on your valuable and limited time so </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">much </span><span class="font3">used up in the sei vice of Jehovah and Gideon, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">yet </span><span class="font3">we </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">constrained to drop you </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">few lines to express in a very </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">feeble </span><span class="font3">way our thankfulness to the great Jehovah (whose Word is in our heart as a burning fire shut up in our bones, so </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">cannot forbear writing you [Jer. 20: 9]), and his illustrious Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, for supplying his people with that all-amazing and wonderful treasure, the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font3"> What a book! Indeed the Lord has accomplished his promise toward those who love him, in that he has ‘opened the windows of heaven, and poured us out a blessing, that there is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font3">room enough to receive it’. —Mal. 3: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We stand in wonderment as </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">behold the stately steppings of Jehovah of hosts, and the unfolding of his purposes toward his little ones while surrounded by the enemy, who would immediately destroy us because (by His grace) we keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Fiom the depths of our hearts </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">exclaim, ‘There is none like the God of Jeshurun, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.' We fail to express ourselves adequately in words of thankfulness to the great Creator for this his latest gift of hard </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hail</span><span class="font3"> to place in the hands </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">those of good will, thus from “the housetop” exposing </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s </span><span class="font3">organization, and in a special way the chief visible part of it, the Roman Catholic liter archy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wo fully realize and appreciate the fact that the “old woman” Jezebel is having her susceptibilities severely shocked, and will use severe measuies and methods to restrain the disturbers of her “peace”; but, fully confident that ‘the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord </span><span class="font3">will give strength unto his people, and bless us with his peace’, we arc gladly taking </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> to the truth-hungry in obedience to God’s commandments, regardless of the opposition and persecution of the “old painted-up woman”, and, by his giace, will continue doing so until the uncircumcised Philistine and all her paraphernalia are relegated to oblivion (where all the wicked will be turned into), mid thus with the zeal of his house we will continue to march forward, and, as we go, will sing our victory song, “The Sword of Jehovah and His Glorious King.” And thus we hail Jehovah God and Christ Jesus the “Higher Poweis”.—Rom. 13: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now, dear Brother Ruthcrfoid, we thank you also for your unselfish service in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord’s </span><span class="font3">loving hand to share in the work of producing this priceless gem </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> for the encouragement of his people at this particular time. Finally, dear brother, “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thee, </span><span class="font3">and give thee peace.”—Num.

<p><span class="font3">Our company is increasing; so it is necessary for us to arrange for larger quarteis. The company is working as a unit as never before, each one eager to do his part as it should be, and we look forward to increasing activity with the PTM and phonographs, as our radio station has been forced off the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How we can see Satan and his visible forces moving forward to the battle, and how every scheme they put fortli to pull themselves out of the dilemma they are in continues to fail! How plain it is lor those of us who walk in the light to see and know why their schemes fail! What a world of contusion' And how the religionists are now beginning to strut around to show off their fine feathers and to ciow and boast about bettering the world!

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutheihord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Words are inadequate to express our appreciation and gratitude for the provisions with which our heavenly Father lias so graciously blessed his “faithful seivant” at this time. It is especially with joy ful hearts that we extend our thanks for the pioneer camp which has been established in the Chicago area. Truly it is as a hornets’ nest in the “land of the Philistines”. We rejoice that while the enemy make sport of the Lord’s children, and though we of ourselves have not the power to “pull down Satan’s house”, we do receive stieirrth to declare his purposes which will accomplish that vety thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a privilege, beyond comprehension, to bo engaged in the full-time service of our loving heavenly Father and to bring to the people the life-sustaining and lite-giving message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are, however, not unmindful of the sacrifices made by our brethren at the Bethel home as well as of your labors of love. We greatly appreciate this even though we do not often express it, yet our hearts are always with you as you continue in your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord is ever mindful of our needs, dear brother, as evidenced by each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which we eagerly look forAard to. And now we are enriched fuithcr bv the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and as we study it we are encouraged to press on in placing this good news of the kingdom in the hands of the great multitude which is coming fortn and engaging in the Lord’s service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">v&gt;'e heard your leeune given on the 2.'ld inst. from Los Angeles, California, together with cheeitul songs of pra&gt;«C3 sung by the assemblies; but because of some disturbances the lecture was not clear to us, and at 8: 15 p.m. it was cut short. But, anyhow, we give praises to Jehovah God for his meicy in granting this broadcast to come across this continent of Africa from such a far distance; this is the Lord’s doing, and is marvelous in our eyes.—Psalm 118: 23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Two years have alicady passed since my writing to you expressing thankfulness to Jehovah and lejoicing with you in having a part in vindication of the name of Jehovah. Now X tejoicc with you in the steady increase of spiritual food which we see in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> at the hand of the Lord; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">rejoice very much.

After reading those I renounced my church and took away my children from the Polish Catholic school and was permitted to open the eyes of my brothers ami sisters after the flesh, and many fiiends of mine are coming to an understanding of the truth. I have prayed for an understanding of the truth, and have received it, and now I can understand better. Dear Brother Rutheiford, I want to thank you for the maivelous truth and clear understanding that you give to the people by the Lord’s grace. I hope I may always be faithful, to the glory of Jehovah God. I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN SERVICE TRUTHS REVEALED ARE VERIFIED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brothlr Huthlrio.'-d:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So many of the statements and phases of work mentioned in recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font3"> and other publications, find immediate corroboration in the witness woik in such an increasing manner of late that X inn thrilled to the coie. Real strength and joy flow from thc=e verified truths. It is m service where the truths revealed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoucr</span><span class="font3"> become real, so leal that they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I only want to mention one phase of expeiienccs: the one having to do with Catholic people. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> the thought is expressed that many of the Catholic population would be freed from the clutch of the Ilieraichy. From past experiences with Catholics I wondered how that was to come about. But I didn’t wonder long. I began to marvel at what I saw! My experiences with many Catholics have been of a manner ex-piessed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yesterday a Catholic woman, after I had intiodueed myself as a J.w., asked me, without having read the card, “Why are our priests against you?” She had read three of our booklets, and said she couldn’t find anything wiong with them. 1 let her hear your excellent answers, then opened the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> book and let her see some of the reasons. To say the least, she was surprised. She said, “To think that I never could see that, makes me feel sick. Why, it is so simple and tiue. ” Her husband, a fanatic. Catholic, had binned the three booklets. Sho took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and said, “He won’t get hold of this one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That woman spoke the language of the class of people so wonderfully described in recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font3"> and in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches. </span><span class="font3">To actually tee and hear these things from outsiders makes theso tiuths live. 1 felt ically happy. I was filled with joy and praises for Jehovah when I left that woman. I had gained as much as she had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus every day in service becomes a source of real strength and joy. I want to express my deep-felt appreciation for the arrangement which makes it possible for us to stay in this wonderful branch of service, where one can be so close to tiuth in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Praise be unto Jehovah for everything. May he strengthen you and bless you richly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow servant for Jehovah,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘CONTINUE WITH YOUR GOOD WORK’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Hltiili:iorii:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greeting! in our Father’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We take this opportunity to express to you our sincere appreciation foi the abundance of n&lt; lies which is contained in the book called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font3"> We aie tiemendou“ly thrilled each day for the piivilege that is ouis in beating this message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While witnessing in Ocean City, N. J., a week ago, we had an intercsting experience which manifested the good will of one of the “strong-arm squad”. An officer accosted us ou the street, and after leading the testimony card and stating th.it he was familiar with the woik, insisted that we were soliciting and should go to the city hall and get a permit. When we refused to do this, he became veiy angiy and called the polite car. Upon the auival of the police car the officer who had aeeosted us did not go with us to the city luill, but instead gave instinct ions to the driver of the car to sign the complaint for him, and stated that this work was compared to anyone’s selling dams or produce. When we armed at the city hall and spoke to the desk sergeant lie likewise was familiar with our work and infused to listen to us, and said, “If you do not want to do as I tell you, then it is your funeral, not mine.” With this lie sent us to the chief. After we had witnessed to the chief he said, “I remember you; you weie at my house yesterday and my wife obtained a book from you. Wait jn=t a minute.” He went to the files and took out our police list nnd letter from the Cape May campaign last summer, and showed these to us. We acknowledged them and told linn this was the same woik. He told us to &lt;ontinue with our good woik and assured us we would not again be interfered with while witnessing in Ocean City. The officer who had in tested us and also the one who had taken us in apologized for any humiha-tion they had caused us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We both unite in sending our sincere Christian love to bo!h you and the Bethel family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH KEEPING US POSTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in the name of our God and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have hesitated writing you sineo I have come to know the Truth, knowing how busy you are. But since your latest broadcast (which is beyond my ability to put into words) I felt I must take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation and gratitude because of your fearlessness in giving Jehovah’s message which has struck fear and terror into the enemy’s camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I was told just last week that we were going to get it soon. In reply I told them that Jehovah is keeping us posted as to the activities of our enemies and that we had nothing to fear. And so my prayer continually is that our God may keep each one who is striving to do as He commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And so my prayer for you, dear brother, is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Lord </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bless</span><span class="font3"> thee, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">keep</span><span class="font3"> thee; the Lord make his face </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shine</span><span class="font3"> upon thee, and be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gi acinus</span><span class="font3"> unto thee the Lord lift up his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">countenance</span><span class="font3"> upon thee, and give thee </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Jehovah’s help and assistance I am with you to the end, even unto death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN HARMONY WITH THE DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We, the Lakeland (Fla.) company of Jehovah’s witnesses, by motion unanimously passed, hare expressed ourselves in harmony with the Declaration adopted by the woild-widc convention of the people of Jehovah on February 23, 1936, and we heieby resolve that,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wo are mindful that the war is on to the finish of the enemy, and notice is now served on the Devil and his chief earthly agent, the llieiarehy at Rome, and her allies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“That we will not stultify ourselves by compromising with or yielding to the enemy’s demands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Our trust is wholly in Jehovah and his King, and we will attiibute salvation to none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is our privilege and duty to serve Jehovah, following the lead of his Faithful and True Witness, and this, by lus giace, we will do. If because of our faithfulness vve die nt the enemy’s hands, we die! If wo survive, it will be as loyal subjects of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah’s Vindicator cannot be defeated, and by his giace and in pcrfoimanee of our covenant we will follow him into the very jaws of death, being fully confident that God will preserve our everlasting existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“With the zeal of his house we will continue to march forward, and as we go we will joyfully sing our victory song: </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The eword of Jehovah and his glorious Kino!’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JONADABS REJOICE TO HAVE PART</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I enclose a copy of the resolution which was unanimously adopted by the Jonadabs in Brookfield, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This was their first time out in the field. After working a little while four were arrested, including myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We were tried the following day and convicted and fined ten dollars each. The case was appealed to a higher court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We were permitted to read the entire Statement contained in the Order of Trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the conclusion of the “trial’’ the judge stated: “We are going to be omnipotent in Brookfield and fine you ten dollars each. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We rejoice to have a little part in the witness work and pray that we may also have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wishing you the Lord’s rich blessing, I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We realize now that the real joy is in active service, and desire to be loyal and faithful for evermore.</span></p>

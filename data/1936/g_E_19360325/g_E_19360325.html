<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The World-wide Assembly of February 23, 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Convention in Los Angeles</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE were approximately 6,000 people at</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the public lecture given by Judge Rutherford, and between 4,000 and 4,500 for his second talk, at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. During the remainder of the convention the attendance varied between 2,500 and 3,500. These were registered from 27 different states and three Canadian provinces. It was a very enthusiastic assembly, and all were richly blessed by having a large share in the field service and in the Lord’s bountiful provision, particularly Judge Rutherford’s lectures on Sunday.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 There was never an assembly of any people | | on earth like the great assembly of the people | | of Jehovah God on February 21-24, 1936. The | i assembly began at Los Angeles February 21. | | It ended In Australia and New Zealand Feb- | I ruary 24, a day later than It ended in Los 1 I Angeles, as men count time, though actually i I it ended at the same Instant. When Judge | I Rutherford finished his second address, on f | “Feasts”, the convention wds over. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I Imagine a convention with such a record of | I convention activities as is provided in the | I accompanying table shown on page 402. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| This provides a definite and wholly satis- | f factory plan for the future convention activ- § | ities of Jehovah’s people. Who would ever f | have supposed that at almost the same In- | | stant, throughout the earth, some 10,000 of | | Jehovah’s people would be calling at the | | homes of the people with the message of | | God’s kingdom, and a little later would at 1 | actually the same instant be listening to the | I &nbsp;same Inspiring and Instructive lectures from &nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;the Word of God, by the one Jehovah God</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;has placed in the body of Christ at this time</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;to direct the work of His faithful and true</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 witnesses in the earth?</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| Take note of the fact that by this arrange- | | ment there was ample territory for each | | worker: it was not necessary to drive 70 f | miles to find people to whom to witness, nor 1 | to call on the same people more than once | | within a day or two. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 The reports of the various assemblies are | | presented herewith, from west to east, as far | = as they have come In up to the time of go- f 1 ing to press. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">During the public address the entire audience sat on the edge of their seats, as they were afraid of missing even one sentence. At the close their outburst of applause and their enthusiastic shout of “Aye” indicated complete accord of everyone present with what had been said from the platform. Never at any convention, without exception, did the audience rise in the manner they did here and shout “Aye”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford’s second speech was received with even greater enthusiasm, if possible. The vision of the Lord’s Feast and the privilege of having some part in it thrilled the hearts of all present. No effort is here made, of course, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">describe the talk to you who were privileged </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">listen to it yourselves, or will see it subsequently in the Society’s literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The field service was very good. There were approximately 1,500 who had a part in it. This, in addition to the great many who had to work in and around the auditorium, accounted for practically all who were at the convention during the first two days. Of course, many came in on Sunday who did not have any part in the service in the Los Angeles area, but undoubtedly worked with their own company until the meeting time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 63 books and 17,975 booklets placed in the house-to-house witnessing, in 12,176 homes. The accumulated time amounted to 4,856 hours. At the public meeting there were 29 books and 529 booklets placed. The publishers were received very well throughout the territory. Practically everyone called upon expressed himself as being aware of the fact that the convention was on, and appeared sufficiently interested to tune in to the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many expressions were heard by the publishers on Monday as they called on the people from house to house, saying that they listened to the lecture and that they were in full accord with it. There were, of course, some exceptions, but this was the general expression. There was a very marked increase in the expressions of good will from the people noted and reported by those in the field. The setting in the auditorium was magnificent. The main auditorium seats close to 6,000 people. It has a massive stage, 196 feet long and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">approximately 100 feet deep. It was possible for Judge Rutherford to drive his car on the stage behind the curtain without any difficulty, as well as other cars that were being used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the front part of the platform there was a tremendous display of palms and flowers extending more than one-third of the way from each wing. This provided an ideal setting of natural beauty for the lecture. Over the speaker’s head and across the front of the mulberrycolored heavy plush curtain was a large sign, 50 feet long, with the words “Separating the Nations”, which kept the issue continually before the minds of the audience until it was time for the lecture to start. Then no reminder was necessary. The thrilling address itself held them spellbound.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360325_files/g_E_19360325-2.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:167pt;">
<p><span class="font5">The setting in the Auditorium was magnificent.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In the pit in front of the stage provision was made for the deaf and hard of hearing. The Acousticon Institute for the hard of hearing loaned the convention at Los Angeles a Group Hearing Aid sufficient for 200. Only 70 required it. It is comprised of individual equipment for each one, enabling them to sit in their seats, put on this head gear, and listen to the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This equipment provides for its own amplification. There was a microphone placed on the platform in front of the speaker, which picked up the voice, carried it through their particular amplifying system and then fed it to the different equipments. The hearts of the 70 who were thus privileged to hear all of the lectures were thrilled, and tears streamed down the cheeks of many, as this was undoubtedly the first time many of the hard of hearing were able to hear perfectly every word without straining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one of the boxes provision was made for the deaf and dumb. They were all assembled in one box, where they had one competent transmitter to listen and transmit the lecture to them by the sign language. As far as humanly possible provisions were made for every requirement, and all in attendance were extremely happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford had been very ill during the week previous. In fact, when he arrived in Los Angeles he did not appear in any condition to undertake the strenuous work of the two meetings before him on Sunday. However, he went at it in the strength of the Lord and his hearers throughout the world as well as here will testify that he never sounded better on the air, or his voice clearer and more distinct than in both broadcasts on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were many interesting experiences. One of the events that brought down the house at the close of the public meeting was some lady present who apparently was a Catholic up to that time. After hearing Judge Rutherford's talk she jumped up and yelled, “To hell with the pope from now on! Where is the contribution box?” That was a source of much merriment, but it really expressed also the manner in which the forceful presentation of the truth regarding the Catholic Hierarchy must have hit the people of good will or honest-hearted ones among the Catholic population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">was quite tired after the first meeting, but after a rest it seemed that the relief that resulted from the fact that the first meeting was over, and went so well, refreshed him and he came back for the evening meeting in fine fettle and his talk on “Feasts” thrilled the hearts of everyone here, and, undoubtedly, throughout the earth. Everybody here is extremely happy for having had some part in the convention and all look forward with great joy to the privilege of partaking in this “Feast of Tabernacles” Jehovah’s people will share together. This will undoubtedly manifest itself in real activity in the distribution of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> book in the coming campaign. [See page 416.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were approximately 175 pioneers present from Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Utah and Washington. These came by various means. There were 16 house-cars and trailers, and there were three groups who came </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">cars and lived in tents on the grounds. There </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were 21 </span><span class="font7">sound cars, most of them brought by pioneers. Adequate provisions were made for these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s people in Los Angeles provided rooming accommodations free for all of the pioneers who required such. All in house-cars lived on the parking space, and all necessary provisions of that nature were supplied free. Meals also were provided free, and some of the pioneers who were financially unable to return home were aided in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Literature was provided by the Society depot representative, so they were enabled to get what they required. This was a decided aid for the pioneers who came long distances and had their cars filled to capacity in order to reduce the expense of traveling and there was not much room left for carrying literature. The Los Angeles company put forth a very strenuous effort to make everything as convenient and as comfortable as possible for these.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360325_files/g_E_19360325-3.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:212pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">There were 23 sound cars registered. However, only 21 of them reported. Two had difficulty in getting their cars into the state, due to faulty registration, or something of that nature. By Thursday evening 18 of the 21 sound cars were on the job broadcasting the announcement record “Separating the Nations” in different parts of the city. The evenings were devoted to checking up on their equipment and making arrangements for radio pickups so that they could be used for rebroadcasting the lecture on Sunday in sections of the city where the people were too poor to own radios.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friday evening there was a meeting of the sound-car operators, where the operation and equipment was discussed freely. It was found the majority of the operators were broadcasting too loudly. A practical demonstration was then given so that a uniform and reasonably loud presentation of the lecture was possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everything was arranged in advance, and by Sunday the 21 cars assigned for duty were able to pick up and rebroadcast the lecture clearly at their respective locations. The comments heard by the operators and indicated in their reports were very interesting. Space will not permit enumerating these here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work of advertising this convention was very well taken care of. 500,000 handbills sent by the Society were received and all distributed by Saturday night in the house-to-house work; it was not necessary to have any downtown distribution. Radio broadcast announcements were also arranged for over six radio stations at the time of the day when the largest number of radio listeners were supposed to be tuned in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 600 placards on the outside of the Los Angeles street cars, so everywhere you went these placards were in sight. These were large cards 21 by 26 inches, and were very effective. Also, 500 placards were placed in store windows throughout the city, and there was hardly anywhere you went that you did not run across some of them after a short walk; and 1,400 cards were placed on automobiles and in store windows, houses and lawns of the various brethren throughout the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to this there were 12 lines of banners strung across the streets in the vicinity of the Shrine Auditorium. The photograph enclosed covering this hardly does justice to the effectiveness of this means of advertising; for it really was very effective and no one passing that vicinity could help but notice them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Billboard advertising was also used. A commercial moving billboard 24 by 9 J feet with powerful sound equipment was employed. This moving billboard drove along the boulevards and avenues and used the convention record as announcement. During the evenings it was used in the downtown sections. It was brilliantly illuminated; consequently it could be easily read and was quite noticeable. On Saturday afternoon it was used at the Santa Anita Race Tracks just as the crowd was leaving the races, and the crowds that attended the races were advised that something worth while was going on in their vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the large billboard, five other billboards of various sizes were used and driven through the streets of the city. A permit was obtained for the use of these. There was a joker in the permit, to this effect: It stated that all moving billboards must have sound equipment installed. With the number of transcription machines available, this was meat for the operators here, and, naturally, they used them effectively; for each one of these moving billboards went through the city with the transcription machine and the advertising record.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360325_files/g_E_19360325-4.png" alt="" style="width:230pt;height:156pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">There was an immersion service provided for as a part of the convention; and 139 symbolized their consecration by water immersion. A feature of this was that the talk covering this service was the 4J-minute lecture by Judge Rutherford on this subject, which is complete and to the point, and enabled the brethren to get a clear presentation of this matter in a few minutes and was much preferable to the long-winded talks that formerly marked this event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The physical man had to be provided for, and this was excellently taken care of in the cafeteria arrangement. Jehovah’s people worked long and hard to make this a success, and the unanimous approval of all who were served in the cafeteria was a clear indication that all were more than satisfied. There was a total of 8,122 meals served during the entire convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cafeteria itself had a seating capacity of 700, so that with the exception of the time immediately after Judge Rutherford’s first talk there was no time when there was anything near </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">congestion, and even on that occasion there was only about 15 minutes of congestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were used approximately 1,000 pounds of meat, 125 gallons of milk, about 100 gallons of ice cream, 60 pounds of coffee, approximately 400 loaves of bread, and over 100 dozen doughnuts, wiener rolls, and smaller pieces. Of course, this being so close to the Mexican border, a cafeteria could not be complete without tamales; and the report shows 16 dozen of these were consumed. Fresh fruit and vegetables were in abundance, and all of this was provided at </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">very reasonable rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The music for the convention was all confined to the organ. The Shrine Auditorium has one of the largest organs on earth, and it sounded wonderful. One of Jehovah’s witnesses handled the instrument very ably. Song service was under the leadership of a competent witness and all joined in heartily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The declaration meetings were also well participated in, although limited muchmorethan usual, due to the fact that practical instruction in service work reporting, how to meet the public, and other items that could be used practically and advantageously in the house-to-house witnessing, was, in many cases, substituted for the declarations. Service, not talk, is the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One meeting was devoted to discussion of electric signs, which was also received very enthusiastically by the audience. Of the audience 378 indicated that they desired this equipment, and at that particular meeting it could hardly be said that more than 50 percent of the convention was in attendance, and undoubtedly after Judge Rutherford's talk, part of which was an exhortation to the people of God to come out and show themselves, many more will appreciate the advantage of having these signs to identify them as being for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is an even greater outstanding point, however, which is emphasized by the many expressions on the part of the brethren that they earnestly hope that in Jehovah’s provision this manner of assembly may be repeated in the future. This point is the fact wliich this convention demonstrated probably more than any other assembly of the Lord’s people: that they are in this fight, not to serve any man or any creature, but because they love the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the largest and most enthusiastic conventions that Kansas City has had has just been concluded. The convention did not officially open until Saturday, yet there were present at the Friday evening meeting approximately 475 publishers, and at the first meeting Saturday morning about 600 were present. Of this number, 363 turned in reports of field service. Taking into consideration the distance the friends drove and the time spent obtaining room accommodations and instructions, there was a nice morning of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weather in Kansas City for several weeks past has been extremely cold; in fact, too severe for the friends to be out. Sub-zero weather prevailed until Thursday. But Saturday morning was as nice as spring, and the same continued over Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conventioners, together with the local company, did a real job of advertising, and every method suggested by the Society was used. A number of sound cars (about 30) were in the service with car cards and the special announcement record, and these covered the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was one group of cars used in advertising that proved to be very effective. Four cars were used with a large painted sign on both sides of each car. The first car carried signs with the words “Separating the Nations”. This was a sound car, to attract attention. The second car, running a reasonable distance behind the first, had signs “Hear Judge Rutherford”. The third car signs read “Sunday 2 p.m. February 23”; and the fourth car signs read “Kansas City Radio Stations KWKC and W9XBY”. This particular idea of advertising seemed to be especially effective, from the reports that were heard by the friends from the public with whom they came in contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The friends succeeded in distributing 100,000 announcement slips; and each car carried at least one placard, and most of them had two and three placards. These cards were placed in prominent places in Kansas City and in all the small towns of the Kansas City territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wire connections at the hall were very efficient, the convention building being thoroughly covered by loud-speakers with microphone connections which enabled speakers to address the entire convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meals were provided in the building, making </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font7">very convenient for the workers. Hot meals, as well as sandwiches, were served, and the Kansas City company deemed it a real pleasure to be able to provide meals for the pioneers without cost. Over eleven hundred free meals were served free of charge to pioneers and those working in the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The room committee had things especially well in hand, free lodging being provided pioneers in most cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hospital service was provided with at least two doctors and one registered nurse on hand at all times, and competent women in attendance. A great number of pioneers received treatment (chiropractic and osteopathic) without charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Sunday morning there were about 700 present at the opening, at 9 o’clock, and 684 publishers went in the service. They put in 1,703 hours. They returned shortly after noon and preparations were made for the afternoon lecture at 2 o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were approximately 1,250 present in the main auditorium and adjoining rooms. Very close attention was given throughout the entire talk, and there was no interference. The pioneers placed considerable literature with the public who had come in, and all were given a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font7"> booklet as they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immediately after the afternoon talk an immersion service was held, and 46 symbolized their consecration to do God’s will for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In checking over the names of those who attended the convention the following states were represented: Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, South Dakota, Colorado, California, and Iow<sup>T</sup>a; also Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the evening for Judge Rutherford’s talk at six o’clock there were 1,150 present; and as the friends disbanded wonderful expressions of enthusiasm were noted on all sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report of service for the convention was as follows: Publishers 1,047; hours 2,483; books 3; booklets 8,958; obtainers 5,949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sound equipment report: Hours 70; machines 24; attendance 7,840.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This does not include the work done by the parade of four cars, which proved extremely effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the local newspapers, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal-Post, gave</span><span class="font7"> us some splendid write-up. We had two news items, one 1,000-word editorial, and we placed with them about ten inches of advertising. This was all run before the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font7">MILING faces, that joyful look, was the predominating appearance of all those attending the Chicago convention. All there knew that they were one part of a great assembly of Jehovah’s organization. They were anxious to obtain their assignment and do whatever work there was in connection with the advertising of the King and Kingdom. Their assignment this time was the advertising of the public lecture “Separating the Nations” and the placing of literature with the people so that they might take their stand on the side of the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the opening of the convention Saturday morning, more than 450 publishers were equipped with literature, a good bundle of public meeting announcements, some with phonographs, all waiting to move into action. A large battery of sound equipment was on hand, and after a short meeting all went forward to advertise the greatest lecture of all times. At 9: 30 there were none left in the auditorium, except a few caretakers to assist those who were just arriving to find rooms and make assignments for the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Good cafeteria arrangements were made for the feeding of the witnesses at no cost, including a box lunch. Large counters with good food were set up for the convenience of the workers, and all helped themselves and made such contributions as they desired to defray expenses. The pioneers appreciated this greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Praise and Declaration meetings were devoted entirely to ways and means of better advertising the Kingdom. The various equipment which the Lord had brought to His people, such as radio, phonographs, sound cars, books, booklets, magazines and other equipment w<sup>T</sup>as discussed, then a new means of advertising was brought to the attention of the convention, the electric sign. This was accepted with great enthusiasm and all were thrilled with this new method of advertising and identifying themselves particularly with Jehovah’s organization, which this sign will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very helpful suggestions were offered as to the use of the various equipment placed in our hands. The discourses delivered at the Chicago convention by those delegates sent by the Society were based on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our one big objective was to inform the people of the lecture “Separating the Nations”. On Saturday evening there were more than </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">800 </span><span class="font7">present, and there was much advertising to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">done after 8: 30, and the brethren responded to this with great enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the placards that were available were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ar</span><span class="font7">ranged into “sandwich signs” and the brethren walked for miles through the “Loop” section of Chicago, some two by two, others singly. All the sound cars drove through the downtown sections. Other cars with signs also advertised by moving about the city in congested areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than 500 took a good supply of folders announcing the lecture and went into the downtown crowded sections to distribute to the passers-by. One man was heard to say, “This is the fifth time I have been handed one of these, and now I am going to read it.” It takes a long time to drum an idea into some hard heads. The people knew that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Chicago company made splendid arrangements for the convention in advance and obtained the Civic Opera House, a beautiful structure. This auditorium was practically filled with 2,600 persons, who listened with rapt attention to Judge Rutherford. The absence of the speaker had no effect upon the audience. They were there to hear the truth, which was surely delivered in a masterly fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was noticed that when mention was made of that lying religious organization by its official title “Roman Catholic Hierarchy”, a half dozen persons left the auditorium. In modern phrase, one would say “They couldn’t take it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the close of the meeting there was such a shout of “Aye” that rang throughout the corridors and hallways that it could be heard even to the streets. A goodly number of persons took literature, turned in their names, and came back to hear Judge Rutherford’s lecture Sunday night at the convention hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the witnesses attending the Chicago convention were now keyed up and awaiting with keen anticipation the evening program, and they certainly were blessed beyond words with the message Jehovah provided for them at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There seemed to be one round of applause after another, and when the declaration was read there was a shout, a hearty applause, and all stood on their feet more determined than ever to go down the line on the Lord’s side, tak-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ing the message to the “great multitude”. Nothing under the sun could stop that organization from going forward to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following message was immediately sent </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford: “Overjoyed and comfort</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font7">with 'Feasts’ message. Jehovah continue to direct you. 1700 unanimously endorse declaration. Appreciate greatly greeting sent to us. We </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font7"> turn greet you heartily and hail Jehovah and His King. 817 publishers, 16 sound cars, distribution nearly 10,000. Chicago Convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report of the work accomplished in the field was very gratifying. There were 817 publishers engaging in the work during Saturday and Sunday. They placed 58 bound books, 9,274 booklets, and each of the publishers averaged 4 hours in the field work. This literature was placed in the hands of 4,503 obtainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every means was employed to advertise the public lecture by sound equipment. There were 11 phonographs reported used, 7 portable transcription machines, and 16 sound cars. In and about Chicago there were 135,785 persons reported to have heard the announcement by means of sound equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many instances the phonographs were taken into big business houses, offices, factories, and other places, and interesting experiences were related. Calling on an executive of a large firm, the executive invited the pioneer to run the announcement record. He placed the phonograph on the table in the waiting room and left his door open. In the waiting room there were 25 other persons who listened attentively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a small factory a witness spoke to the manager, who said, “Well, the factory force might as well hear, too”; so they called all the factory employees, numbering around 20, into the office and a splendid witness was given. Jehovah affords His people many opportunities of witnessing, and certainly the advertising of “Separating the Nations” afforded all of us an extraordinary privilege in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah really performed a miracle in the arranging of the weather from sub-zero for a whole month to 40° above zero Sunday. The use of the radio, and many stations throughout the world, which were obtained through great difficulty, further proved the Lord’s direction. It was the Lord’s doing and marvelous in our eyes. The witnesses assembled at Chicago were overjoyed with this new arrangement and look forward to many such gatherings in the future.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Convention</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font7">ARLY last year the Birmingham company asked the Society for a convention with Judge Rutherford present. This request was turned down because Judge Rutherford could not be here personally. We had about given up hopes of having a convention, when we received information concerning one of the most unique convention arrangements ever dreamed of. AH were thrilled beyond words at the privilege. Committees were immediately appointed and the machinery set in motion to carry out the suggestions as outlined by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The City Auditorium was already engaged for another meeting, and the next largest auditorium, the Temple Theatre, was secured for the convention assembly. But we were refused the Temple dining room, for some reason or another. But we did not want to be outdone; so a fairly large storeroom was secured and volunteers hastily constructed benches, and other necessary equipment was installed for the J.w. cafeteria.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>in Birmingham</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Temporary offices were established, and many were notified by card of such arrangements. On Thursday they began to arrive, some from Texas, some from North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and, in fact, all the southeastern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The winter in the south had been the most severe in history, and the committee hardly knew what to plan; but, knowing that Jehovah’s people do not fear the weather, plans were made for about 2,OCX). And we did not miss our guess very much; for by Sunday more than 2,000 were on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Sunday morning 1,015 participated in the service. The total literature placed for the two days is as follows: bound books 50, booklets 12,500; hours 3,700; recipients 7,100; sound-car hours 60, people reached 17,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The main feature of the convention was Judge Rutherford’s address to all the earth on “Separating the Nations”. Approximately 3,000 per-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 307)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S blessing was certainly manifest upon the Cleveland (Ohio) division of the great international convention and the strenuous efforts which the conventioners put forth to make this a success and accomplish a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reception of both the afternoon and evening discourses by Judge Rutherford was splendid, every word being audible to every one throughout the assembly; three auditoriums were used for the lecture “Separating the Nations”. All assembled at the main Masonic auditorium for “Feasts”. A large crowd of 4,500 heard “Separating the Nations”, and the evening attendance was 3,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That to which the witnesses had long looked forward and which constituted the high points of the convention were, of course, the two lectures by Judge Rutherford. With one accord the assemblies fully supported the resolution called to their attention. That the witnesses have a keener appreciation of their position and responsibility because of the message brought to them, there is no question, and these two lectures have been of untold value to the Lord’s people. They appreciate this, and so expressed their appreciation to Judge Rutherford, to the Society, and, above all, to Jehovah, who directs His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effectiveness of this type of convention was marked by everyone, and the witnesses earnestly desire for this to be repeated in Jehovah’s provision. Never has such an enthusiastic assembly of the Lord’s people been held; the activities of the convention accomplished a splendid witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cumulative total of publishers for the tw<sup>r</sup>o days was 3,088, 2,047 being in the field on Sunday. A total of 15,531 pieces of literature, of which 15,478 were booklets, was placed with 10,110 obtainers, in 6,032 hours; this in a territory that is thoroughly covered every few weeks. There were 704 automobiles in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to consistent advertising of the lecture by means of the sound machines prior to the convention, a total of 20 sound cars were in use on Sunday, the 23d, for rebroadcast purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the 4,500 persons assembled at the convention to hear “Separating the Nations”, there was an estimated attendance of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">100 at each rebroadcast setup, or 2,000 hearing the lecture by this means, in addition to the unlimited number who took advantage of the radio broadcast in their own homes, WJAY covering the territory in a most satisfactory manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the 300,000 advertising leaflets supplied by the Society, delegates from other companies brought great quantities of these with them, which were distributed by the convention. The 1,500 placards furnished by the Society were used in store windows and augmented by 600 printed locally, in addition to 200 signs in street cars. Large banners were raised on public streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new electric signs demonstrated at the convention were received with enthusiastic applause, everyone apparently desiring these, and cash orders were taken for 238 in addition to four samples which were left. Arrangements were made for all the witnesses to order their supply of electric signs through their local service director upon returning home following the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The beautiful Masonic auditorium where the Sunday afternoon sessions were held is one of the best in the land for acoustic purposes. The public-address system took the convention sessions to all parts of the building, including the cafeteria hall and the kitchens, so that all could hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cafeteria served approximately 18,000 meals of the finest food. The crowd was much larger than anticipated, but was supplied by the cafeteria most satisfactorily, and the convention arrangements throughout demonstrate what can be accomplished when workers co-operate closely, working in harmony to the success of the Lord’s work. Everyone was anxious to fully perform his or her part in the convention service; there were more than sufficient volunteers for every feature of the work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the weather moderated so that the two days of the convention were very pleasant in this respect. Up until the conventioners began to assemble prior to the convention there was bitter cold accompanied by snow and sleet throughout the large section of the country from which they came. While the bad roads were a considerable handicap, large numbers were in attendance from the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Indiana, and some from more distant points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">r</span><span class="font7">i Pittsburgh, Pa., every effort was made to make Judge Rutherford’s public speech the most heralded and widely advertised event that Jehovah’s witnesses have had the privilege of calling to the attention of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The division here decided it wanted the best hall available, and secured Syria Mosque, the finest hall in Pittsburgh. With the securing of almost a third of a million radio folders work began in earnest. This was augmented by eighteen thousand blotters with a cut of the speaker thereon and notice of the lecture, which were distributed throughout the office buildings; twenty-five full-length banners for atop automobiles, and additional signs for bumpers and for windows in cars; also two sound cars and phonograph records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Added to this were three banners for placing across the main intersections here. A real fight ensued on account of the close proximity of one of these to a three-million-dollar church building recently built by the late R. B. Mellon. As the workers began to hoist the banner, the minister of the church came out. Hardly noticing what was going on, he passed by. Just as the banner was hung he came around the corner. Sighting the banner he almost stumbled over himself as he darted into a bank, doubtless to call up the officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That he did so was soon evident, as the Pittsburgh service director was soon called by the city railway official, who stated the preacher was furious. The director asked the official if he thought it would be well for him to call on the preacher and learn his objections, and the official replied in the affirmative. The interview took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preacher, thinking the director and his assistant were from the railway official’s headquarters, started on a tirade, “That sign is coming down; that Rutherford, he had that sign put there just to make us mad. He took up the reins where Pastor Russell left off. Russell was so bad they would not permit him to be buried in Pennsylvania. By the way, whom do you represent?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The director replied, “I am a representative of the Watch Tower.” The business manager’s knees buckled. The preacher asked the director’s assistant, “Whom do you represent?” He re</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">plied, “I </span><span class="font7">am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, too.” The preacher’s right hand went to his forehead and his left sought support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The director then advised that all the preacher had just stated was lies, and that he would see that the sign was taken down, as he didn’t want it at that place anyway. The city officials then gave permission to have it hung farther up the street. Three days later it disappeared. It was finally located, and permission was given to hang it at another point, nearer the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two days later it disappeared again. It was again located, and permission was granted to place it at a very good location near Syria Mosque. This is mentioned to show the fairness with which the city railway officials tried to act and the extreme viciousness of the ally of the “church of the Philistines”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pittsburgh had some terrible winter weather this year, but the first day of the convention came with a break in the severe weather, and Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon were bright and ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Saturday, at 4: 45 p.m., the conventioners were thrilled with the “dress rehearsal” and anticipated the greater thrill of the morrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the zero hour reached on Sunday afternoon there were approximately 2,500 people assembled, thrilled with the Lord’s message as it proceeded from the lips of Judge Rutherford. The audience arose en masse and exclaimed “Aye” in favor of the resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Delegates assembled were from points as remote as Huntington, W. Va., and Indianapolis, Ind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The praise services on the program were utilized by symposiums on the various features—• phonograph work and sound equipment. A pioneer’s remarks on tact, diplomacy, discretion, etc., in connection with sound-car work were well put and timely, showing how many times victory can be snatched from seeming defeat by acting in a manner that is worthy of an ambassador of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were approximately a thousand workers in the service work on Sunday, and workers spoke of enthusiastic experiences from individuals who were waiting for them to call at their home, and car drivers who reported placing all their literature and being thereby forced to quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The evening broadcast of Judge Rutherford’s talk to the friends on “Feasts” was received with cheer and appreciation by about 1,300. It was next only to having Judge Rutherford with the conventioners personally. Hand clapping at intervals could not be suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE week prior to the convention, when the intensive work of advertising Judge Rutherford’s public lecture had to be done, the temperature persisted at the zero mark and below. But, despite this, the publishers proceeded to carry out the work. Many frost-bitten noses and fingers testified to the willing service performed. All together, 150,000 handbills were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So that their friends and neighbors would be advised of the momentous occasion Jehovah’s people took eighty-five streamers which had been prepared with announcements of the broadcast, and prominently displayed these on their verandas. Store windows provided a convenient place to display window cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the street cars busily covered their routes 200 of them carried the notice, and eleven double-sided signs placed on the tops of automobiles advised- all who read that the event of Sunday was the lecture on “Separating the Nations”. Two Toronto newspapers covering local sections of the city carried outstanding quarterpage advertisements of the lecture, together with write-ups (of good length) giving fuller information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To cap the work of advertising the lecture a hundred or more publishers acting as “sandwich men” walked up and down the main streets on Saturday evening with placards back and front, advertising the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So that the Catholic people of good will might Take their flight’ before “winter” sets in, all the cars with large signs paraded outside the prominent Catholic churches, and at 10:30 on Sunday morning, when the worshipers were leaving, the cars were so located as to attract the attention of the honest-hearted and to advise them of their opportunity to hear the afternoon witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Naturally, some who prefer to serve Satan heard and saw also, and in one instance several young men jumped upon the running board of a publisher’s car and attempted to cut the guy ropes and thus bring down the sign. They did not succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the greatly appreciated features of the convention was the cafeteria. Having in mind that good soldiers require to be fed on wholesome and convenient temporal as well as spiritual food, the committee arranged that the cafeteria should be run on a contributory basis. This meant that pioneers and others of limited financial means were free to have all the necessary meals without charge, while those blessed by </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Lord with greater affluence were able to contribute in proportion to their ability. Many </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font7">pressed appreciation of the efficient service, and the thoughtful provision made for their welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Over icy and snow-blocked roads pioneers and company publishers traveled, some from three hundred miles distant, to take part in this concentrated witness. Captains from the local company were appointed to guide the visiting witnesses to their territory and look after reports, etc. Under the captains 274 publishers took part in the field service during the two days. They worked 746 hours, leaving with the interested public 3,075 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people in and about Montreal, Quebec, did not need to attend the Toronto assembly to hear Judge Rutherford’s speeches by direct wire connection with Los Angeles. A telephone line, tied in with the transcontinental system, carried the judge’s voice to an auditorium in Verdun, Montreal Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just previous to the public broadcast by Judge Rutherford, the Canadian Radio Commission, which, of course, does not carry any communications from Jehovah’s witnesses, were besieged with calls from those desiring to hear the lecture, endeavoring to find out the stations which were carrying the talk, in Canada. These calls became so numerous that the Canadian Radio Commission was in turn forced to seek information from the telephone company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The public address system of six speakers used in the auditoriums in Toronto was made by the Lord’s people and most effectively served to give forth the message as it came from the telephone lines. The equipment carried the speaker’s voice clearly and easily to every part of the auditoriums and was heard without any echo or interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty-five hundred or more people, after listening intently to the speech “Separating the Nations”, loyally and enthusiastically rose to their feet in response to the request of the speaker that all who desired to take their stand on the side of Jehovah so signify by standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This public speech so interested those of the public present that many of them accepted the invitation, which was extended to each one present on the free programs distributed, and returned to hear Judge Rutherford’s later speech, on “Feasts”, thus swelling the attendance of the conventioners to a total of 1,477 at that hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">T Baltimore, Md., a great witness was made to the supremacy of the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">Richmond Street Armory was filled with upward of a thousand enthusiastic listeners to the speech by Judge Rutherford, brought to the auditorium by direct wire from Los Angeles, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the speaker gave all the opportunity to express their fealty to Jehovah and His King, Christ Jesus, every person stood up and lustily shouted “Aye”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The epoch-making speech “Separating the Nations” was broadcast by Baltimore station WCBM. Splendid reception was had from the station, which had the courage to broadcast the speech in its entirety. A number of sound cars, as well as autos with specially amplified radios, “picked up” the speech from WCBM and ‘rebroadcast’ from strategic points in different parts of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many listeners in the surrounding homes thus heard this thrilling speech. It was interesting to note that, although the temperature hovered around zero, many stood in the cold and listened throughout the entire broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The police department of Baltimore gave excellent co-operation, providing a police escort for each sound car and radio-equipped automobile. A number of these patrolmen expressed themselves as being fully sympathetic with the judge’s remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A rather amusing incident, yet indicative of the awakening of a great multitude of people of good will, was when Judge Rutherford invited all who were desirous of expressing their allegiance to Jehovah to join in the shout of “Aye”. Two of Jehovah’s witnesses operating the sound car shouted “Aye”. All at once one of the officers escorting the sound car suddenly raised his voice, slapped the palm of his hand with his fist, and shouted at the top of his voice, “Me too 1” Never was any campaign more widely advertised. Every available means was used to advertise the message of the hour, the actual work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses themselves. Patiently, yet with hearts filled with gladness, they went from door to door telling, to everyone who would listen, about the importance of the broadcast that was to go to the ends of the earth, declaring the message from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weather was very cold, but that didn’t stop them. Old men and young men, old women </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">young women, youths and maidens, moved</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">forward as one. Sound cars, radio-equipped automobiles, phonographs, handbills, personal conversation and door-to-door witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five hundred publishers advertising the message of the Kingdom. They spent fifteen hundred hours in the service of the Lord out in the “field”. Eight thousand books and booklets were gladly received by the people of good will who were visited at their homes. Six thousand of such there were who received Jehovah’s witnesses gladly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Birmingham, continued from page 393) </span><span class="font7">sons were in the visible audience, and it was a deafening roar when all as one man shouted “Aye” to the resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The public-address system was as clear as a bell. A telephone loop was installed connecting the cafeteria with the Temple Theatre so that all who labored there might hear all the programs without going to the Temple Theatre. Judge Rutherford’s voice was as clear as if he were in the room personally. Many were heard to say, “This is the best convention ever,” and, “That was the hardest blow the Devil ever had.” At the conclusion the following telegram was immediately dispatched to Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“With a thrill of joy and thanksgiving approximately three thousand in Temple Theatre heard Jehovah’s message to all on earth. All stood and shouted ‘Aye’ at conclusion. God bless you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the message to all on earth was not all. The great Jehovah had a special message for His people, and that was brought to them by direct wire from Los Angeles at 6:00 p.m., Birmingham time. This was a special feast and was appreciated by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From expressions heard among the Lord’s people, all appreciate more than ever the great issue that is before them, their responsibility, and the nearness of the final conflict and the overthrow of the Devil and his entire organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No murmurers or disgruntled ones seemed to be present. Everything went along in the best of order, peace and rejoicing. All of which bespeaks that the Lord has unified His people; harmony and oneness of action characterizes the movement of His army, presenting a united and solid front against the enemy and for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We lift up our hearts in praise to the great Jehovah, who doeth all things well.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S blessing was very manifest upon the New York session of the Los Angeles convention. Judge Rutherford’s two talks climaxed two days of the most intensive advertising for the King and Kingdom ever done in this city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Mecca Temple, with a capacity of 3,500, was almost filled Sunday afternoon for the lecture “Separating the Nations”. The entire audience listened attentively, and when the resolution was announced, a great shout of “Aye” was heard. In addition, 8,300 heard the lecture rebroadcast through the sound ears, making the total visible audience over 11,000. Judge Rutherford’s evening talk was surely “a feast”; approximately 2,500 present at this meeting were thrilled to hear this message from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Field activity for the two days is here summarized: Publishers, on Saturday 743, Sunday 1,307; literature placed, books 140, booklets 21,537; hours in door-to-door witnessing, 5,154; average hours per publisher, 4. A total of 11,218 people received literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 28 sound cars and 63 phonographs in use during the convention. These spent a total of 308 hours in service. Those who heard the announcement of “Separating the Nations” and the rebroadcast of the lecture totaled 531,955. The operators of the sound cars placed 679 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Advertising “Separating the Nations” was done on a grand scale. In New York city about 600,000 folders announcing the broadcast were distributed. Two thousand placards were used. Hundreds of additional signs were painted for sound cars, automobiles, and other places that would attract attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a spectacular “sandwich-sign” parade Saturday afternoon and evening in the busy midtown section. About 400 “sandwich signs” were used. Such a sign consists of two placards tied together, and strapped around one’s body, one placard in front and one in back. Volunteers quickly responded for this privilege of service. In fact, many more signs could have been used; some of the witnesses went with only one sign, or simply accompanied a group and handed out folders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Over 70,000 folders were handed out in one hour by this method; many interesting remarks were overheard by those in the parade, some against and many for the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. This was a real thrill for all who participated in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the evening the sound cars, carrying large signs, joined in the parade; and before the day was over, everybody downtown had “Separating the Nations” called to his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sound-car campaign was one of the most interesting features of the field activity. The Lord’s protection and blessing was very evident. The city has an anti-noise ordinance, and recently a special effort has been made to enforce it. Repeated attempts had been made to secure a permit to use the sound cars, but without avail, and just before the convention it seemed certain that the sound work would be carried on with much difficulty, because in the week previous two operators had been arrested and the police appeared to be tightening down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, the workers went ahead, trusting in Jehovah for protection, and the results were beyond their greatest hopes. Fifty-seven interruptions were made by the police, but only two arrests were made, one resulting in a suspended sentence, and the other will be tried later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sound campaign was well organized in advance, and when the visiting cars came a guide familiar with the city was furnished from the New York company. These kept in constant touch with a central headquarters; the whole campaign was directed from one place. It was the greatest sound-car demonstration ever carried on in the city. The estimated number who heard the announcement of “Separating the Nations” and the rebroadcast through the sound cars exceeds half a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Repeated convention announcements for a total of 167 hours were given on New York’s most famous avenues and centers, such as Times Square, Wall Street, 42d Street, Seventh Avenue, Broadway, docks of ocean liners, Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue, Riverside Drive, Radio City, Harlem, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, etc. Practically the entire island of Manhattan was covered. Many interesting and thrilling experiences were reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Phonographs, 63 in all, were in use a total of 135 hours, with an attendance of 2,130. Phonograph operators were assigned to work in the field with witnessing parties. The general plan was to have all the party of 10 or 12 publishers work in one block, and in 20 or 30 minutes the names of the interested ones found were turned over to the phonograph men for back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Field witnessing arrangements worked very smoothly. Previous to the convention, territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">assignments were made to local workers who acted as territory guides or captains. These were fully instructed as to the procedure, and when the witnesses assembled for service Saturday morning and Sunday morning, all that was necessary was for the visitors to join a group headed by a guide and go right to the territory. This system worked splendidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a whole, the entire convention went off smoothly and efficiently. There was real unity and co-operation, and it seems that all came with one end in view: to have a part in the service and to do as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was observed that everyone present was busy with some feature of the work, including ushering, cafeteria, hospital, checkrooms, room assignments, information, book-supply room, phonograph room and telephone service, and the net result was a wonderful witness for Jehovah and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the conclusion of Judge Rutherford’s evening talk all were bubbling over with joy and enthusiasm; many expiessions of appreciation were heard for the extension of the Los Angeles convention. All hope that this new method of assembly will be repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following are some of the interesting reports from sound-car operators and guides in the field:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Announcement from sound car aroused a police captain from his sleep. Sends police car to find “noise”. Police car locates sound car and asks to see permit. Operators stall off police car until the P-Special record is finished. Captain becomes impatient. Sends out a second police car to find first police car. Second car arrives when lecture is finished. Sound car taken to police headquarters for questioning. Lieutenant in charge seemed to be favorable himself, but had to take action on account of orders from the captain. Requested no further activity in his precinct, but advised the operators that it was only a few blocks up the street to the next precinct, where they could continue if they wished. He accepted 92 folders to pass out to all the policemen in his charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unintentionally, on Sunday, one sound car made a setup about three quarters of a block away from a Catholic church. A few minutes after starting the lecture the priest with five men came out of the church and advanced toward the car. The priest asked to see the driver’s license. The sound guide spoke up, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Mister, </span><span class="font7">what authority do you have to demand to see a permit 1” The priest seemed stumped at this unexpected comeback. He and his aides were told to get off the running board, and then the car drove off, toward the church. As the priest had evidently stopped mass to try to stop the sound car, his congregation had followed him out of the church to see what was going on. The priest, unable to keep up, saw the sound car drive right up in front of his church making an announcement to his congregation to be sure to hear this important lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sound car having made arrangements to rebroadcast the lecture “Separating the Nations” in a parking lot was stopped about five nfinutes after starting. Through some misunderstanding another sound car a few minutes later came to the same parking lot, made a setup and was able to rebroadcast for 40 minutes without police interference. It is estimated that 5,000 heard the lecture from this one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many other interesting reports were given, including items as follows: Rocks and ice thrown at the cars, mean policemen, disfiguring signs on sound cars and tearing them down, friendly and inquisitive policemen stopping sound cars to ask for information concerning the lecture, using sound cars near churches when the congregation was leaving. (“St. John the Divine” on Riverside Drive was one of these.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One incident of interest was the reporting by an opposer to the police of the activities of a sixteen-year-old publisher. After some conversation the officer became friendly, and refused to lay any charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indeed, it was a season of refreshing for the Lord’s people, and all went their way happy and with a determination to remain loyal to Jehovah and His organization, and to meet the enemy squarely with the blessed assurance that soon the enemy organization will go down in shame and utter destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The opinion of the witnesses as a whole was that the division of an international convention into assemblies at several points is a great step forward, making the benefits of the convention available to a great many more of the Lord’s people, and on every hand the desire was expressed that there might be more such opportunities ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Hail Jehovah and His Son Christ Jesus. Greatest convention arrangement ever conceived.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">AITING, in Boston, Mass., around two-thirty, Sunday afternoon, February 23, 1936, to hear Judge Rutherford speak in Los Angeles, in about thirty minutes. Somebody in Los Angeles called the time (over the telephone line) every five seconds, so that the watches would tick harmoniously all over the world. He said, in carefully measured tones, “eleventwenty-nine and five seconds, eleven-twenty-nine and ten seconds, eleven-twenty-nine and fifteen seconds,” and so on around the dial. It would soon be three o’clock in Boston; that would be noon in Los Angeles; and then the address would begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">London was listening for the signals as intently as Boston, so that when the clock dials there indicated 8: 00 p.m. they knew that the address would begin shortly, for it was then noon in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was the morning of the next day in Sydney, Australia, Monday morning, approaching 7:00 a.m. Jehovah’s people were up early and had had their breakfast. They listened intently to see if they could catch every word that Judge Rutherford said when it was Sunday noon in Los Angeles. As the words fell from his lips they caught them within a second, though the accents seemed to be nineteen hours on the way. How wonderful it all is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were fifteen drivers of sound cars lined up on the platform at one of the declaration meetings. They were enthusiastic advocates of the peculiar privileges which are theirs. When Judge Rutherford spoke in Los Angeles it was as though, at some place in the heavens, there was a vehicle with sound apparatus able to reach to the ends of the earth. Three of the sound cars, with splendid co-operation by the police, rebroadcast the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three sound cars were kept going for about two weeks before the convention. Friday and Saturday, February 21 and 22, ten pieces of sound apparatus were used in the vicinity of Boston to advertise the lecture that spelled death to the Hierarchy and life to the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Acoustics were perfect at Boston. Every word of both addresses from Los Angeles came through as plainly as if the speaker were in the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 200,000 fliers put out advertising the lecture; along with the sound cars and the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">personal calls by 787 workers they produced </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">sults. Besides the conventioners, there </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">about 800 present at the afternoon lecture, and some 400 of these stayed over for the later one. How happy they all looked! They acted as if they wanted to be with the other sheep, and to stay in the fold. No doubt many of them will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Boston the cafeteria service was excellent. The food was ample in variety, splendidly prepared, appetizing and inexpensive. Almost fifteen hundred people were served Sunday evening in two hours, with half that number at each of four previous meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new signs for flashing “RICHES—Inquire Within” and other announcements of Jehovah’s witnesses, attracted much attention; orders were placed for 30 on the spot, with more promised later. It is hoped to have one of these in nearly every witness’ home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following account of the Boston convention appeared in the Boston </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> (February 24) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Facing microphones on empty platforms, 1700 persons in three audiences in halls at the New England Conservatory of Music—part of an international audience of 3,750,000 Jehovah’s witnesses listening to a round-the-world broadcast—yesterday stood up and shouted “Aye!” when Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, speaking at Los Angeles, urged them to support a resolution in which they promised not “to salute any creature or thing” but to obey only the Biblical Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Declaring that 1500 Jehovah’s witnesses were still in Nazi prisons and concentration camps in Germany for refusing to “heil” Hitler, Judge Rutherford declared that laws compelling persons to salute the American flag in spite of their religious convictions were a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy concerning the last days of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He described the governments of Italy, Austria, Germany and Russia as “modern Philistines” which were driving true Christians back to worship in defiance of political bans and compared meetings of the witnesses in Germany to those of early Christians in the Roman catacombs. For the benefit of 800 Germans recently granted amnesty by Hitler and other German members listening in to a shortwave broadcast, he denied Nazi charges that the Bible students’ group was heretical or under “Jewish influence”, and urged all members to submit to death by human agencies rather than to give up their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The truth of God’s word always provoked His enemies,” he said. “The final tribulation is here. The separation of the nations now going on is a warning. The cruel Inquisition has been revived. ’ ’</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Convention in Great Britain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">[Readers will excuse the omission from this page, in this issue, of Judge Rutherford’s usual five-minute talk.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">ROM the standpoint of Jehovah’s people, the evening lecture by Judge Rutherford on “Feasts” (no doubt to appear ultimately in the Watch Tower Society’s publications) was the feast of the convention. It worked out that way in Britain, where ten auditoriums in Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Huddersfield, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southampton held the 4,162 workers that waited until 1: 00 a.m. to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Sketch,</span><span class="font7"> the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror,</span><span class="font7"> the Bournemouth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Echo,</span><span class="font7"> the Dublin </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Herald,</span><span class="font7"> the Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Chronicle,</span><span class="font7"> the Leeds </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury,</span><span class="font7"> the Birmingham </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Dispatch</span><span class="font7"> and the Bolton </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font7"> acknowledged that the event in the Shrine Auditorium constituted the “World’s Biggest Broadcast”, the first occasion when “One Man Will Preach to the Whole World”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Methods used for advertising the public lecture were much the same as those already described as so widely employed in the United States. There were some additional features: 2,756,000 folders were distributed; 9,692 window cards were placed; 362 lantern slides were used in movie houses; 210 phonograph records were used in the streets; 3,873 cards were carried in buses and other vehicles; 622 posters were variously used, on trucks, automobiles, wheelbarrows, etc., and five electric newspapers were employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The attendance at the public lecture, earlier in the day, was 40,157, in all the auditoriums employed for the purpose, and at the conclusion these took away with them 18,414 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty </span><span class="font7">booklets. Besides the ten auditoriums used for the lecture received at midnight, 44 other auditoriums were used at various centers throughout Great Britain, for the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The official report submitted to the president by the British branch says: “As far as the British field is concerned, the results are beyond anything we had dared to hope for. Undoubtedly Jehovah controlled the whole matter, and we gladly acknowledge that all the praise is due to Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From London the lecture was transmitted to Paris, Brussels, Berne, Zurich, Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm and Helsingfors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two of the British Press Notices</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses know better than to expect much attention of a favorable nature from the public press, but the following, which appeared in the British papers named, are not so bad:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">World’s Biggest Broadcast. How G.P.O. Are Linking Up Countries. Judge Rutherford’s Message From Los Angeles. A tall, broad-shouldered man, with a big bass voice that has just a trace of Scottish accent, will talk to the world from Los Angeles, California, tomorrow night. Judge Rutherford, the American “hot gospeller”, will be the speaker from eight to nine o ’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The G.P.O., who are co-operating in the broadcast, say that it will be the most extensive “hook-up” linking of countries on record. Herr Hitler has “banned” Judge Rutherford, but even he will not be able to stop the voice coming into Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford’s voice will travel 3,000 miles across the American continent, then another 4,000 miles over the Atlantic to Baldock, Herts, whence it will be transmitted by land line to the International Exchange at Faraday Building. From there it will be switched for at least 1,000 miles on trunk telephone lines to halls in 56 cities and towns in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From London the voice will be flung over to many Continental cities and to Sydney, Australia, and New Zealand. From California it goes to South Africa, Bombay, Newfoundland and other places. Masts in Canada and Capetown will amplify the voice.—The Bolton </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Biggest Broadcast? A G.P.O. official told me yesterday that next Sunday a week what is believed to be the most widespread broadcast in history will be attempted. The occasion will be a speech at Los Angeles by Judge Rutherford, the evangelist. This speech will be relayed to all parts of the United States and will also be carried across the American continent for transmission to Great Britain by radio telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford’s remarks, I understand, will not be transmitted by the B.B.C. They will be transmitted by the Post Office to a large number of halls in various parts of the country which have been specially engaged by the judge’s British followers. The speech will be passed on to the Continent of Europe via the International Telephone Exchange in London, and will be similarly relayed to a number of meetings in various Continental countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is one European country in which the speech will certainly not be heard. That is Albania, which has no telephone service, either external or internal.—The Leeds </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE report of the assemblies of the International Convention February 22, 23,1936, the divisions thereof held on the North American continent, nine cities throughout the United States, and Toronto, Canada, gives much cause for rejoicing, and there are certain outstanding facts which lay great emphasis on the unity to which the Lord has brought His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The witness accomplished by this convention, which was for two days at all points except Los Angeles, where a three-day convention was held, far exceeds anything else in the way of a testimony accomplished by an international convention. The distribution of literature, 121,530 pieces, based on the actual reports of the field publishers, has never been equaled in a like convention period. This was made possible and 9,758 publishers were enabled to participate in the service because the convention was held at these several points instead of bringing everybody into one city. The witness that w<sup>T</sup>as given by radio on that occasion was tremendous, but, in addition to the great numbers who heard “Separating the Nations” in their own homes, there was a grand total attendance at the public meeting of 27,852, which far exceeds the assemblies of former conventions, and 19,876 of Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good will remained to hear the message Judge Rutherford had especially for them when he spoke on “Feasts” Sunday evening. The 33,580 hours of field service indicates that the majority attending the convention were there to have part in the service in some way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As should have been the case, this convention has been a great impetus to the work with sound</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">equipment. The total number hearing the Kingdom message and the spot announcements by means of phonographs, transcription machines and sound cars during the convention exceeds 700,000, and the use of the sound equipment on this occasion has really been an eye opener to many of Jehovah’s people in demonstrating the effectiveness of this means of advertising special features in addition to its use in consistently carrying the Kingdom message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All of this is certainly an assurance to the Lord’s people and rejoices their hearts that they have had some share in this special testimony and have been the recipients of Jehovah’s gracious favors and blessings on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work which was done in the middle of a most severe winter by this convention at these ten cities, the rapt attention which every assembly gave to the Lord’s word as they heard it brought to them by a mechanical means, and the wholehearted and spontaneous response to and great appreciation of the message they received, demonstrate conclusively that “they see their teachers” and are pressing on in the service of the King and the Kingdom because they have the love of the truth, the love for Jehovah which the truth brings to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not necessary for this band of the Lord’s people to be united in one place on the map, because they are so closely united in the organization and service of the Most High, and the instruction which they received at these widely scattered points has proved just as valuable and just as much appreciated as though the various assemblies were able to see, as well as to hear, the speaker to whom they were listening.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Interesting Letters from Abroad</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE will be echoes of Judge Rutherford’s address in the correspondence for months to come, and some of them may be published later, as they come to hand, but many readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> will be interested in the following fragments, some written before and some after the broadcast:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">At.a</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ska. Juneau: “Almost all that had good radios here got KOL in Seattle very well; this is something unusual for this time of day. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alberta. Bellis : “ I was so glad to hear the message, and I am sure that everyone that heard will greatly rejoice and praise Jehovah for the great witness work that is done at His command.’’ Grande Prairie: “The Lord has His mighty men at the front, and will keep them. It was the greatest pleasure for me to hear, as I am so much alone, away up here in the Peace River country.” Lethbridge: “Judge Rutherford’s lecture perfect; shortwave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Argentina. Buenos Aires : ‘ ‘ Contract has been signed with the only shortwave broadcasting station obtainable, so we will have LS2 long wave and LRX short wave. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Atlantic Ocean. “400 miles off the mainland of Florida I heard every word, first the organ tones from CMBC in Havana, Cuba, then the introductory speech from GCP in England, then to WQP-WEA in New’ York. I also heard the point-to-point stations testing after the broadcast, among them Geneva, Switzerland, and Melbourne, Australia. The sermon surely gives one something to think about. I had some of the other crew on the ship listening to it. It surely must have cost quite a good deal to put on such a gigantic program.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brazil. Sao Paulo: “Clear, strong, and encouraging to us, was the beautiful message which Jehovah gave us on February 23 through His faithful witness Judge Rutherford. It was 5:00 p.m. here in Sao Paulo when he began to speak. We heard him by LRX of Buenos Aires.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">British Columbia. Victoria: “I listened to your wonderful address and must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.” Vancouver: “Excellent reception.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">British West Indies. Jamaica. Kingston: “For the first time the Kingston company of Jehovah’s witnesses had the pleasure of listening, in their hall, to Brother Rutherford, simultaneously with all people in various parts of the earth. The first lecture, ‘Separating the Nations,’ was received with great delight from EAQ, Madrid. It came in clear and very distinct. The second thrilling lecture w</span><span class="font6"><sup>r</sup>as received through another station. We had given wide announcements, and many reports are coming in stating very good receptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Canal Zone. Ancon: “On COCH we heard every word to the end. The speaker’s voice was unusually</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">strong, clear, bold, emphatic, determined, defying and full of righteous indignation, yet the terms and phrases of the language used were the most consoling and comforting to persons of good will I ever heard. I rose to my feet in solemn token of my 100-percent agreement with and adoption of the Resolution, and did not and could not sit until the prolonged cheer of the audience ceased. Truly Jehovah is laughing and those who are sitting in the heavens are holding Satan and his hosts in derision. ’ ’ Cristobal: “Excellent reception from COCH, Havana, Cuba.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Canary Islands. Telde: “I heard the last half only of Judge Rutherford’s lecture. It was on a new set, the property of my landlord. He was not familiar with its operation and we lost much time, but finally got EAQ all O.K.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Colombia. Barranquilla : “If I am not mistaken,-1 heard the discourse over station WEA and WQP of New York. I heard the manager of one of these stations call a station of Madrid, Spain, asking if they heard well all the transmission, to which the Madrid station replied affirmatively.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cuba. Caimanera: “I happened to tune in on COCH of Havana at three o’clock on Sunday afternoon, February 23, and was just in time to hear Judge Rutherford’s thrilling discourse on ‘Separating the Nations’, and deem it the best I ever heard.” Santiago: (1) “There were present 21 persons. We tuned in on station COCH; reception was strong, clear, and could not have been better. We all joined in the shout ‘Aye’.” (2) “We heard every word of it, clear and distinct as if face to face; all were greatly thrilled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Denmark. Copenhagen: “We had 74 strangers and 180 friends. Brother Rutherford was, I think, in better voice than last time. When, in the last third, he was slating the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, one could almost feel the Devil himself was trying to drown him; there was much noise, but the voice came through it all and I heard every word distinctly. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ethiopia. Addis Ababa: “His majesty instructs inform you that Ethiopian radio not equipped for world-wide broadcast. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt. Cairo: “At 10:00 p.m. Sunday, Egyptian time, the lecture was to start. At 9: 00 p.m. we made arrangements to hear the program. Immediately the voice was heard, ‘Hello Rio de Janeiro.’ ‘Hello Australia.’ ‘Hello Geneva.’ ‘Hello England.’ We were thrilled through and through to hear for a whole hour the preparations and connections, and to hear frequently the names of the Watch Tower and Judge Rutherford. At last at 10: 00 p.m. Egyptian time we heard the musical program and then the lecture as distinctly as though we were present in the auditorium.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">England. Barnet: “I was very interested in your talk to the peoples of the world, and I would like to make a more careful study of all you said. ’ ’ Liverpool: “It was a very enjoyable hour. We could do with more addresses like that. I wonder the British Broadcasting Company did not relay the same, as a great number of my friends were disappointed at missing your fine message. I have a number of your books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life, Creation,</span><span class="font6"> etc., which I obtained at my door. May God’s blessing attend you and yours, and may we be able to hear you over the air again soon.’’ London: (1) “I was much intrigued by your speech at Los Angeles yesterday ■which I picked up by radio from some unknown (to me) station. I should be interested to know what station it was, as I cannot imagine the church-controlled governments of any European state allowing the relay. I admire you, sir, for your stand for religious tolerance, and must congratulate you for having secured such a large audience as was evidenced by the chorus ‘Aye’ you evoked.” (2) An official of the British Post Office said: ‘ ‘ This is one of the greatest broadcasts we have ever arranged. The cost in this country alone will probably be several thousands of pounds. It will be carried out almost entirely by the Post Office telephone service.” Preston: “We (father, wife and self) heard your -wonderful speech on Sunday evening 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., Greenwich time. I was tuning the dial of our radio, intending to tune into a religious service from the ‘National’ station, when I heard a clear voice speak of Jehovah’s witnesses, and warning the peoples of earth where they stand, and I shall be obliged for a copy of the lecture. The message was inspiring and gives hope. Wish you every success in your good work, which the Lord will surely see accomplished in spite of man’s opposition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">France. Chaumont: “Though 250 kilometers from Paris, the message came in quite clear, a smashing blow to the rotten Romish religion. That the Lord will clear away this lying, murderous crowd who parade as His representatives is our earnest desire. In this country the people seem to be divided into two distinct classes: ‘les croyants,’ those who say they believe in God, and the ‘ je m’en foutistes’, those who say God does not exist. Out of these two classes we sometimes find those who are reasonable and are willing to listen to the message of the establishment of God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Greece. Athens: “I have the honor to inform you that I heard through my Atwater-Kent the speech of Judge Rutherford on ‘Separating the Nations’, last Sunday, February 23, at 10:00 p.m., Athens time.” PiRzEus: “By the Lord’s grace we heard all of your lecture most distinctly. Your thundering voice encouraged and filled the hearts of the brethren with joy. We all joined with your visible audience saying before the Lord, ‘Aye.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guatemala. Quirigua: “Judge Rutherford’s lecture of February 23 was joyfully received at 2:00 p.m. With the exception of two slight disturbances we heard every word quite clear and distinct. All joined in adopting the resolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hawaiian Islands. Honolulu: “All but one of the 50 persons attending in the hall left their names for copies of the lecture, and, in fact, upon invitation, all expressed their intention of attending study meetings at Kingdom Hall. All attending joined in enthusiastically voting ‘Aye’ to the resolution presented. It was the greatest radio witness yet here in Hawaii.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ireland. Belfast: (1) “I heard with very keen interest Judge Rutherford’s address on ‘Separating the Nations’ which was transmitted around the universe last Sunday evening. I would, sirs, very much appreciate your sending me a copy of this address in order that I may give Judge Rutherford’s views closer study, as I am entirely in sympathy with his ideas in almost every respect concerning this vital matter.” (2) “It was with very great interest I listened to Judge Rutherford’s address over the radio last evening, and would be obliged if you would send me a copy, with all of which I thoroughly agree. I might say I stood up and said ‘Aye’ at the end of the resolution. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Japan. Tokyo: “The general chief of police said: ‘Japanese Government prohibited the importation of any book or booklets of Mr. Rutherford by order, and how could I give permission to rebroadcast his speech ? Certainly no. ’ ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mexico. Monterey: (Translation) “I am vitally interested in the important subject of the lecture which was broadcast today by radio from 2 to 3 p.m. by Judge Rutherford, from the municipal auditoriums of Los Angeles, Calif.” Mexico City: “Border stations fine to end; here stopped half. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">New Brunswick. Frederickton: “The lecture by Judge Rutherford came in very clearly from stations WPQ and WEA, New York. We were very much pleased and feel sure that the glad message of God’s kingdom has reached to the ends of the earth. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nova Scotia. Greenwich: “Our radio has not been working very well of late. It was with great delight, therefore, that upon tuning station EAQ, Spain, ■we heard your voice coming in as clearly and with as little distortion as if we were listening to a broadcast from our neighboring town. Reception from EAQ at that hour of the day was never as good, and that in a week of generally poor reception. Truly ‘this was Jehovah’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes’.” Wilmot: “Just a line to let you know we got Judge Rutherford’s lecture on ‘Separating the Nations’ by shortwave from Spain. Reception was perfect; the air was just full of it. And it was much appreciated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ontario. Hamilton: “My son and wife told me they picked up Judge Rutherford by shortwave, clear, every word distinct, from Madrid, Spain, EAQ.” North Bay: “We received the judge’s lecture fine over EAQ, Spain.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Palestine. Jerusalem: “Part of the lecture was heard by Pioneer George Ritter, from a station in France. The latter part of the message was drowned out by an electric apparatus of a doctor who lives in the same house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quebec. Verdun : “The lecture came through wonderfully, each word clear and distinct. The volume could not have been better; it sounded as if Judge Rutherford spoke from the platform. The loudspeakers on the roof did a fine job, being heard many blocks away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rumania. Bucharest: “Your broadcast received 95 percent. I just missed the finishing up of what appeared to be a splendid meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spain. Cadiz : ‘ ‘ Radio folders were distributed among British people in Gibraltar this morning. This evening we heard, from Radio Normandie, France, Judge Rutherford speaking clearly and straight from the heart, from 8:00 until 9:00 p.m. on ‘Dividing the Nations’. Praise to Jehovah and His King Christ Jesus.” Madrid: “We have just had the thrill and wonderful privilege of hearing Judge Rutherford’s world-wide broadcast. How clear and powerful the message came through, and how fearless was the exposure of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy! Doubtless you will receive many messages and letters about this broadcast, but as this is the first time we have heard Judge Rutherford in person over the wireless we must let you know that here in Zaragoza [Saragossa, Spain] the great broadcast brought joy and encouragement to the hearts of the Lord’s people, both English and Spanish; for although the Spanish brethren listening did not un</span><span class="font6">derstand the talk, yet they caught most of the thrill of the world witness being given. Just after the recent elections in Spain, in which Gil Robles and his Fascist cohorts were defeated, there were one or two events here in Zaragoza which the press, of the region at least, was careful to conceal. Two days after election day, at a manifestation of workers demanding the release of political prisoners, the police, still under the orders of the Fascist party, in order to disperse the crowd, fired upon them, causing one or two deaths and injury. That night we were kept awake by the firing of machine-guns, rifles and pistols. Later we learned that the Fascists had attempted to rouse the people to revolt, so that they, the Fascists, could then step in and establish a dictatorship, but without success, and that many of the shots had actually been fired from the convents. ’ ’ Madrid : “At the studio of the radio station EAQ Madrid we heard the whole discourse as it came in from America, through earphones. We heard every word distinctly; the reception was very good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Switzerland. Berne: “Supplementing cablegram [published in last issue] we also received word from Mr. Dunning, the secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce at Berlin, that he understood the lecture perfectly. A company of 50 were gathered at Brussels, and another company of 50 at Paris. The English pioneers in France, Belgium and Holland also were gathered in various places and listened to the lecture. The friends throughout Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, France and Alsace-Lorraine sent word that many heard the lecture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Union of South Africa. Cape Town : The postmaster general of South Africa, H. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J.</span><span class="font6"> Lenton, flatly refused all facilities for the reception and transmission of the message of God’s kingdom from 10: 00 to 11: 00 p.m. on the night of February 23, 1936, on the ground that the discussion of the Kingdom for which Jesus taught His followers to pray is not a matter of national importance.</span></p>

I notice Roosevelt immediately came back at this speech (although he beat around the bush, we can all see whom he was referring to) and said that all creeds should band together to fight the anti-religionists.

Judge Rutherford was speaking at that moment against the Catholic Hierarchy; so guess it must have come too near for comfort. We switched to station KGFX at Pierre, S.

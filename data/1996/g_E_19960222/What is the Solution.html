<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THERE is a growing belief that mankind’s well-being, and perhaps even our survival as a species, will depend on our ability to detect emerging diseases. . . . Where would we be today if HIV were to become an airborne pathogen? And what is there to say that a comparable infection might not do so in the future?” said D. A. Henderson—who played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox—to a group of scientists in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1993.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How might emerging diseases be detected? An early warning system for tropical disease epidemics is a global network of 35 laboratories that report to the World Health Organization (WHO). Yet, a survey of these laboratories showed that fewer than half of them were equipped to identify Japanese <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>encephalitis, hantaviruses, and Rift Valley fever—all deadly diseases. Only 56 percent could spot yellow fever, a mosquito-borne virus that causes vomiting, liver failure, and internal bleeding. In 1992 at least 28 people died in Kenya of yellow fever before doctors discovered the cause. For six months they thought they were fighting malaria.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another weakness of surveillance programs is that they cannot recognize the emergence of slow-acting viral diseases. HIV, for example, can hide inside a person, spread to others, and then manifest itself as AIDS up to ten years later. The present AIDS pandemic emerged almost simultaneously on three continents and quickly invaded 20 different nations. Clearly, there was no early warning for that!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Despite the problems, many scientists still look to the future with confidence, speaking optimistically of major discoveries and breakthroughs that will surely come in the years ahead. The <em>International Herald Tribune </em>reports: “The best hope for true breakthroughs, many scientists say, is biotechnology, the manipulation of hereditary material in living cells. Scientists at biotech firms hope to create cells that produce germ-killing substances, that is, a new generation of genetically engineered antibiotics.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">There is, however, a dark side to this. Genetic engineering has made it possible to insert genes into a harmless virus so that the virus can deliver the genes to people. This technology can be used beneficially, perhaps actually making possible the production of so-called genetically engineered antibiotics. But this technology may also be used for sinister purposes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For example, possibly genes from Ebola could be inserted by accident or design into a virus, such as influenza or measles. Then that deadly virus might be spread by a cough or a sneeze. Dr. Karl Johnson, who has spent a lifetime investigating viruses such as Machupo and Ebola, said that the time may soon come when “any crackpot with a few thousand dollars’ worth of equipment and a college biology education under his belt could manufacture bugs that would make Ebola look like a walk around the park.” Other biologists share his concern.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Solving the problems of infectious disease is not simply a matter of developing new drugs. It involves solving the disease-related problems of poverty, war, refugees, abuse of drugs, overcrowding of cities, unhealthy life-styles, pollution, and destruction of the environment. Be honest with yourself. Do you think humans are likely to solve these complex problems?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">God’s Word cautions: “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs.” In whom, then, should we trust? The scripture continues: “Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God, the Maker of heaven and earth.” Only Jehovah, mankind’s Creator, can solve the dilemmas that face humankind.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah’s inspired Word, the Bible, in recording Jesus’ great prophecy concerning “the sign . . . of the conclusion of the system of things,” foretold the medical miseries that afflict our generation. Jesus said: “There will be . . . in one place after another <em>pestilences.”</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 21:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">However, the Bible also points to a future time on earth under the rule of God’s Kingdom when “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Those who trust in Jehovah thus have strong reason to believe that obedient mankind will soon receive a permanent release from not only the deadly diseases that plague humans but also the problems that contribute to disease. True Christians appreciate the efforts of the medical community in the difficult battle against deadly microbes. Yet, they know the lasting solution to disease and death rests with God, the one “who is healing all your maladies.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:1-19:103:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 103:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 22:1, 2</a>.</p>

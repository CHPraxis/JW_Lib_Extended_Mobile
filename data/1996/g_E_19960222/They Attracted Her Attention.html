<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In May 1995 a woman in New York City wrote to the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York. She explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I was walking down East 124th St., between First and Second Avenues. I happened to look down, and the wind was blowing some tracts. I stooped and picked up three of your tracts, <em>Comfort for the Depressed, Enjoy Family Life, </em>and <em>Who Really Rules the World? </em>I read through them and enjoyed them very much.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I would appreciate it if you would be so kind and send me some information on the free home Bible study course. Also, if it is possible, I would like to receive some of your literature. As for me, it was a blessing that the good Lord put the three tracts in front of my path for me to find. The Lord does work in mysterious ways.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you would like to read these attention-arousing tracts or to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

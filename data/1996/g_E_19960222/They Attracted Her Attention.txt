They Attracted Her Attention
In May 1995 a woman in New York City wrote to the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York. She explained:
“I was walking down East 124th St., between First and Second Avenues. I happened to look down, and the wind was blowing some tracts. I stooped and picked up three of your tracts, Comfort for the Depressed, Enjoy Family Life, and Who Really Rules the World? I read through them and enjoyed them very much.
“I would appreciate it if you would be so kind and send me some information on the free home Bible study course. Also, if it is possible, I would like to receive some of your literature. As for me, it was a blessing that the good Lord put the three tracts in front of my path for me to find. The Lord does work in mysterious ways.”
If you would like to read these attention-arousing tracts or to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

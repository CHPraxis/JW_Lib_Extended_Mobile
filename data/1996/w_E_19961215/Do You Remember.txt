Do You Remember?
Have you enjoyed reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? If so, you will find it interesting to recall the following:
□ What is the meaning of the Greek word pa·rou·si’a used at Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39?
Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words says: “PAROUSIA . . . denotes both an arrival and a consequent presence with.” Hence, it is not just the moment of arrival but a presence extending from the arrival onward.—8/15, page 11.
□ How were ‘those days cut short’ so that “flesh” could be saved in the first century, and how will it occur on a larger scale? (Matthew 24:22)
In 66 C.E., the Romans unexpectedly cut short their siege on Jerusalem, allowing Christian “flesh” to escape. Similarly, we expect that the coming attack on Babylon the Great will somehow be cut short. Thus anointed Christians and their companions will be saved from possible destruction.—8/15, pages 18-20.
□ What should be our reaction if a person begins to partake of the Memorial emblems or ceases to do so?
There is no need for other Christians to be concerned. Jesus said: “I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep.” Just as assuredly, Jehovah knows those whom he really has chosen as spiritual sons. (John 10:14; Romans 8:16, 17)—8/15, page 31.
□ What was the main purpose of the Mosaic Law?
Primarily, it taught the Israelites of their need for the Messiah, who would redeem them from their sinful state. (Galatians 3:24) The Law also taught godly fear and obedience, and it helped Israel to keep separate from the corrupt practices of the surrounding nations. (Leviticus 18:24, 25)—9/1, page 9.
□ What is the purpose of the new covenant? (Jeremiah 31:31-34)
It is to produce a nation of kings and priests to bless all mankind. (Exodus 19:6; 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 5:10)—9/1, pages 14, 15.
□ Why should we practice the art of apologizing?
An apology can help to ease the pain caused by imperfection, and it can heal strained relationships. Each apology we make is a lesson in humility and trains us to become more sensitive to the feelings of others.—9/15, page 24.
□ Is the global Deluge of Noah’s day a historical fact?
Yes. Ancient accounts telling of a global flood can be found all around the world, from the Americas to Australia. The widespread presence of this theme adds support to the fact that a worldwide deluge did occur, as reported in the Bible. (Genesis 7:11-20)—9/15, page 25.
□ What is involved in being hospitable? (Romans 12:13)
“Hospitality” is translated from a Greek word that is made up of two root words meaning “love” and “stranger.” Hence, hospitality essentially means “love of strangers.” But it involves more than love based on principle, shown out of a sense of duty. It is based on genuine fondness, affection, and friendship.—10/1, page 9.
□ What is Paul’s argument regarding marriage and singleness in his first letter to the Corinthians, chapter 7?
Marriage is legitimate and, under certain circumstances, advisable for some. Yet singleness is undeniably advantageous for the Christian man or woman who wants to serve Jehovah with minimum distraction.—10/15, page 13.
□ How does an elder “provide for those who are his own”? (1 Timothy 5:8)
An elder should ‘provide for his own’—his wife as well as his children—materially, spiritually, and emotionally.—10/15, page 22.
□ How does Jehovah supply comfort to his servants?
God’s holy spirit acts as a “comforter.” (John 14:16, footnote) Another way in which God provides comfort is through the Bible. (Romans 15:4) God knows our individual needs and can use us to be of comfort to one another, as Paul gained comfort through Titus’ report about the Corinthians. (2 Corinthians 7:11-13)—11/1, pages 10, 12.
□ What is implied by Paul’s description of Jehovah as “the Father of tender mercies,” found at 2 Corinthians 1:3?
The Greek noun translated “tender mercies” comes from a word used to express sorrow at the suffering of another. Thus Paul describes God’s tender feelings for all of His faithful servants who are suffering tribulation.—11/1, page 13.
□ What was accomplished by the Israelites’ fasting on the annual Day of Atonement? (Leviticus 16:29-31; 23:27)
The observance of fasting moved the people of Israel to greater consciousness of their sinfulness and the need for redemption. By it they expressed sorrow for their sins and repentance before God.—11/15, page 5.
□ What is implied in the injunction to young people: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator”? (Ecclesiastes 12:1)
One authority says that the Hebrew word translated “remember” often implies “the affection of the mind and the action which accompanies recollection.” So heeding this injunction means more than just thinking about Jehovah. It involves action, doing what pleases him.—12/1, page 16.

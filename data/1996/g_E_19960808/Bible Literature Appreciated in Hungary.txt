Bible Literature Appreciated in Hungary
A teacher in Balmazújváros wrote to the Watch Tower branch office in Hungary: “I have seen a book that attracted my attention. If possible, please send me a copy. The title is My Book of Bible Stories.” After becoming acquainted with this book, a school principal in Budapest requested: “We would like to order 20 copies of My Book of Bible Stories for Elementary School No. 6.”
A person from Balatonboglár who had read the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work wrote: “The book was thought provoking, and the Bible-based answers provided therein are accurate. The book helped me very much, and I found answers to the questions I had. I would like to strengthen my faith even more. Therefore, if possible, please send me publications about the Bible.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are pleased to provide assistance to those who desire to grow in Bible knowledge. If you would like to receive a copy of either one of the books mentioned above or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

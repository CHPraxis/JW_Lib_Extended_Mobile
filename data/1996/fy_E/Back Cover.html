The frightening spread in teenage drug abuse and immorality, the modern plague of divorce and family violence, the explosive growth in the number of single-parent families, and other serious problems make some wonder whether family life will survive.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Is it still possible for a family to be a stable, nurturing environment for its members? Yes, if family members know the real secret of family happiness. This secret is not hidden. It has been tried and tested over many, many centuries. What is it? This book, <em>The Secret of Family Happiness, </em>gives the answer. It also gives practical examples of how this “secret” can help resolve a number of challenging family situations. Is there anyone today who does not need such information?</p>

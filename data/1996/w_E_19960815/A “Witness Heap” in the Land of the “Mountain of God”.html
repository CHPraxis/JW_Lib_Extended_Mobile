<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ON A map of the continent, if you follow the coastline of West Africa and move east along the Gulf of Guinea, at the point where the coast turns south, you will find Cameroon. If you continue south down the coast, you will come to a vast stretch of black sandy beaches. The black sand is the result of volcanic activities of Mount Cameroon.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This conical, 13,353-foot <strong>[4,070 m] </strong>mountain peak completely dominates the area. When the setting sun bathes the slopes of Mount Cameroon in light, it gives a spectacular show of vivid colors—mauve, orange, gold, and crimson. The sea and nearby swamps reflect all these tints like a mirror, making it almost impossible to separate the sky from the earth. It is easy to understand why the animist tribes of the region named the mountain <em>Mongo Ma Loba, </em>which is translated “Chariot of the gods,” or more commonly, “Mountain of God.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Farther south, there are miles of white sandy beaches, lined with coconut trees. Apart from the idyllic coastline, much of the country is covered with dense equatorial forest, stretching to the border with Congo and Central African Republic and north to Nigeria and sub-Saharan Chad. The western part of the country is mountainous, reminding the traveler of parts of Europe. The hot climate, however, will not let you forget that you are just a stone’s throw from the equator. The diversity of its countryside leads many tourist guides to describe Cameroon as a replica of Africa in miniature. This impression is reinforced by the different ethnic groups and the more than 220 registered languages and dialects.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Were you to visit Cameroon, you might stay in one of the big hotels in the seaport of Douala, or the capital city, Yaoundé. But you could miss out on the opportunity of getting to know something about the lives of the people, especially of the more than 24,000 Witnesses of Jehovah, who have been busy building up a “witness heap” throughout this land of the “Mountain of God.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Why not take a trip across the country to meet some of them? Your exploration of this West African land will certainly be richly rewarded.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>By Dugout Canoe, Bush Taxi, or Bicycle?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Where the Sanaga, the longest river in Cameroon, reaches the ocean, it forms a large delta. To reach all the inhabitants of this vast region, Jehovah’s Witnesses often have to travel in dugout canoes. This is what the nine Kingdom publishers in the small group at Mbiako do. Two of them live 16 miles <strong>[25 km] </strong>away, in the village of Yoyo. For them to reach Mbiako requires vigorous paddling, yet they are always present at the Christian meetings. While visiting this <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>group, a traveling overseer suggested showing the video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name. </em>But that is easier said than done. In such a remote village, where would he find a videocassette recorder, a television set, and the electricity to run them?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">During the week of the visit, some publishers called on the pastor of a local church. To their surprise the pastor warmly welcomed them, and they had a spirited Bible discussion with him. Noticing that the pastor owned not only a VCR but also an electric generator, the brothers plucked up the courage to ask if they could borrow his equipment. Having enjoyed the Bible discussion earlier, the pastor agreed to help. Saturday evening 102 persons came to the showing, including the pastor and most of the members of his church. The two Witnesses from Yoyo brought a number of interested ones in two canoes. They thought little of having to paddle against the current of the rising tide. After seeing the video, they were deeply moved and encouraged, and they were proud to belong to such a great organization whose aim is to honor Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To go where dugout canoes cannot reach, one can use the bush taxi. The parking areas where these taxis wait for passengers are always buzzing with life. Between the cold-water vendors, banana sellers, and bus boys, it is easy to become totally confused. The bus boys’ job is to get passengers into the waiting bush taxis, which are all, according to them, “ready to go.” However, “ready” should be taken only in the loosest sense of the word. Travelers have to spend hours, sometimes even days, waiting. Once all the passengers have been crammed inside and the driver has stowed the luggage, bags of produce, and sometimes even live chickens and goats, on the roof rack, the bush taxi moves onto the bumpy, dusty tracks.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">One traveling minister, tired of this form of transport, opted for independence. He now makes all his trips by bicycle. He says: “Ever since I decided to use a bicycle to travel from congregation to congregation, I always arrive on time for the visit. True, the trip may take several hours, but at least I do not have to spend a day or two waiting for the bush taxis. During the rainy season, some roads almost completely disappear because of flooding. You have to take your shoes off <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>to cross these stretches of mud and water. One day one of my shoes fell into a stream and was not recovered until several weeks later, when the daughter of one of the Witnesses caught it quite by accident while fishing! I am happy to be able to wear this pair of shoes again, after one of them spent some time with the fish. At times I go through areas where Jehovah’s Witnesses have never preached before. The villagers always ask me what I’ve got. So I keep magazines and brochures handy. Each time I stop, I offer these Bible-based publications and give a brief witness. I believe Jehovah will make these seeds of truth grow.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Deep in the Interior</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to share the Kingdom good news with others even deep in the heart of Cameroon, in the villages hidden in the depths of the forest. This requires a great deal of effort, but the results are heartwarming.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Marie, a full-time minister, started a Bible study with a young girl called Arlette. At the end of the first study, Marie asked Arlette if she would accompany her to the door, as it is the custom in this part of Africa. However, the young girl explained that she could hardly walk because of pain in her feet. Arlette’s feet were infected by a type of flea of which the female burrows into the flesh, causing abscesses. Marie bravely removed the fleas one by one. Later, she also learned that at night this young girl was being tormented by demons. Marie patiently explained how to place one’s trust in Jehovah, notably by calling upon his name out loud in prayer.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Arlette made rapid progress. At first her family saw nothing wrong with the study because of the remarkable progress she was making both physically and intellectually. But when they realized that she wanted to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, they forbade her to continue the study. Three weeks later Arlette’s mother, realizing how distressed her daughter was, contacted Marie and asked her to resume the study.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When the time came to attend a circuit assembly, Marie paid a driver to take Arlette on both days. The driver, however, refused to go up to Arlette’s home, having decided that the track leading to the road was impassable. So Marie managed to bring the girl to the road. Jehovah certainly blessed these efforts. <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>Today Arlette attends all congregation meetings. To help her do this, Marie tirelessly comes to fetch her. Together they make the 75-minute walk each way. Since the Sunday meeting starts at 8:30 a.m., Marie has to leave home at 6:30; yet they manage to arrive on time. Arlette hopes to symbolize her dedication by water baptism shortly. Marie states: “Anyone who did not see her when she started to study cannot imagine how much she has changed. I thank Jehovah very much for the way he has blessed her.” Marie is certainly a fine example of self-sacrificing love.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Far Up North</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Northern Cameroon is full of contrasts and surprises. During the rainy season, it is transformed into a huge, lush garden. But when the scorching sun takes over, the grass withers away. At noon, when the sun is at its zenith and shade is hard to find, sheep will squeeze themselves against the red-mud walls of houses. Amid the sand and dry grass, the only vestiges of greenery are the few leaves of the baobab trees. Even though these are not as large as their cousins in the equatorial forest, they are just as hardy. Their ability to endure the harsh environment well illustrates the zeal and courage of the few Witnesses who have gone to live in this region in order to let the light of truth shine.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Some of the congregations in this area are separated by 300 to 500 miles <strong>[500-800 km]</strong>, and the feeling of isolation is very real. But there is a great deal of interest. Witnesses from other areas move here to help. To be effective in the ministry, they have to learn Foufouldé, a local dialect.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A Witness from Garoua decided to spend a few days preaching in his native village, about 100 miles <strong>[160 km] </strong>away. He found some interest, but the high cost of transport prevented him from returning regularly. A few weeks later, the Witness received a letter from one of the interested persons begging him to come and visit again. Still lacking the money for the fare, he was not able to go. Imagine how surprised the Witness was when the person showed up at his home in Garoua to inform him that ten people in the village were waiting for his visit!</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In another village, near the border with Chad, a group of 50 interested people have organized their own Bible study. They arranged for three of their number to attend meetings in the nearest congregation in Chad. On returning, these would then conduct the Bible study with the whole group. Indeed, Jesus’ words can well apply here: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:37-40:9:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>Witnessing in the Cities</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">After many years of shortage, about two years ago, the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em><span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>magazines became freely available in Cameroon. There is much enthusiasm for and interest in these magazines as many people are reading them for the first time. A young special pioneer couple assigned to one of the cities placed 86 magazines on their first morning preaching in their new territory. Some publishers place up to 250 magazines in a single month! What is the secret of their success? Offer magazines to everyone.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">A Witness working in an office open to the public always leaves magazines out on display. One woman looked at the magazines but did not take any. The Witness discerned her interest and offered her a copy, which she accepted. He was surprised to see her come back the following day. She not only wanted to contribute for the magazine she had taken but also asked for more. Why? Having been a victim of rape, she had chosen the magazine on that subject. She had spent the whole night reading and rereading the advice given. Feeling much relieved, she wanted to know more about Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Even small children can share in spreading the Bible’s message of hope. When a six-year-old Witness girl was asked by her teacher to sing a Catholic hymn, she refused, stating that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The teacher then asked her to sing one of her own religion’s songs so that he could grade her on it. She chose the song entitled “God’s Promise of Paradise” and sang it from memory. The teacher questioned her, saying: “You mention a paradise in your song. Where is this paradise?” The girl explained God’s purpose to establish Paradise on earth very soon. Surprised by her answer, he asked her parents for the book she was studying. He was willing to grade her on this rather than on what she was being taught during the lessons on religion. The parents suggested to the teacher that if he wanted to grade her correctly, he should first study himself. A Bible study was started with him.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Planning a Visit?</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In many parts of the world today, people are indifferent to the Kingdom good news. Neither God nor the Bible interests them. Others are paralyzed by fear and simply refuse to respond to any stranger at the door. All of this is a real challenge to Jehovah’s Witnesses in their ministry. But what a difference in Cameroon!</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Preaching from door to door is a delight here. Instead of knocking, it is customary to call out, <em>“Kong, kong, kong.” </em>Then from inside a voice replies, “Who is it?” after which we introduce ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses. Usually, the parents ask their children to fetch benches and place them in the shade of a tree, perhaps a mango tree. A pleasant time is then spent explaining what God’s Kingdom is and what it will do to relieve mankind’s woeful condition.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Following just such a discussion, a lady poured out her heart, saying: “I am distressed to see that the truth I have been searching for is not to be found in the religion I was born into and in which I have grown old. I thank God that he has shown me the truth. I was a deacon in my church. The statue of the Virgin Mary spends one week in the home of each deacon so that each can make requests to her. As for me, I always asked Mary to help me to know the truth. Now God has shown me that the truth is not with her. I thank Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">So if some day you feel the need to experience the intense joy that can be had in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom, why not visit this part of West Africa? Besides discovering “Africa in miniature,” whether by canoe, bush taxi, or bicycle, you will also be contributing to the “witness heap” that is being built up in the land of the “Mountain of God.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p>
<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p31" data-pid="31">“Witness Heap” is the probable meaning of the Hebrew word translated “Gilead.” Since 1943, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has been sending out missionaries to open up the preaching work worldwide, including in Cameroon.</p></div>

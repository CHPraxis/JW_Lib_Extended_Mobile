Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
□ Do Jesus’ words, “If you forgive the sins of any persons, they stand forgiven,” mean that Christians can forgive sins? (John 20:23)
There is no Scriptural basis for concluding that Christians in general, or even appointed elders in the congregation, have divine authority to forgive sins. The context of Jesus’ words seems to show that the apostles had provided to them through an operation of the spirit a unique authority to forgive or retain sins. (See Acts 5:1-11; 2 Corinthians 12:12.)—4/15, page 28.
□ What is outstanding about J. J. Stewart Perowne’s translation of the book of Psalms, first published in 1864?
In his translation Perowne tried to adhere “closely to the form of the Hebrew, both in its idiom and in the structure of the clauses.” In doing so he favored the restoration of the divine name in the form “Jehovah.”—4/15, page 31.
□ What guidance did Jesus give his followers as to their dealings with the governments of the world?
Jesus said: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (Matthew 22:21) He also said: “If someone under authority impresses you into service for a mile, go with him two miles.” (Matthew 5:41) Jesus was here illustrating the principle of willing submission to legitimate demands, whether in human relations or in governmental requirements that are in harmony with God’s law. (Luke 6:27-31; John 17:14, 15)—5/1, page 12.
□ What does it mean to ‘walk in the truth’? (Psalm 86:11)
This includes abiding by God’s requirements and serving him in faithfulness and sincerity. (Psalm 25:4, 5; John 4:23, 24)—5/15, page 18.
□ What was accomplished by Jehovah’s sending Jonah to Nineveh?
As things worked out, Jonah’s preaching activity in Nineveh showed up the contrast between the repentant Ninevites and the stiff-necked Israelites, who were sorely lacking in faith and humility. (Compare Deuteronomy 9:6, 13; Jonah 3:4-10.)—5/15, page 28.
□ Who is the Serpent and who is “the woman” referred to at Genesis 3:15?
The Serpent is not the lowly snake but the one who used it, Satan the Devil. (Revelation 12:9) “The woman” is not Eve but Jehovah’s heavenly organization, the mother of his spirit-anointed servants on earth. (Galatians 4:26)—6/1, page 9.
□ How can a person get out of Babylon the Great and find safety? (Revelation 18:4)
He must completely separate himself from false religious organizations and also from their customs and the spirit they engender, and then he should find safety within Jehovah’s theocratic organization. (Ephesians 5:7-11)—6/1, page 18.
□ Why is the eagle frequently mentioned in the Scriptures?
Bible writers alluded to characteristics of the eagle to symbolize such things as wisdom, divine protection, and swiftness.—6/15, page 8.
□ Do God’s servants today who have the earthly hope have as much of God’s spirit as do spirit-anointed Christians?
Fundamentally, the answer is yes. God’s spirit is available in equal portions to both classes, and knowledge and understanding are equally attainable by both.—6/15, page 31.
□ Why is it beneficial for us today to examine the sacred service performed by Israel’s priests in the temple in Jerusalem?
By doing so we can come to appreciate more fully the merciful arrangement whereby sinful humans today become reconciled with God. (Hebrews 10:1-7)—7/1, page 8.
□ How did the second temple built in Jerusalem attain a greater glory than the one built by Solomon?
The second temple lasted 164 years longer than Solomon’s temple. More worshipers from many more lands flocked into its courtyards. More important, this second temple enjoyed the great distinction of having the Son of God, Jesus Christ, teach within its courtyards.—7/1, pages 12, 13.
□ When did God bring forth his spiritual temple?
This was in 29 C.E. when God showed his approval of Jesus’ baptismal prayer. (Matthew 3:16, 17) God’s approval of the presentation of Jesus’ body meant that, in a spiritual sense, an altar greater than that in Jerusalem’s temple had come into operation.—7/1, pages 14, 15.
□ Why should we be forgiving?
Forgiving an offender who has apologized is essential if we are to maintain Christian unity. Animosity and nursing a grudge will rob us of peace of mind. If we are unforgiving, we run the risk that some day Jehovah will no longer forgive our sins. (Matthew 6:14, 15)—7/15, page 18.
□ How could the Israelites become holy?
Holiness was possible only by their having a close relationship with Jehovah, the holy God, and by their pure worship of him. They needed accurate knowledge of “the Most Holy One” in order to worship him in holiness, in physical and spiritual cleanness. (Proverbs 2:1-6; 9:10)—8/1, page 11.

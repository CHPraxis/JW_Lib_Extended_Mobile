<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you ever feel that way? Many people today do. A woman from Fort Smith, Arkansas, wrote to the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, and explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Your book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>is very informative and inspirational. I read it from cover to cover in just a couple of days. It gives me hope that soon the promised new world under the rule of Jesus Christ will be here. I long for that day.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Until then, I am faced with surviving in this world, waiting for that to happen. I get very discouraged with this mundane, boring, uneventful life. I need encouragement and hope. You stated that through your organization we can have a free home Bible study if we are interested. Could you please let me know what it takes to get this? I think this home Bible study would help encourage me.”</p>

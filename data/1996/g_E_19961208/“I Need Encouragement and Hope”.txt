“I Need Encouragement and Hope”
Do you ever feel that way? Many people today do. A woman from Fort Smith, Arkansas, wrote to the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, and explained:
“Your book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life is very informative and inspirational. I read it from cover to cover in just a couple of days. It gives me hope that soon the promised new world under the rule of Jesus Christ will be here. I long for that day.
“Until then, I am faced with surviving in this world, waiting for that to happen. I get very discouraged with this mundane, boring, uneventful life. I need encouragement and hope. You stated that through your organization we can have a free home Bible study if we are interested. Could you please let me know what it takes to get this? I think this home Bible study would help encourage me.”
If you would like to receive a copy of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life or would like to have someone conduct a home Bible study with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the address nearest you listed on page 5.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus Christ was the greatest teacher who ever lived on earth. He spoke in a way that touched people’s hearts, stirred their emotions, and motivated them to practice good works. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:28-40:7:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 7:28, 29</a>) He always used God’s Word as the basis for his teaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 24:44, 45</a>) He gave Jehovah God the credit for all that he knew and was able to teach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 7:16</a>) Jesus set a splendid example for his followers by handling God’s Word aright.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The apostle Paul also served as an outstanding example by effectively handling the Word of God. He did more than just read the Scriptures to others; he explained and reasoned on what he read, presenting proof from God’s Word that Jesus was the Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:2-44:17:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 17:2-4</a>) Likewise, the eloquent disciple Apollos was “well versed in the Scriptures,” and he handled them aright in making a powerful presentation of the truth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:24-44:18:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 18:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:28-44:18:28" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Be a Teacher of God’s Word: </strong>Modern-day Kingdom proclaimers have enjoyed excellent success in teaching honesthearted people by referring to and reasoning from the Bible. In one case, a brother was able to use <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a> along with related texts to reason with a pastor and three of his parishioners on the destiny of the wicked and the righteous. As a result, some members of the church began to study, and one of them eventually accepted the truth. In another case, a sister was asked to explain to the opposed husband of an interested person why Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas and birthdays. As she read the Scriptural answers directly from the <em>Reasoning </em>book, the man expressed his agreement. His wife was so delighted at his acceptance that she said: “We will be coming to your meetings.” And the husband agreed!</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>When we handle the Word of God aright, we will find that it “is alive and exerts power . . . and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart” of those to whom we preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) The success we enjoy with it will move us to speak the truth with ever greater boldness!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 4:31</a>.</p>

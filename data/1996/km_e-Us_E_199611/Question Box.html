<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>What should we keep in mind when writing letters to householders whom we have been unable to find at home?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For a variety of reasons, we are finding it increasingly difficult to contact people when we visit their homes. Some publishers have found letter writing to be a practical way to reach them. While this can produce some good results, there is a need to consider some reminders that can help us to avoid some difficulties:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do not use the Society’s return address. This would improperly indicate that the correspondence was sent from our offices, causing unnecessary problems and sometimes extra expense.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Make sure you have the correct address and sufficient postage.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do not address letters to “Occupant”; use a specific name.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Do not leave letters in the door when no one is at home.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Brief letters are best. Enclose a tract or a magazine rather than attempt to write out a lengthy message.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Typewritten letters are much easier to read and create a more favorable impression.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Letters are not counted as return visits unless you have personally witnessed to the individual previously.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If you are writing to a person who formerly showed interest, you should provide an address or phone number so that you can be contacted. Explain our Bible study program.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Extend an invitation to the meetings of the local congregation. Give the address and meeting times.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Do not continue to send letters to not-at-homes after turning in the territory; the publisher who currently holds the territory is responsible for working it.</p>

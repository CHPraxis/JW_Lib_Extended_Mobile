<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus’ words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a> are to be taken seriously. He meant what he said—taking in knowledge of God and Christ means everlasting life! But is it just by our possessing knowledge of Jehovah and Jesus that we will be rewarded with life eternal? No. The Israelites knew that Jehovah was their God, but their life course did not reflect that belief. As a result, they lost his favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:1-28:4:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hos. 4:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:6-28:4:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Today millions of people may “have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:2-45:10:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 10:2</a>) They need to come to know Jehovah, “the only true God,” and to learn how to serve him properly. To that end, during November we will be offering the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>What approach will you use in presenting the <em>Knowledge </em>book? Here are some suggestions that may help you.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>Since the idea of living forever on earth is new for most people, this introduction might capture their interest:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“We are asking our neighbors a question. If you were invited to live forever in a world like this, would you accept the invitation? [Show the picture on <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995011/1-5">pages 4-5 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book. Allow for response.] This can really become your happy lot in life. But what do you think you would have to do to see it become a reality for you? [Allow for response.] Notice what action is required according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>. [Read.] This book is helping many to acquire this special kind of knowledge. Would you like to have a personal copy to read? [Allow for response.] On my next visit, we can discuss why it is reasonable to believe that we can attain to everlasting life right here on earth.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When you return to visit those with whom you discussed </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong><em>John 17:3</em></strong></a><strong><em>, you might proceed in this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“During my last visit, I read to you Jesus’ fascinating words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, where he assured us that taking in knowledge of God and of him means everlasting life. But many people believe that a better life can be achieved only in heaven. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] If the book that I left with you is handy, I would like to show you some Bible verses that prove Paradise is to be restored on earth. [Discuss <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995012/16-21">paragraphs 11-16 on pages 9-10 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book.] On my next visit, I would like to show you why you can trust these promises that are found in the Bible. In the meantime, perhaps you could read chapter 2 in your copy of the book.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Here is a presentation that you may wish to use with people who are religiously inclined:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“We have been talking to our neighbors regarding why there are so many different religions in the world. Some 1,200 religious denominations exist in the United States alone, and over 10,000 in the entire world. Yet, there is only one Bible. In your opinion, why does this confusion of religions exist? [Allow for response. Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995016/3-3"><em>Knowledge </em>book to chapter 5, and read paragraph 1</a>.] You will receive satisfying answers to those questions by reading this chapter. I will be happy to leave the book with you if you care to examine it.” If it is accepted, make definite arrangements to return, and say: “When I come back, perhaps we could discuss whether all religions are simply different roads leading to the same place.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>When you return to continue the discussion about why there are so many religions, you could say this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“When I last spoke with you, I raised the question of whether all religions are merely different roads leading to the same place. What do you think about that? [Allow for response.] I would like to show you in the book I left with you what Jesus said on the matter. [Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995016/">chapter 5 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book, and read paragraphs 6-7, including <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21-23</a>.] You may wonder why it is so important to know exactly what the will of God is. You will find that the next paragraphs are very informative. Please read the remainder of this chapter. Next time I come, I will be pleased to show you the value of having accurate Bible knowledge.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>A direct approach is often successful in starting Bible studies. Here is a suggested introduction that appears on </em></strong><a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/26:137-36:131"><strong><em>page 12 in the “Reasoning”</em></strong></a> <strong><em>book:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I’m calling to offer you a free home Bible course. If I may, I’d like to take just a few minutes to demonstrate how people in some 200 lands discuss the Bible at home as family groups. We can use any of these topics as a basis for discussion. [Show the table of contents in the <em>Knowledge </em>book.] Which one especially interests you?” Wait for the person to make a selection. Turn to the chapter that is chosen, and start the study in the first paragraph.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>Here is another successful direct approach that you could try for starting studies:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I give Bible lessons free of charge and have openings in my schedule for additional students. This Bible study aid is what we use. [Show the <em>Knowledge </em>book.] The course lasts only a few months and provides answers to such questions as: Why does God permit suffering? Why do we grow old and die? What happens to our dead loved ones? And how can we draw close to God?” Then ask, “May I demonstrate the study to you?” If the offer of a study is declined, ask if the person would like to have the <em>Knowledge </em>book to read on his own. If he promises to read it, leave a copy.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What a treasure the accurate knowledge of God and Christ is for everyone that possesses it! Taking it in truly means everlasting life in perfect conditions. Let us use every opportunity during November to share with others the knowledge that leads to everlasting life.</p>

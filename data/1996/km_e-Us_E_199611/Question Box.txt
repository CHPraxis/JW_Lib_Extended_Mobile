Question Box
▪ What should we keep in mind when writing letters to householders whom we have been unable to find at home?
For a variety of reasons, we are finding it increasingly difficult to contact people when we visit their homes. Some publishers have found letter writing to be a practical way to reach them. While this can produce some good results, there is a need to consider some reminders that can help us to avoid some difficulties:
Do not use the Society’s return address. This would improperly indicate that the correspondence was sent from our offices, causing unnecessary problems and sometimes extra expense.
Make sure you have the correct address and sufficient postage.
Do not address letters to “Occupant”; use a specific name.
Do not leave letters in the door when no one is at home.
Brief letters are best. Enclose a tract or a magazine rather than attempt to write out a lengthy message.
Typewritten letters are much easier to read and create a more favorable impression.
Letters are not counted as return visits unless you have personally witnessed to the individual previously.
If you are writing to a person who formerly showed interest, you should provide an address or phone number so that you can be contacted. Explain our Bible study program.
Extend an invitation to the meetings of the local congregation. Give the address and meeting times.
Do not continue to send letters to not-at-homes after turning in the territory; the publisher who currently holds the territory is responsible for working it.

Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer <em>Survival Into a New Earth. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations that still have a supply of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 34 may encourage publishers to offer these in the same manner that other tracts are used, whether from door to door or elsewhere. If permissible, publishers may leave one at each not-at-home, making sure it is placed completely out of sight of passersby. Effort should be made to distribute all remaining copies of this valuable message.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting the <em>1997 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>with their November literature request. The <em>Yearbook </em>will be available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the <em>Yearbook </em>is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. <em>Yearbooks </em>are special-request items.</p>

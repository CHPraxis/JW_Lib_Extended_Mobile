Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to follow up on all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies. December: New World Translation with the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1984 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer Survival Into a New Earth. February: Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!
▪ Congregations that still have a supply of Kingdom News No. 34 may encourage publishers to offer these in the same manner that other tracts are used, whether from door to door or elsewhere. If permissible, publishers may leave one at each not-at-home, making sure it is placed completely out of sight of passersby. Effort should be made to distribute all remaining copies of this valuable message.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1997 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their November literature request. The Yearbook will be available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the Yearbook is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Yearbooks are special-request items.

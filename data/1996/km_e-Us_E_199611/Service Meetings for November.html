<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Conducting Progressive Bible Studies. Talk by the service overseer. We have been using the <em>Knowledge </em>book in the Bible study work for over a year. Likely some students have already finished it, while others are well along in the book. We were encouraged to concentrate on conducting studies designed to help new ones learn the truth quickly, apply it in their lives, and become part of the congregation. The June 1996 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert provided fine suggestions to help us to be effective as teachers. Briefly review some of the things we can do to teach students skillfully, as covered in paragraphs 3-13 of that insert. Next, concentrate on what needs to be done to help them take a positive stand, as outlined in paragraphs 14-22. Read paragraphs 15, 17, 20-1. Review some positive reports showing how good results have been achieved by local publishers. Encourage more to share in the Bible study work.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">â–ª <strong>What should be done when an assigned public speaker fails to arrive in time for the meeting?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Occasionally, unavoidable circumstances will prevent a brother from arriving in time to give his scheduled talk. If there is reason to believe that he will arrive shortly, the elders may decide to go ahead with the <em>Watchtower </em>Study; the Public Meeting could follow afterward. What if it becomes apparent that the speaker will not arrive? Perhaps one of the local speakers could give any talk he has already prepared.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Careful advance planning usually prevents this problem. The public talk coordinator should contact each speaker at least a week in advance to remind him of his assignment. The reminder should include the time of the meeting, the Kingdom Hall address and phone number, and clear directions on how to locate the hall. The speaker must make careful note of these details. He should take the assignment seriously, making any needed adjustments in his personal affairs so that he can fulfill this responsibility. If something unavoidable comes up that will prevent him from doing so, he should contact the public talk coordinator immediately so that a substitute can be arranged. Every effort ought to be made to avoid last-minute cancellations. If the speaker is delayed and will be a few minutes late, he can see to it that a phone call is made to the Kingdom Hall so that the brothers will know how to proceed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Appreciation for public talk assignments, good advance planning and reminders, and careful oversight can ensure that the congregation will be able to enjoy a beneficial public talk every week.</p>

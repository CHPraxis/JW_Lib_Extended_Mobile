<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Review Literature Offer for September. We will use the book <em>Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>Illustrate the versatility of this publication. Chapters 1-15 thoroughly research the controversy over how life got here; chapter 16 addresses a universally perplexing question, “Why Would God Permit Suffering?”; chapters 17-18 build faith in the Bible as being God’s trustworthy, inspired Word; chapters 19-20 highlight the Kingdom good news about life on earth in Paradise and explain how to attain it. Have a capable publisher use one of these approaches to demonstrate a brief presentation of the <em>Creation </em>book. If the congregation still has in stock copies of <em>Making Your Family Life Happy </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, </em>these may be offered.</p>

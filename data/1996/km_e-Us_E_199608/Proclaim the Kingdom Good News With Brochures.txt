Proclaim the Kingdom Good News With Brochures
1 What a joy it is to know the truth and to be among those who are zealously proclaiming the good news! People who are outside God’s organization desperately need to hear the Kingdom good news. The truth about the Kingdom is explained with simplicity in the brochures Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” and The Government That Will Bring Paradise. They vividly portray life on earth under God’s Kingdom, and they direct the reader to the Kingdom realities that are explained in God’s Word. Of course, placing a brochure with an interested person is only the start of our work. (1 Cor. 9:23) Let us promptly follow up all placements, with the objective of offering a study in the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. How can we accomplish this during August?
2 The brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” may be offered with a very brief presentation. As you display its cover, you might say:
▪ “I would like to show you something that contains a beautiful message.” Open the Life on Earth brochure, and read the first paragraph of the introduction. Then continue: “It also answers this question [turn to the heading above picture number 8]: ‘Why does man die?’ You will find it interesting to study the pictures and read the scriptures that are in this brochure. If you want to do that, you may keep this copy.” If the brochure is accepted, then add: “This is a worldwide volunteer work that is supported by small donations. If you care to make a donation, I will be pleased to accept it.”
3 What will you say when making a return visit on a placement of the “Life on Earth” brochure? You could try this approach:
▪ Show picture number 49 in the Life on Earth brochure and ask, “Isn’t this a beautiful picture? [Allow for response.] It is in the brochure that I left with you last visit. I would like to ask you the question on the next page.” Turn to picture number 50 and read the question: “‘Do you want to live forever in that beautiful paradise?’ [Allow for response.] If that is your wish, notice what it says you should do: ‘Then learn more about what God says.’ [Read John 17:3.] I would be happy to study the Bible with you free of charge. Would you like that?” Make a definite appointment to return.
4 When offering the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” you might start by displaying the entire cover picture and asking:
▪ “What do you think it would take to make the whole earth look like this?” Allow for response. Describe some of the features of the picture, which are related on page 3. Then say: “Most people feel it is impossible to make a world like this. But it is not impossible for God to accomplish. [Share points in paragraph 43; then read Isaiah 9:6, 7.] God has promised to bring about a new world in which people from all nations will enjoy a wonderful paradise. I’d like you to read this brochure. It will show how you and your family can enjoy a marvelous future of God’s making.”
5 On the return visit, you could use the “Look!” brochure to explain why there is a need to learn more about the Bible. Perhaps show the cover again and say:
▪ “When I first showed you this picture, we agreed that we would love to live in such a wonderful world. To make this possible, there is something all of us need to do.” Open the “Look!” brochure to paragraph 52; read the paragraph and the scripture at John 17:3. Relate the information to the illustration in paragraph 53 about a proper Bible education, and then explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses offer such instruction free of charge in the home. Offer to demonstrate our study method, using the Knowledge book.
6 When offering the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,” you might try saying this:
▪ “I’ve heard many people say they would like to live under a government that can really solve the big problems we face today. [Mention local problems such as unemployment, rising crime, or drug abuse.] These things make us feel very insecure about the future for ourselves and our loved ones. Do you think there will ever be a government that will solve these problems? [Allow for response.] Perhaps you have prayed the Lord’s Prayer. If so, did you know that you are actually praying for a righteous government?” Turn to page 3 in the Government brochure, and read the first two paragraphs. Offer the brochure.
7 If the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise” was placed, you could begin the discussion on the return visit by saying:
▪ “Previously we discussed the need for a righteous government that can solve man’s problems. The brochure that I left with you points to God’s Kingdom as our only hope. Some people wonder what that government could do to improve our lot in life. The Bible shows that Christ has already proved he will succeed where human leaders have failed.” Open the Government brochure to page 29, and read the last four paragraphs. Then say: “Is that not a wonderful future? Would you like to see it?” Allow for response. Read John 17:3. Encourage learning more through a home Bible study.
8 If you are using other brochures, you can prepare your own presentations, using those suggested above as models. When appropriate, explain briefly that interested people may make small donations to the worldwide Kingdom-preaching work. Prepare well and seek Jehovah’s blessing as you proclaim the Kingdom good news.

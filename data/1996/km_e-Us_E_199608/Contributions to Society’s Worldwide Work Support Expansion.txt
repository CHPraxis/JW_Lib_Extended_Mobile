Contributions to Society’s Worldwide Work Support Expansion
As foretold at Isaiah 54:2, 3, Jehovah’s pure worship continues to expand throughout the earth. This includes various lands on the African continent and nearby islands. During the past ten years, restrictions on Kingdom activity have been lifted in such places as Angola, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, and Togo. In these and other lands where the field has been white for harvesting, Gilead missionaries, graduates of the Ministerial Training School, Bethel family members, and others have taken up assignments.—Matt. 9:37, 38.
Obviously, the increase of true worshipers in Jehovah’s organization calls for the construction of hundreds of new Kingdom Halls. It has also been necessary to plan for Assembly Halls and new or expanded branch facilities. Financing these projects as well as keeping the Kingdom work moving forward not only in Africa but also in other parts of the world has drawn heavily on the contributions to the Society’s worldwide work.
The pictures and drawings on two pages of this insert give you some idea of what the Society has been endeavoring to accomplish in the African field. What is shown is some of the construction that is now under way and projects that will begin soon.
By checking the field service chart in the 1996 Yearbook, you can get a better picture of what the publishers in these countries are doing in the ministry. Outstanding increases have taken place in many lands, and the potential for growth is reflected in the exceptional Memorial attendances. When we keep in mind what is being accomplished as part of the global Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work on other continents, it impresses on us what a privilege we have to support in a material way the cause of true worship.—Luke 16:9; 1 Tim. 6:18.

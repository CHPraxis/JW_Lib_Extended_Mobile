Containing Report for the Service Year of 1995
“Become doers of the word.”
This inspired counsel, recorded at James 1:22, is our yeartext for 1996. It is a reminder for all of us, as well as for those we teach, that hearing the truth is only a start. To please Jehovah, we must do the things he commands.

Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Hungary
Since the start of their activity in Hungary over 95 years ago, Jehovah’s Witnesses have endured harsh persecution at the hands of clergy and rulers alike. Though banned in 1939 and arrested in large numbers in the 1950’s, they did not stop preaching the good news. Now legally recognized, they continue their ministry with more zeal than ever before.
Mozambique

Now a new era in the advancement of true worship has opened up on the east coast of Africa, in Mozambique.
Venezuela

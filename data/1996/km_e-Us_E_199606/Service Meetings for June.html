<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Messengers of Godly Peace” District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</p>

Explain that the new format for the back page of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>is designed to help us to be better prepared to follow up initial calls. Since it is often wise to make the return visit within a day or two, instead of waiting longer, we will consider suggested presentations for both the house-to-house call and the return visit on the same Service Meeting. Briefly review paragraphs 2 and 3, followed by a demonstration of each. The initial presentation should include brief comments on how a donation can be made to the worldwide work. The remaining presentations in the article will be covered on the next two Service Meetings.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"> <strong>8 min: </strong>Training Children in Field Service. A talk by an elder. From an early age, our children should be active with us in service. The training and experience they acquire will provide a strong basis for their faith and zeal in later years. It is important that they appreciate the need to take the ministry seriously and conduct themselves properly. Children must avoid rowdy conduct; service is not a time for playing. It is best for them to work with adults. They should be helped to share in giving presentations according to their abilities. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1988563/26-26">August 1, 1988, <em>Watchtower, </em>page 15, paragraph 20</a>.) Parents are responsible to provide oversight; they should not send children to meetings for service without an older person to supervise them. Commend children when they do well.</p>

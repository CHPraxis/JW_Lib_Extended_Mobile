<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>How should the listing for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear in a local telephone directory?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It has been noted that there is great variety in the way that listings for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear in telephone directories around the country. Some are rather confusing, and others do not provide sufficient information. If the congregation has a telephone in the Kingdom Hall, it is important to have an informative listing in the telephone book, making it possible for interested ones and our brothers to make contact with the local congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The following is the recommended listing: Jehovah’s Witnesses, (City), (State), followed by the Kingdom Hall address and phone number.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In cities having more than one congregation, we recommend the following: Jehovah’s Witnesses, (City), (State), followed by an alphabetic listing giving the name, Kingdom Hall address, and phone number of the congregations.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It can be determined locally whether to provide an alternate phone number. If you share a Kingdom Hall with another congregation located in a different city that is not covered by the local telephone book, the name of that city should also be shown along with the Kingdom Hall address and phone number.</p>

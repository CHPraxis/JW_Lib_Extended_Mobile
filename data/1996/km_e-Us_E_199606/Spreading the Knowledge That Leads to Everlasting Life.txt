Spreading the Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life
1 Jehovah is “the One teaching men knowledge.” (Ps. 94:10) He uses us to spread lifesaving knowledge about him to those who are unaware of how to serve him acceptably. The book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life is a fine teaching instrument through which honesthearted ones can gain an accurate understanding of God from his written Word, the Bible. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) The Knowledge book’s clear and logical development of the truth will help people to grasp what Jehovah is seeking to teach them. This month we want to engage people in conversations that will cause them to want to read the book. Here are some suggestions. Rather than attempt to memorize these, try to express the key thoughts in your own words and natural manner of conversing.
2 Since most people have lost a loved one in death, you could work the resurrection hope into a conversation by first saying something like this:
▪ “Most of us have lost a loved one in death. Have you wondered whether you will see such a one again? [Allow for response.] Death was not part of God’s original purpose for man. Jesus proved that our loved ones can be rescued from death. [Read John 11:11, 25, 44.] Even though this took place centuries ago, it demonstrates what God has promised to do for us. [Open the Knowledge book to the picture on page 85 and read the caption. Then show the picture on page 86 and comment on it.] If you would like to read more about this comforting hope of the resurrection, I’d be pleased to leave this book with you.”
3 After the initial discussion about the resurrection hope, you could begin the next conversation with the same person in this way:
▪ “You may recall my saying that death was not part of God’s original purpose for man. If that’s true, why do we grow old and die? Some turtles live over 100 years, and there are trees that have been alive for thousands of years. Why do humans live only 70 or 80 years? [Allow for response.] We die because the first human pair disobeyed God.” Read Romans 5:12. Turn to page 53 in the Knowledge book and read the chapter title. Consider the first three paragraphs, pointing out the answers to the printed questions. Make an appointment to return later to discuss the rest of the chapter. Encourage the person to finish reading it in the meantime.
4 If you speak to a person who appears to be religious, you might say:
▪ “There are literally hundreds of different religions today. They teach all kinds of conflicting beliefs. Some people say that all religions are good and it makes no difference what we believe. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.] Jesus taught the true religion and showed that other forms of worship are unacceptable to God. [Read Matthew 7:21-23.] If we want to please God, we must worship him in harmony with his will.” Open the Knowledge book to chapter 5, read the title, and point out some of the subheadings. Explain that this information will help one learn how to please God. Offer to leave the book if there is a promise to read it, and mention that you do accept donations for our worldwide work.
5 People who are confused because there are so many religions might appreciate the answer to this question on your return visit:
▪ “With so many different religions in existence today, how can we tell which is the right one? What would you look for? [Allow for response.] Jesus told us how to identify his true followers.” Read John 13:35. Consider paragraphs 18 and 19 in chapter 5 of the Knowledge book. Point out that by using these Scriptural guidelines and the process of elimination, a person can recognize the true religion. Relate how Jehovah’s Witnesses are known the world over for their genuine love and high moral standards. Explain how a study of the Bible, using the Knowledge book, will clearly identify the form of worship that God approves.
6 If you meet a parent, this approach might be effective:
▪ “Every day, we hear reports about the unruly conduct of youths who seem to have no moral values whatsoever. Some adults want to blame the school system for not teaching children the difference between right and wrong. Who do you think should provide this training? [Allow for response.] Listen to what the Bible says on this question. [Read Ephesians 6:4.] That tells us that instilling moral values in children is the parents’ responsibility.” Open the Knowledge book to page 145, read paragraph 16, and comment on the pictures on page 147. Explain that the book is designed for the entire family to study. Using paragraphs 17 and 18 on page 146, offer to demonstrate how we conduct such a study with families.
7 If you started a study with a concerned parent on the initial call, you might continue it on the return visit by saying:
▪ “Today’s world places many temptations before our young ones. This makes it so difficult for them to become God-fearing as they grow up. Perhaps you remember that in our last discussion, we isolated two principles. As godly parents, we need to set fine examples for our children, and we should provide constant expressions of our love for them. There is another thing that the Bible says children need from their parents.” Read Proverbs 1:8. Turn to page 148 in the Knowledge book and continue the study, covering paragraphs 19-23. Suggest that you return again to study with the entire family, starting with chapter 1.

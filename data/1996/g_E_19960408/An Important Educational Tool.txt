An Important Educational Tool
A member of parliament in the country of Sri Lanka wrote to “The ‘Awake!’ Editor.” His letter is reproduced below:
“Dear Sir,
“It must be said that though the Awake! magazine you publish is a small one, it is extremely important and timely. Every single article helps the youth of today to differentiate clearly between good and bad.
“I have read all the articles. My impression is that every schoolteacher, student, and parent should definitely read this magazine.
“I deeply appreciate the fine work in which you are engaged. I wish you continued success in your endeavors.”
Nearly 16 million copies of each issue of Awake! are printed, in 78 languages. The magazine is recognized around the world as an important educational tool. You too will benefit from reading it. If you would like a copy or would like to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

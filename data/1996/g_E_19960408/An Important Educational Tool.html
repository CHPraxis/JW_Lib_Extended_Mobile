<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Sir,</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It must be said that though the <em>Awake! </em>magazine you publish is a small one, it is extremely important and timely. Every single article helps the youth of today to differentiate clearly between good and bad.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I have read all the articles. My impression is that every schoolteacher, student, and parent should definitely read this magazine.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I deeply appreciate the fine work in which you are engaged. I wish you continued success in your endeavors.”</p>

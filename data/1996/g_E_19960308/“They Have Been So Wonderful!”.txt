“They Have Been So Wonderful!”
“I have always enjoyed reading The Watchtower and Awake!, but in recent years they have been so wonderful that it is difficult to find the adjectives to describe them. I wanted to express my appreciation for the information presented in the October 22 and November 8, 1994, issues of Awake! under the titles “When Religion Takes Sides in War” and “Sarajevo—From 1914 to 1994.” The Bosnia-Serbia-Croatia civil war is a complex and tragic situation but one that is very close to my heart as a Croatian. I particularly appreciated the way you traced the history of the conflict and its deep roots back to 1054. This illuminated the role of religion and its relentless efforts that have led to more divisions and hatred among these national groups. Unfortunately, the world today can only see the worst in these inherently good people. Thank you again for making an incomprehensible situation understandable. [Signed] M. K.”
Awake! has established a reputation for careful research and objective reporting. But it is also a magazine that gives hope for a peaceful future based on God’s promise to bring the earth under his Kingdom rulership.

Something Young People Need Today
A 14-year-old New Jersey, U.S.A., girl said that earlier this year she had to write a report on “Why Students Cheat on Tests.” She brought her book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work to school to do research. One of her schoolmates picked it up and started to read the headings of the sections of the table of contents, such as “Sex and Morals” and “Dating, Love, and the Opposite Sex.”
“May I have this book?” the schoolmate asked.
“I explained that this was my copy,” the student said, “but that I would bring her one. When I did, another classmate saw the book and asked me to get one for her too. Shortly thereafter, I brought ten of the Young People Ask books for students who wanted a copy.”
The 14-year-old student feels that the book is valuable to have. She said: “We truly do need this publication because being a youth these days is very difficult.”
If you would like to have a copy of the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the value of Bible education with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the address nearest you listed on page 5.

Awake! Helped Save a Life
While one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ecuador was waiting for a mechanic to finish working on her car, the mechanic’s wife told the Witness that she was worried about her infant son, Byron. He would suffer convulsions five or six times a week, and doctors were unable to diagnose the problem. Byron had even been taken to specialists in Quito, the capital city.
“While conversing with the mother,” the Witness explained, “I noticed a worker painting a car, and I remembered an Awake! article on lead poisoning. The article mentioned that one of the symptoms of lead poisoning was convulsions. I told the woman that I would bring her the article.”
When Byron’s parents read the article, they had their son examined for lead poisoning. A high level of lead was found in Byron’s blood. Medical treatment and prevention of further exposure to lead resulted in remarkable improvement in Byron’s health. “The last four months he has not had one convulsion,” the Witness said. “The father has since talked to many doctors about the case, and he always gives credit to Awake! for having saved his son’s life. Now even some of these doctors are reading Awake!”

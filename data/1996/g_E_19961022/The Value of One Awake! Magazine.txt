The Value of One Awake! Magazine
In August 1993, a man in São Paulo, Brazil, found a copy of Awake! in the garbage. After reading it with appreciation, he sent a note to the Watch Tower Society’s address in Brazil. He wrote: “Please send me information about a free home Bible study. I’m certain that it will help me a lot.”
The man’s request was forwarded to a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses near where he lives. The man was visited, and a Bible study was started with him. In September 1995, the man symbolized his dedication to God by water baptism at a convention of the Witnesses.
The value of one Awake! magazine should not be underestimated. What it contains touches lives in a personal way. If you would like to receive this journal regularly, ask one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or write to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

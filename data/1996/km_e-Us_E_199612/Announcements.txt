Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: New World Translation with the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1984 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer Survival Into a New Earth. February: Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! March: The Secret of Family Happiness.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1996 with their December literature request. (See Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 6-8, 10.) The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The Memorial for 1998 will be on Saturday, April 11, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1998 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.
▪ Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother each year.
▪ New Audiocassettes Available:
Singing Kingdom Songs (single audiocassette) —English
▪ New Compact Discs Available:
Singing Kingdom Songs —English

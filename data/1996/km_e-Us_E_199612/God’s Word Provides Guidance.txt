God’s Word Provides Guidance
1 “We are living in a world with too many problems and far too few answers. Many millions regularly go hungry. Increasing numbers are addicted to drugs. More and more families are breaking up. Incest and family violence are constantly in the news. The air we breathe and the water we drink are slowly being poisoned. Meanwhile, more and more of us are victimized by crime.”
2 Thus begins the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? Its introduction is even more relevant today than when the book was published seven years ago. People need to know that God’s Word gives guidance and provides solutions to all the problems that plague them. We will endeavor to help people in December by offering them the New World Translation and the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? Of course, merely leaving literature with a person is no guarantee that he will accept God’s guidance. We must make return visits with the goal of starting a Bible study. Help is assured if we put forth such effort. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Here are some suggested presentations:
3 If you meet an older person, you might try this approach:
▪ “May I ask: When you were younger, how did people in the community treat one another? [Allow for response.] Things are a lot different now, aren’t they? What do you think is the reason for the change? [Allow for response.] We are actually seeing the fulfillment of a prophecy in the Bible. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5.] Besides accurately describing the world as it is today, the Bible promises a better world in the near future. For that reason we are encouraging everyone to read the Bible. Did you notice how clear the language is in this Bible, the New World Translation, that I was reading from?” Explain that it is written in modern English, making the Bible more understandable. Show the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?, and point out chapter 10, which explains another prophecy that we have seen fulfilled. Offer the Bible and the book. If offer is accepted, mention the donation arrangement that supports our worldwide work.
4 When you call back on an older person with whom you placed the Bible and the book, you could say:
▪ “When we last talked, we agreed that in many ways modern society has changed for the worse compared with what life was like just a few years ago. However, I came back to show you that the Bible sets out prospects for a much better world in the future. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] Knowing that this is God’s Word should encourage us to look into what else the Bible has to say.” Open the God’s Word book to chapter 14, and read paragraphs 3-4. Offer a free home Bible study.
5 If you engage a younger person in conversation, you could say:
▪ “I would like to ask you a question: As a young person, do you feel that you have reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead? How does the future look to you? [Allow for response.] Fortunately, there is real reason to be optimistic about the future. [Read Psalm 37:10, 11.] Since people have varying views of the Bible and its contents, we have published this book, The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? Notice the reasons it gives for reading the Bible. [Read paragraphs 16-17 on pages 10-11.] Once we are convinced that what the Bible says is true, we come to have a sure hope for the future. If you wish to read this book, I will be happy to leave a copy with you.”
6 When you return to see a younger person who accepted the “God’s Word” book, you might begin by stating:
▪ “I appreciated hearing how concerned you are about the future. Recall that I showed you a Bible text promising us a happy and secure future. Here is another one. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] The book I left with you gives convincing proof that the Bible is God’s Word, not man’s. That fact has some profound implications. Notice what they are. [Read paragraphs 1-2 on pages 184-5.] If you would like, I will be pleased to study the Bible with you free of charge.” If a study is accepted, ask if the individual has a copy of the Bible. If he does not, offer the New World Translation. Give the person an opportunity to make a donation.
7 A person who does not know where to turn for guidance to cope with life’s problems might respond to this approach:
▪ “We live at a time when almost everyone is faced with serious problems. Many turn to all sorts of counselors for guidance. Some look to psychics for help. Where do you think we can find sound counsel that will really work for us? [Allow for response.] The Bible states an important fact that all of us need to appreciate.” Read Jeremiah 10:23. Open The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? to page 187, and read paragraph 9. “This book will help you to appreciate how, under God’s Kingdom, all our problems will be eliminated. Would you like to read it?” If accepted, explain our donation arrangement.
8 If on the initial call you talked about man’s need for guidance, you could continue the discussion on the return visit by saying:
▪ “When we first met, we agreed that we need guidance from God if we are going to cope successfully with life’s problems. Regarding that, I think you will appreciate the concluding comments that are made in the book I left with you. [Read paragraphs 12-13 on page 189 in the God’s Word book.] I am pleased to offer you a free home Bible study course, and I am prepared to demonstrate it to you right now.”
9 Jehovah will bless our efforts as we help old and young alike to appreciate the value of God’s Word and its guidance in our life.—Ps. 119:105.

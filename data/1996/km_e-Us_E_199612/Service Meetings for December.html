There are ways we can show them consideration so as to include them in the service group: Offer to provide transportation; arrange for them to work homes where there are fewer stairs to climb; keep the car close by so that they can rest when they get tired; offer to take them on their return visits; let them know you will take them home when they feel they cannot continue. Older ones are thankful for the help that is offered to them. Mention other ways you show such consideration locally.

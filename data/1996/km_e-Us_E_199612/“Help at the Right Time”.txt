“Help at the Right Time”
1 How refreshing it is to receive help just when we need it! (Heb. 4:16) At the “Messengers of Godly Peace” District Convention, we rejoiced when we were given two special provisions of help at just the right time.
2 The new book, The Secret of Family Happiness, came at an appropriate time. It focuses on four essentials that promote a happy family life: (1) Self-control, (2) recognition of headship, (3) good communication, and (4) love. The admonition presented in the Family Happiness book will help all families who apply it to find godly peace. Set aside time to read the new book carefully and to study it together as a family. Get well acquainted with its features so that you will be prepared to use it effectively when it is offered to the public for the first time, in March.
3 The new brochure, What Does God Require of Us?, has come at the right time to help speed up our disciple-making work. While it may especially be used to help people with limited reading ability, many literate adults and young children will also benefit from its simple explanation of basic Bible teachings. It may be just what is needed to start a study as a stepping-stone to the Knowledge book. This provision is sure to help many more appreciate how they can be richly blessed by doing what God requires.
4 David expressed our sentiments perfectly when he declared that ‘he lacked nothing, his soul was refreshed, and his cup was well filled!’ (Ps. 23:1, 3, 5) We joyfully look forward to passing on this wonderful spiritual help to many others who sincerely desire to know and to serve the true God, Jehovah.

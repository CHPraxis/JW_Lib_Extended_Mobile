<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE May 1, 1996, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>contained an in-depth discussion of Christian neutrality and how to balance our responsibilities to Jehovah and to “Caesar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>) Many expressions of appreciation have been heard for the new information provided. Among them is the following letter, written by a Witness in Greece and addressed to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I want to express my deepest gratitude to all you dear brothers for taking such good care of us spiritually. Having spent some nine years in prison because of my Christian faith, I truly appreciate the wonderful thoughts in the May 1, 1996, issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>) This was a wonderful gift from Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“While I was enjoying these articles, I remembered a comment in an earlier <em>Watchtower </em>(August 1, 1994, page 14): ‘Clearly, reasonableness is a precious quality, one that moves us to love Jehovah all the more.’ Yes, brothers, I thank Jehovah that I am a part of his kind and loving organization, which clearly reflects his wisdom.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 3:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The increased light in the May 1 <em>Watchtower </em>has been well received here in Greece, especially by those who spent several years in prison or who are still in prison because of their faith. Thank you once again. May Jehovah strengthen you with his spirit to continue to provide us with valuable spiritual food in these troublesome times.”</p>

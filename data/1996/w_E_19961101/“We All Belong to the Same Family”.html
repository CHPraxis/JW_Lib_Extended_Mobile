<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN RECENT years religious prejudice and racism have spread around the earth. Ethnic differences have sparked killings, torture, and other shameful atrocities. According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights violations forced over 23 million people worldwide to flee from their homes in 1994.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Rwanda alone, some 500,000 people were slaughtered and more than 2,000,000 others became refugees after violence erupted between the Tutsi and the Hutu. “Jehovah’s Witnesses were especially persecuted,” reports the Belgian newspaper <em>Le Soir, </em>“for their refusal to carry arms.” Jehovah’s Witnesses do not engage in armed conflicts. Nevertheless, hundreds of them were killed in the violence. This reminds us of Jesus’ words to his disciples: “Because you are no part of the world, . . . the world hates you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One Witness family—Eugène Ntabana, his wife, and two children—lived in the capital, Kigali. When explaining Christian neutrality to his neighbors, Eugène often spoke of the bougainvillea, a climbing vine that thrives in warm climates.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Here in Kigali,” Eugène would explain, “the bougainvillea produces red, pink, and sometimes white flowers. Yet, they all belong to the same family. It is the same with humans. Although we may be of different races, skin color, or ethnic background, we all belong to the same family, the family of mankind.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Tragically, despite their peaceful nature and neutral stand, the Ntabana family was murdered by a bloodthirsty mob. Still, they died faithful. We can be sure that Jehovah God will fulfill his promise to such ones, and they will be resurrected to inherit a world where prejudice will be no more. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) Then, the Ntabana family, along with others, will “find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>.</p>

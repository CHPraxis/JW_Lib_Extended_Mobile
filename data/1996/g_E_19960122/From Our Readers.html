<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Tobacco Industry  </strong>The series “Killing Millions to Make Millions” (May 22, 1995) was informative and intelligent. The painting on the cover (“Skull With Cigarette”) by Vincent van Gogh was chilling! Perhaps this picture alone will be enough to make some people stop smoking or at least deter some from starting.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since I work for the American Cancer Society, I was particularly excited to read these articles. I sent a copy to the woman who chairs the local chapter of a tobacco-free coalition. She was impressed with the quality of writing and research and requested 35 copies for her colleagues.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">My husband and I had given up smoking for nearly three months, but I still had cravings for cigarettes. Then I read this article, and it made me realize that some of the ingredients in a cigarette are so toxic that it is illegal to dump them in a landfill! This strengthened me to hate what is bad.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Lupus Sufferer  </strong>Thank you so much for the information on lupus in the article “Now It Is Only Mia and Jehovah.” (February 22, 1995) I am 18 years old, and I have been suffering from this illness for about two years. It is encouraging to know how suffering is endured by other brothers and sisters in different parts of the world and to see how our Creator always lovingly supports us.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Problem Parents  </strong>I had prayed for an article like “Young People Ask . . . What If My Parent Falls Short?” (May 22, 1995) How sad and hurt I was when my mother was disfellowshipped from the Christian congregation! I almost quit pioneering, full-time evangelizing. The article strengthened me to ‘work out my own salvation with fear and trembling’ instead of worrying excessively about Mom’s standing with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:12-50:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 2:12</a>) Thank you so much.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I’m a baptized Christian, but I’ve found it very hard to honor my father who comes home drunk every day. While reading this article, I could not stop crying. Now that I’ve read it, my negative feelings and thinking toward my father have eased up considerably, and I feel more settled inside.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Christian Science  </strong>The article “Seminars to Improve Relations Between Doctors and Jehovah’s Witnesses” (March 22, 1995) carries a comment on the Christian Science approach to sickness. In the interest of building understanding between our faiths, I’d like to assure your readers that in relying on spiritual healing, Christian Scientists value and protect human life as we believe Christ Jesus showed us to do. A record of verified healings published in our periodicals for over a century illustrates that it is worship of God, not martyrdom, which is our motive. Spiritual, moral, and physical well-being are consistently the result.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Thank you for these comments. Our intent in quoting the words of a medical doctor was to highlight the fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses do accept medical treatment. While we respect the rights of others to believe as they wish, Jesus Christ actually said that “persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 9:12</em></a>) <em>And when Paul discussed Timothy’s “frequent cases of sickness,” he did not recommend spiritual healing but offered a common medical treatment. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>1 Timothy 5:23</em></a>) <em>The Bible’s view of medical treatment is thus in conflict with the teachings of Christian Science.—ED.</em></p>

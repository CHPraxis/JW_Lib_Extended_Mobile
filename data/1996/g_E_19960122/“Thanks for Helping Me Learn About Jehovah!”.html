<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That was the heartfelt expression of a 16-year-old girl from Florida, U.S.A. After reading publications published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, she wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I cannot recall the name of it, but I read a book about Jesus’ life that I believe you published. Before reading that book, I thought I knew all I needed to know. I believe in God and Jesus, I pray before supper and again at night, and I lead a pretty good life. But after reading that book, I realized that I don’t know very much at all and that I need to keep reading and learning about Jehovah God and Jesus and others in the Bible.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I’m slowly changing some of my ways so that I can be a better servant of God. If it weren’t for the Watch Tower Society, I would still be ignorant of God and the stories in the Bible. Thanks for helping me learn about Jehovah!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>is the title of the book the girl was referring to. In it an effort has been made to present every event in Jesus’ earthly life that is set forth in the four Gospels.

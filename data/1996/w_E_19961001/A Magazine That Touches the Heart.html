<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">COUNTLESS magazines are published around the globe to satisfy the reader’s hunger for information or entertainment.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What makes the magazine in your hand so exceptional? The following letter, which was received by the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Germany, may provide an answer:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Thank you very much, dear brothers, for your efforts and work. When my two sons and I returned from the meeting, although it was 9:30 p.m., I simply had to listen to the latest <em>Watchtower </em>[on audiocassette]. As I washed the dishes, I began listening to the first study article (April 1, 1995). I felt that I had to listen to it once more, so I interrupted my work in the kitchen and read the article [“You Are Precious in God’s Eyes!”] in <em>The Watchtower </em>along with the tape. It touched my heart, especially the fourth and fifth paragraphs. And then the tears began to flow—but not for long. I am grateful to Jehovah that I am alive and belong to his people and that I, along with so many others, can make his name known. There is indeed no reason to feel worthless. Jehovah’s spirit is with his people. May all of us endure and stand solid in the faith, as one man. With Christian affection, your sister in the faith.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>The Watchtower </em>gives more than information. It touches the hearts of its readers and satisfies their desire for spiritual nourishment and timely encouragement. Yes, <em>The Watchtower </em>provides “food at the proper time.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>.</p>

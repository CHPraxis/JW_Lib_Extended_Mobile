Which Country Could It Be?
People in the developed nations usually view bribery, corruption, and poverty as being endemic in African and Latin-American countries. So to which country does the following quote apply?
“Government ministers lie, businessmen are jailed for corruption, civil servants are caught taking bribes, politics is discredited, and [politicians] are seen as seedy, drink-sodden, and sex-obsessed. . . . Throughout the country, highway robbery is back. . . . The general crime has been accompanied by a wave of corruption in industry, in finance, and in public service. . . . Eleven million people now lack three or more of the basic necessities of life, . . . and the number living in severe poverty—lacking seven or more of the essentials—has gone up from 2.5 million to 3.5 million.”—Phillip Knightley, The Australian Magazine.
Did you guess correctly? The answer is Britain. But it is a sad commentary on our times that the foregoing could apply to dozens of countries. How badly we all need good, honest, upright rulership! Yes, we need God’s rulership by means of that Kingdom for which Jesus taught his followers to pray, “Let your kingdom come.”—Matthew 6:10.

“Out Of the Mouth of Babes”
A woman from Ballito, Natal, South Africa, expressed warm appreciation for the book My Book of Bible Stories and wrote:
“I have a nephew, Rudi Naidoo, who is only one-and-a-half years old, and he names almost every character in the book by simply seeing their pictures. He even tells you what certain Bible characters are doing in the pictures. For example, story 11 shows Noah offering sacrifices. Rudi tells us, ‘Noah—praying Jehovah.’
“When asked what Joshua is doing in story 49, Rudi poses like Joshua in the picture, while he says, ‘Sun stand still!’ He cannot pronounce the words properly but says it in his own funny, sweet way.
“Again, I want to thank you for this excellent publication. Little children are able to relate what some adults don’t know. Jesus’ words at Matthew 21:16 are certainly true: ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.’”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOD’S WORD, the Bible, speaks of a time when God’s heavenly government will have solved all of mankind’s problems, which now include the problem of pollution by automobiles. Will this Messianic Kingdom, for which many have been taught to pray, provide the ideal solution by producing a completely pollution-free automobile? Or will the ideal solution be achieved by ridding the earth of all motor vehicles? Since the Bible gives us no definite answer, we can do nothing more than just wait and see.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But of this we can be sure: God’s government will not allow pollution to mar the beauties of creation in the restored Paradise that the Kingdom will bring about.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:7-23:35:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:25" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 65:17-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since those who adhere to God’s Word are already being trained for life in a pollution-free new world, how should they feel about the use of automobiles today? The <em>Awake! </em>of June 22, 1987, dealt with the subject “What Is Happening to Our Forests?” It reported that some scientists think there is a link between the air pollutants contained in vehicle exhaust and dying forests. This caused one concerned reader to write the Watchtower Society asking whether in view of this fact it would be proper for Christians to drive cars. He wondered if doing so would show disrespect for Jehovah’s creation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">His letter was answered, in part, as follows: “Jehovah’s Witnesses faithfully obey environmental regulations enacted by government authorities to reduce pollution. <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 13:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:7-45:13:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Titus 3:1</a>) Taking measures beyond what the government requires is up to the discretion of the individual. If someone decides to no longer drive a car, that is his own private affair. The <em>Awake! </em>article showed how some people feel, however, by saying on page 8: ‘Many are taking practical steps to cut down on air pollution to the extent reasonably possible. They are driving slower, traveling less, joining car pools, using unleaded gasoline, and obeying antipollution regulations laid down by the government.’”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Christian Balance</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This answer manifested Christian balance. It must be remembered that automobiles are not alone in polluting. Airplanes and trains—in fact, most modern means of transportation—do so. But these modes of transportation were not developed with the express purpose of polluting. The resultant pollution is a side effect, regrettable but due to limited knowledge and imperfect attitudes.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1993006/1-10"><em>The Watchtower </em>of January 1, 1993, page 31</a>, discussed this matter, saying: “As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are deeply concerned with the many ecological problems now affecting our earthly home. More than most people, we appreciate that the earth was created to be a pure, healthful home for a perfect human family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Isaiah 45:18</a>) . . . It is thus right to make balanced, reasonable efforts to avoid needlessly adding to man’s ongoing spoiling of our globe. Note, though, the word ‘reasonable.’ . . . God’s people should not be oblivious of ecological matters. Jehovah required his ancient people to take steps to dispose of wastes, steps that had ecological as well as sanitary import. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:9-5:23:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:9-14</a>) And since we know his view of those who are ruining the earth, we certainly should not ignore things that we can do to keep the environment clean. . . . The extent to which a Christian will go in this direction, however, is a personal matter unless required by law. . . . Imperfect humans easily fall into the trap of being extremists. . . . Human efforts to rid the earth of its major ecological problems, including pollution, will not fully succeed. There may be some progress here and there, but the only lasting solution requires God’s intervention. For this reason we concentrate our efforts and resources on the divine solution, rather than trying to relieve superficial symptoms.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Christians are balanced as they observe Bible principles, keeping in mind the divine commission they have received to preach the message of God’s Kingdom throughout the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Nothing is more important or of greater urgency! If modern means of transportation and communication can help Christians fulfill this obligation, they have every reason to make use of them. At the same time, they avoid unduly or purposely polluting. They thus keep a good conscience before both man and God.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">So although we today do not really know how the problem of pollution and the automobile will finally be solved, we do know that it will be. In fact, the ideal solution is just over the horizon.</p>

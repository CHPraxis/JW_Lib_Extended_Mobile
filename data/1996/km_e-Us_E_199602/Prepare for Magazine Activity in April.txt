Prepare for Magazine Activity in April
As noted on our 1996 Calendar, the Lord’s Evening Meal will be celebrated this year on April 2. Encouraged by this grand occasion, let one and all share in zealous magazine distribution throughout April. What timely magazines we will be using! The Watchtower for April 1 will focus on last year’s district convention public address, “Praise the King of Eternity!” The April 15 Watchtower will follow the theme of last April’s special public talk, “False Religion’s End Is Near.” This year’s special talk on April 21, “Remaining Blameless Amid a Crooked Generation,” should give added impetus. We will be featuring the April 22 Awake! on the topic “When Wars Will Be No More.”
As a follow-up to last April’s Kingdom News campaign, this April should be an outstanding month for magazine distribution. Now is the time to make plans. Many will want to enroll as auxiliary pioneers. As needed, extra copies of the April magazines should be ordered. Plans can be made for Magazine Days, with everyone possible participating—morning, noon, and/or evening. Let all of us “become doers of the word.” As foretold regarding the Messiah at Psalm 69:9, may we also be able to say: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up.”—Jas. 1:22; John 2:17.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The words of the apostle John at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 1:3</a> are good news to us because he tells us how to find happiness. He wrote: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written in it.” The book <em>Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em>has aided many in finding much happiness. We have good reason to offer it to others.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>You might be able to get a conversation started with this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Do you think the Bible book of Revelation was meant to be understood, or was it always to remain a mystery? [Allow for response.] Many share your view. Note what the Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 1:3</a>. [Read.] So Revelation can be understood, and the knowledge that it contains can bring us happiness. How is this possible?” Review thoughts in paragraph 2 on page 6, and then say: “This publication presents a verse-by-verse discussion of the book of Revelation. It will be well worth your time to read it. I’d be pleased to leave this copy with you.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Since many are concerned about providing for their material needs, this might create some interest:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “What do you think is our greatest need? [Allow for response.] There are many who are convinced that we need more material things.” Turn to page 73 and review the main points in the box entitled “Materialism Versus Wisdom.” Continue by saying: “This shows that too much emphasis is being placed on physical things; we should be more concerned about our spiritual needs. True knowledge is what we really need. But knowledge about what?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, and explain how knowledge about God can lead to everlasting life. Offer to leave the book and to come back and show how it reveals marvelous information about God’s purpose to satisfy all the needs of mankind.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Since many are concerned about distress in the world, you might try this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Everyone I talk to is concerned about the future. Some world leaders feel that we are on the verge of a new age of peace. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] In spite of all man’s efforts, violence and distress continue to increase worldwide. The Bible reveals the only lasting solution to these problems. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>. Turn to the illustration on page 302, and explain how God’s heavenly Kingdom will bring lasting peace and security to this earth.] This publication will help you see how you can be part of this new society of people who will enjoy everlasting life under the rule of God’s Kingdom.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>If you encounter someone who is busy and you must be brief, you might say this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Since you only have a moment, I would like to leave this tract [or magazine article] entitled [select appropriate tract or article]. I encourage you to read it. The next time I stop by, I’d like to know what you think of it.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>When offering our literature, give others the opportunity to show their appreciation by contributing toward the costs of the worldwide preaching work. Such giving will add to the happiness they will experience by discerning the meaning of the marvelous prophecies of Revelation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:13-20:3:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 3:13</a>.</p>

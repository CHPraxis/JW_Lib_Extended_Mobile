<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature to be used during <strong>February: </strong>Either <em>Making Your Family Life Happy </em>or <em>Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em><strong>April and May: </strong>Individual copies of both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>For territory that is covered frequently, any brochure (except the <em>Education </em>and <em>School </em>brochures) may also be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. Review points in paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial celebration will be held on Tuesday, April 2, 1996. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Tuesday, you may want to switch these to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March, April, and May should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ On Saturday, May 11, 1996, the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Wallkill, and Patterson, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. So, there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ A packet of legal materials is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters where our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the <em>body of elders only </em>in such a case if it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. Helpful information can be found for those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation litigation in <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:101988760/1-4$p/E:101988761/$p/E:101988762/$p/E:101988763/"><em>Awake! </em>of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14</a>, and the chart found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:101991282/26:93-29:84"><em>Awake! </em>of April 22, 1991, page 9</a>.</p>

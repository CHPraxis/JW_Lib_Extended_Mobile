Help Them Understand
1 The apostle Peter acknowledged that some things stated in the Bible are “hard to understand.” (2 Pet. 3:16) Many have felt that way about the book of Revelation. However, its meaning has been made crystal clear in the book Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! How can we help interested ones to make the best use of it?
2 If you discussed Revelation 1:3 on your initial visit, this thought might stir renewed interest:
▪ “Previously we discussed how an understanding of the book of Revelation can bring happiness. However, such happiness does not come automatically. At least two things are required of us: We must study the Bible, and we must practice what we learn.” Read and comment on James 1:25. Turn to paragraph 9 on page 8, and point out how an understanding of the book of Revelation can help us learn how we can gain happiness in a paradise new world.
3 If you discussed John 17:3 on your first call, you could stress the need for taking in more Bible knowledge by saying:
▪ “The last time I was here, we read at John 17:3 that taking in knowledge about God can lead to everlasting life. But would you want to live forever in the kind of world we live in today? [Allow for response.] Most would not. For this reason, we can rejoice when we hear what God has promised.” Turn to paragraph 6 on page 303, read Revelation 21:4, and then describe what the world will be like when “the former things have passed away.” Offer to return again for further discussion.
4 If you used the illustration on page 302 to show that God’s Kingdom will bring an end to distress, you could open the book to that page again and say:
▪ “We discussed the blessings depicted here that people will enjoy under the rule of God’s Kingdom. What do you think we must do if we want to live under that Kingdom? [Allow for response.] Some people in Bible times set an excellent example that we would do well to imitate.” Read Acts 17:11, stressing the need to ‘examine the Scriptures daily.’ Explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses are helping sincere people in the community to study God’s Word and understand it better.
5 If you left the tract “Will This World Survive?” with a householder who was too busy to converse, you could use this approach:
▪ “When I called recently, you were quite busy. I left a tract with you that raised a question about the world’s survival through these turbulent times. We read Revelation 21:4, which is quoted here in this book, Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! [Read it from paragraph 6 on page 303.] This illustration [on page 302] gives you an idea of what it will be like when ‘God wipes away all tears from our eyes.’ This book offers convincing proof that this promise will be fulfilled in the very near future. If you would like to read it, this is your copy.”
6 If you find interest, you will eventually want to direct attention to the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and use it to start a study. You will surely find much joy in helping “the inexperienced ones understand.”—Ps. 119:130.

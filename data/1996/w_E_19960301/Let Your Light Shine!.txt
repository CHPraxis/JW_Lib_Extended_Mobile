Let Your Light Shine!
AT LAST the time had come for the aged man to set eyes on the promised Messiah! By divine revelation Simeon knew that “he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah.” (Luke 2:26) But what a thrill it was when Simeon entered the temple and Mary and Joseph put the baby Jesus into his arms! He gave praise to God, saying: “Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go free in peace . . . because my eyes have seen your means of saving . . . a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.”—Luke 2:27-32; compare Isaiah 42:1-6.
Jesus, from his baptism at age 30 until his death, proved to be a “light” to the world. In what ways? He radiated spiritual light by preaching about God’s Kingdom and His purposes. He also exposed false religious teachings and clearly identified works that belong to darkness. (Matthew 15:3-9; Galatians 5:19-21) Therefore, Jesus could rightly say: “I am the light of the world.”—John 8:12.
Jesus died in the year 33 C.E. Did the light then go out? By no means! While still on earth, Jesus told his disciples: “Let your light shine before men.” (Matthew 5:16) Accordingly, after Jesus’ death his followers kept the light shining.
In imitation of Jesus, Christians today reflect Jehovah’s light by engaging in the preaching work. They “go on walking as children of light,” proving themselves to be shining examples in Christian living.—Ephesians 5:8.

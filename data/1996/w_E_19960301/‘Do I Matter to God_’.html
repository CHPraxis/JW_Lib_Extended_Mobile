<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“DO I Matter? Does God Care?” Thus read the title of an article appearing in <em>Christianity Today. </em>“Much of my career as a writer has revolved around the problem of pain,” states Philip Yancey, the author of the article. “I return again and again to the same questions, as if fingering an old wound that never quite heals. I hear from readers of my books, and their anguished stories give human faces to my doubts.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Perhaps you too have wondered about God’s interest in your life. Oh, you may be familiar with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>, which states that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son.” Or you may have read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>, which says that Jesus came “to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” Still you might ask, ‘Does God notice <em>me? </em>Does he care about me as an individual?’ There is good reason to believe that he does, as we will see.</p>

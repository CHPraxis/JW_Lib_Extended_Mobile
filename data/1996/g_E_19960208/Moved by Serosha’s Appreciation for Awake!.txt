Moved by Serosha’s Appreciation for Awake!
A young person from the state of Washington, U.S.A., wrote: “In English class we had to write to either a magazine or a newspaper. So I started looking at articles in magazines that I could reply to.
“I decided to look at the articles in the Awake! magazine that came in the mail yesterday. I am very glad that I did. The article ‘A Return Visit to Russia,’ in the February 22, 1995, issue, was very encouraging. It was especially encouraging to read about seven-year-old Serosha’s zeal for God’s Kingdom. His love and appreciation for the Awake! magazine made me think of Awake! articles I haven’t read. I now hope to make an extra effort to read all the wonderful articles in both the Awake! and The Watchtower.”

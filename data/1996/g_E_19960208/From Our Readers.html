<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Witness Assemblies  </strong>Thank you for the experience entitled “A Day That Changed Her Life.” (March 22, 1995) The experience of the young woman whose aunt invited her to a special assembly day of Jehovah’s Witnesses reminded me that the same thing happened to me. I attended my first assembly in the summer of 1985, after being invited by my brother. My initial distrust was soon replaced by a feeling of warmth; I felt as if I was in the middle of one big family. I decided to continue studying the Bible, and today I am a regular pioneer, a full-time evangelizer.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Debt  </strong>Thank you for your article “Does It Pay to Go Into Debt?” (June 8, 1995) I am only 13 years old, but I was not handling my money well. I think this article will help me a great deal.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Slavery  </strong>As an African-American woman, I appreciated very much the June 8, 1995, series of articles “The Chains and Tears of Slavery.” The cover photo brought tears to my eyes. I was touched that you had the courage to address these shameful historical facts. The article was presented with much sensitivity and was most informative.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The article came at just the right time since we were discussing the topic in history class. I used the article to complete some optional homework, and I got good marks. I also felt very sorry for the slaves.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Life Story  </strong>“My Successful Search for the Meaning of Life” (May 22, 1995) was a very moving article. Harold Dies’ story helped me decide whether to enter the full-time ministry. I also had opportunity to visit Bethel, the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, and I was very impressed. There’s no question about my entering the full-time ministry now!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Forgive and Forget  </strong>Thank you for the excellent article “The Bible’s Viewpoint: Forgive and Forget—How Possible?” (June 8, 1995) I used to wonder if the Bible was demanding something impossible from imperfect people. But now I understand what it means to forgive and forget. The article has contributed to my conviction that God’s commandments are not burdensome.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">I just had to write and let you know how much I appreciate the article. As a young child, I was sexually abused by two of my uncles. Later, I was abused and mistreated as a wife. Upon becoming a Christian, I tried to show love and be forgiving. However, I have never been able to say honestly that I forgave these three people who caused me deep pain for many years. I realize now that there are some things that must be left in Jehovah’s hands, and I can get on with my life. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a> assures me that this deep hurt that has affected me will soon be gone.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">I have just finished reading the article, and I have never felt closer to Jehovah God than I do at this very moment. A while ago I was involved in a serious sin for which I sought the help of the congregation elders. Even though I received kind, loving counsel from them, I still felt inhibited in speaking to Jehovah in prayer. This article has given me the clearer understanding that I so desperately needed of how our heavenly Father forgives and forgets. It has enabled me to approach him freely in heartfelt prayer—a privilege that I had foolishly been avoiding. Thanks to Jehovah for giving me my “food at the proper time.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young person from the state of Washington, U.S.A., wrote: “In English class we had to write to either a magazine or a newspaper. So I started looking at articles in magazines that I could reply to.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I decided to look at the articles in the <em>Awake! </em>magazine that came in the mail yesterday. I am very glad that I did. The article ‘A Return Visit to Russia,’ in the February 22, 1995, issue, was very encouraging. It was especially encouraging to read about seven-year-old Serosha’s zeal for God’s Kingdom. His love and appreciation for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine made me think of <em>Awake! </em>articles I haven’t read. I now hope to make an extra effort to read all the wonderful articles in both the <em>Awake! </em>and <em>The Watchtower.”</em></p>

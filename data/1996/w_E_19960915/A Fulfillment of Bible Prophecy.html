<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ON DISPLAY in the Imperial War Museum in London, England, is a unique clock and an electronic digital counter. As the clock revolves, the counter clicks every 3.31 seconds. With each click another number is added to the total. Each click, each number, represents a man, woman, or child who has died as a result of war during this century.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The counter began its tally in June 1989 and is expected to complete the count at midnight on the eve of the year 2000. By then the figure on the counter will register one hundred million—the estimated number of war-related deaths throughout the 20th century.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ foretold a time that would be marked by ‘nation rising against nation and kingdom against kingdom.’ Accordingly, Jehovah’s Witnesses have long been preaching that the devastating wars of this century, along with numerous earthquakes, pestilences, food shortages, and other developments, collectively supply proof that we are living in the “the last days”—the period of time following Christ’s installment as King in heaven in the year 1914.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Using the Bible as its authority, <em>The Watchtower </em>announces the good news that God’s Kingdom will soon destroy oppressors and turn the earth into a paradise. And what about the future of warfare? The Bible states: “Come, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the [war] wagons he burns in the fire.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:8-19:46:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9</a>.</p>

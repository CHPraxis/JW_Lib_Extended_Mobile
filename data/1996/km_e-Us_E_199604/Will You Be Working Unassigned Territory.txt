Will You Be Working Unassigned Territory?
As outlined in the Society’s letter of January 1, 1996, groups of publishers have been invited to assist in covering unassigned territory again this year. If you are part of a group specifically assigned by the Society to work in such territory, the following information will be helpful to you in making your plans: Rather than use booklets and brochures as the main offer, you may use the books You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, or United in Worship of the Only True God. If you do not have a supply of these books available, submit an order right away so that you will have what you need for working unassigned territory.

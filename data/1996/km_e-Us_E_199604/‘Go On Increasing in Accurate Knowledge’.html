<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Accurate knowledge of God leads to everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) We should be doing all we can to increase in accurate knowledge about Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 1:9, 10</a>) Starting on April 29, we will study the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>at the Congregation Book Study. Not only will our own understanding of God’s Word be enhanced but we will also be better equipped to teach it to others. You and your family will be blessed if you prepare in advance, attend and participate each week, and use that information in the ministry.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>One purpose of the preaching work is to find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>) Distribution of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines has proved to be an excellent way to accomplish this, as our journals make people aware of the Kingdom hope. We will be featuring the magazines during April. Hopefully, where interest is found, we can start new Bible studies in the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>Here are some suggestions that might work for you:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When using the April 1 “Watchtower,” you might feature “Praise the King of Eternity!,” which focuses on last year’s district convention public discourse, and say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Many people we talk to have faith in God. Others find it difficult to believe in him. How do you feel? [Allow for response.] We are surrounded by tangible evidence proving that there must be a God. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a>.] When we see a camera or a computer, we readily acknowledge that it must have been produced by an intelligent designer. Would it be reasonable to say that far more complex things, such as the earth and we humans, originated by chance?” Use a paragraph from the article to show a sound reason for believing in God. If interest is shown, offer the magazines.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>The April 15 “Watchtower” features the article “Why True Worship Receives God’s Blessing.” Before presenting it, you could ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “With the hundreds of religions existing in the world, do you think they could all be acceptable to God? [Allow for comment.] Jesus foretold that despite the claims of many religious persons, those not doing God’s will would be rejected. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21-23</a>.] It is important that we identify the true religion taught by Jesus.” Turn to the heading “What Fruitage Must True Religion Produce?,” beginning on page 16, and discuss one example to illustrate the point.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When featuring the main topic in the April 22 “Awake!,” “When Wars Will Be No More,” you might consider saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “In this century there have been hundreds of wars, including two world wars. Yet virtually all world leaders say they want peace. Everybody I know says the same thing. If everyone wants peace, why can’t they achieve it? [Allow for response.] What do you feel is needed for us to see real peace on earth?” After householder’s response, turn to pages 8 and 9 and read such texts as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:8-19:46:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9</a>. Using the pictures and scriptures quoted, show how God’s Kingdom will bring worldwide peace that will last forever. Then ask if the householder wishes to read the magazine, and arrange to return.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>If you find many who say they are busy, you might try this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “We are interested in helping people who live busy lives and who find little time to reflect on the spiritual side of life. Our journals, <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>are designed to provide concise information about important issues that affect you and your family. I’d like to leave these copies for you to read.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Be sure to give those who accept the magazines an opportunity to contribute toward our worldwide work. They will certainly benefit from reading <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>which bring “good news of something better.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 52:7</a>.</p>

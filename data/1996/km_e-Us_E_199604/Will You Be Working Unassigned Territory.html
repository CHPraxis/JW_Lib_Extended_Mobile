<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As outlined in the Society’s letter of January 1, 1996, groups of publishers have been invited to assist in covering unassigned territory again this year. If you are part of a group specifically assigned by the Society to work in such territory, the following information will be helpful to you in making your plans: Rather than use booklets and brochures as the main offer, you may use the books <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>or <em>United in Worship of the Only True God. </em>If you do not have a supply of these books available, submit an order right away so that you will have what you need for working unassigned territory.</p>

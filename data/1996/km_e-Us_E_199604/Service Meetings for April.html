<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Local announcements. Some describe Jehovah’s Witnesses as a “sect” or “cult,” misleading others about our activities and objectives. Using the <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989239/22:235-27:666"><em>Reasoning </em>book, page 202</a>, briefly explain how to refute this charge.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Giving Even Coverage to Our Territory. Talk by service overseer. Scattered or distant areas may rarely be worked. Some may purposely avoid working in localities where people are affluent or strongly religious. Business territories may be neglected. Some publishers may regularly request territories they personally prefer rather than those currently needing coverage. Encourage all to cooperate with efforts to cover unworked territories. The summer months usually provide a good opportunity to work distant rural areas; perhaps car groups can be organized. Make sure the territory is thoroughly covered, including not-at-homes, before it is returned. Offer other practical suggestions showing how all can assist in giving the best coverage to your territory.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Offer <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>During May. Feature individual copies. In territory that is covered frequently, offer any appropriate brochure. Keep a record of all placements, with the goal of establishing a magazine route. Where there is sustained interest, subscriptions may be offered. Emphasize the far-reaching benefits of magazine distribution as one of the most effective means of getting the Kingdom message to the public. Make sure we have a supply when we go in service; offer them at every opportunity. Personal arrangements for a weekly Magazine Day are a good way to increase placements. Store-to-store work and street witnessing with magazines are also productive. Follow up interest with return visits that are designed to start studies, using the <em>Knowledge </em>book. Have one or two brief demonstrations offering the current issues, perhaps using presentations found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:201995330/9-14">September 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>page 3, paragraphs 3-5</a>; read paragraph 6.</p>

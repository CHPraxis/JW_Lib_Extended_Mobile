Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: Individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! For territory that is covered frequently, any appropriate brochure may also be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. June: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. July and August: Any of the following 32-page brochures: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?, and When Someone You Love Dies. Where appropriate, brochures such as Our Problems—Who Will Help Us Solve Them?, Spirits of the Dead—Can They Help You or Harm You? Do They Really Exist?, and Will There Ever Be a World Without War? may be offered.
▪ Where practical, as daylight hours increase, elders should make arrangements for the congregation to spend more time in evening witnessing.
▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 1996 in Chinese, English, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). It is necessary to request plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation who desire them.
▪ An adjustment is being made in the procedure for replacing Pioneer Service Identification cards. From now on, replacement cards for pioneers who move, change their name, lose their card, or request a change of assignment will be supplied by the Society. Any blank cards the secretary may have on file should be disposed of. Name changes and reassignments will be handled in the normal manner, with the secretary noting the appropriate information on the back of the Congregation Report (S-1) for the month. Thereafter, the Society will forward to the congregation the new cards for the pioneers. These will generally come with the monthly statement. Any changes should be forwarded to the Society promptly so that our files can be kept accurate and current. Also, when a pioneer discontinues such service or is deleted, a copy of the S-206 form should be filled out and submitted to the Society without delay.
▪ All inquiries relative to dates and locations of district conventions in other lands should be directed to the respective branch offices. Addresses of branch offices around the world are found on the last page of the Yearbook.
▪ Braille editions of The Watchtower are now available in Korean and Portuguese.

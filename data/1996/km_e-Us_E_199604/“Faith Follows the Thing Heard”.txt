“Faith Follows the Thing Heard”
1 When we find someone who is “rightly disposed for everlasting life,” it is necessary to strengthen that person’s faith in what he has heard. (Acts 13:48; Rom. 10:17) To that end, we should follow up magazine placements by returning to bring the latest issues and to converse more. Where there is genuine interest, subscriptions may be offered. However, have in mind the goal of starting a study in the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Here are some suggestions that might be helpful:
2 When making a return visit where you discussed the article “Praise the King of Eternity!,” you could begin this way:
▪ “When we last talked, we reviewed some of the overwhelming evidence that proves there is an almighty God. However, just being aware of his existence is not enough. We need to know his name. By what name do you call God? [Allow for response.] Millions of people simply call him ‘Lord’ or ‘God,’ which are impersonal titles. In addition, he wants us to know him by his name. [Read Psalm 83:18.] The Bible tells us much more about Jehovah God, as is explained in this book.” Show the picture on page 29 of the Knowledge book, and read the caption. After you discuss the first three paragraphs in chapter 3, you will have started a study!
3 For those with whom you considered the article “Why Worldly Religion Will End,” you may want to follow up the interest by saying:
▪ “After reading the article, you may have been impressed with the fact that we cannot view all religions in the same way. Both true religion and false religions exist. This raises the logical question, Whose worship does God accept? The answer was provided by Jesus, and it is highlighted in this book.” Turn to chapter 5 in the Knowledge book, and read paragraph 4, including John 4:23, 24. Then ask, “Would you be willing to accept a free home Bible study?” If the response is positive, turn to chapter 1 and start the study.
4 If interest was shown in the April 22 “Awake!,” when you return you might try this approach to start a study in the “Knowledge” book:
▪ “You may recall we had a conversation about our prospects for eventually seeing a world without war. It’s hard to imagine what that would really be like. Here’s one artist’s conception of it. [Show the picture on pages 188-9 in the Knowledge book.] Wouldn’t it be a pleasure to be able to enjoy these surroundings? [Turn to pages 4-5, show the picture, and read the box.] The title of this book is similar to Jesus’ words found at John 17:3. [Read.] If I may, I’d like to demonstrate how this book can be used with your Bible to find that lifesaving knowledge.” If the householder is willing, start the study in the first chapter.
5 If you contacted a person who was busy when you initially called, you might say this when you return:
▪ “I visited you recently and left copies of the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. These journals build respect for the Bible and its moral guidance. Because I feel it is essential for everyone to understand God’s Word, I came back to show you something that will help you to do that.” Show the Knowledge book, and point to contents on page 3. Ask which chapter looks the most interesting, turn to it, and start the study.
6 Our joy will be great if we are able to ‘open to others the door to faith’ leading to everlasting life.—Acts 14:27; John 17:3.

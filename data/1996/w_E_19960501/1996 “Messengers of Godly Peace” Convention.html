<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN ANCIENT times Jehovah’s people celebrated three major festivals annually. Rather similarly, in modern times Jehovah’s name people meet three times a year for festive occasions. They enjoy gathering for the one-day special assembly day, the two-day circuit assembly, and the three- or four-day district convention. This year, the theme of the district convention is “Messengers of Godly Peace.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How fitting that theme is! Our God, Jehovah, is “the God of peace,” yes, “the God who gives peace.” Our Leader, Jesus Christ, is the “Prince of Peace,” and the message that servants of Jehovah bring is a message of godly peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:9-50:4:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:33-45:15:33" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Romans 15:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isaiah 9:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:15-34:1:15" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Nahum 1:15</a>) A fine convention program has been arranged that will help all to appreciate more fully the importance of godly peace.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This year in the United States alone, there will be 198 conventions. Likely, there will be a convention near you. Why not check with Jehovah’s Witnesses in your neighborhood about exactly when and where it will be and then make plans to attend? All who are interested in real, lasting peace will receive a warm welcome.</p>

Speak Truth to Your Neighbor
1 One of the two greatest commandments is: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) Such love will prompt us to share with our neighbor the best thing we have—the truth that we have found in God’s Word. Since the Watchtower and Awake! magazines amplify the Bible’s message of truth, distributing these journals during the month of May is one way for us to ‘speak truth with our neighbors.’—Eph. 4:25.
2 The April 22 “Awake!” should be featured until your supply is exhausted. You might initiate your presentation by asking:
▪ “What is your reaction to a world without war? [Allow for response.] Did you know that the world’s religions actually promote wars and killing? [Allow for response.] In sharp contrast, notice what the Bible says the true worshipers of God will do.” Read Isaiah 2:2-4 from the top of page 4 of the magazine, and then on page 10 read the first paragraph under the subheading “Calling to Lovers of Peace.” Next, ask: “Do you know how God will do that? The answer is found in this magazine, and this is your copy to read.”
3 When offering the May 15 “Watchtower,” try referring to a recent news event that has caused people to feel insecure, and then ask:
▪ “What do you think it would take to make us feel truly secure in this life? [Allow for response.] In all honesty, is it realistic to trust in humans to solve the problems facing mankind? [Allow for response; then read Psalm 146:3.] The psalmist next gives us reason to be optimistic about the future. [Read Psalm 146:5, 6.] This article, ‘True Security, Now and Forever,’ explains why we can trust in Jehovah God to bring better conditions to the earth.” Offer to leave a set of magazines and to return to discuss how it is possible to enjoy a secure life right now.
4 The cover story of the May 22 “Awake!” should capture the interest of people in both house-to-house and business territory. You could introduce it by saying:
▪ “Many women have experienced the nightmare of sexual harassment in the workplace. The situation has become so serious that courts have begun to punish offenders and compensate victims. As a service to the community, we have published this report, which dispels common myths about the matter. It also provides practical ideas for women and for men as to how to protect themselves from becoming either a victim or one accused of sexual harassment. Would you like to read this issue of Awake! magazine? [Allow for response.] While we leave our journals without charge, we do accept small donations for our worldwide work.”
5 If you prefer a brief presentation, you might try this:
▪ “Many feel that most of today’s popular magazines feature too much commercialism, sex, or violence. [Show The Watchtower and Awake!] We’re distributing these wholesome journals that are based on the Bible. They are very educational and teach us to worship God, love our neighbor, and maintain upright conduct. If you prefer this type of reading material, I know you’ll enjoy what you find in these issues.”
6 If we are zealous in speaking the truth to our neighbors, we may be able to bring a great deal of joy to many.—Acts 8:4, 8.

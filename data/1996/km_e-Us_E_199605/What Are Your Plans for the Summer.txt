What Are Your Plans for the Summer?
When we think of summer, we think of warm weather, arrangements to attend a district convention, and plans for a relaxing vacation or a pleasant visit with relatives and friends. When making your summer plans, here are a few reminders that may help you to keep Kingdom interests in first place:
▪ Make definite plans to attend the district convention. Arrange for your transportation and accommodations well in advance in order to avoid any problems.
▪ If you go away for a vacation, plan to attend the meetings of the local congregation and share in the ministry. Be sure to turn in your field service reports; if necessary, mail them to your congregation’s secretary.
▪ A visit with relatives who are not in the truth may give you a chance to do some productive informal witnessing. Be sure to bring your Bible and a supply of literature.
▪ Have you thought about helping a nearby congregation that needs assistance in covering its territory? Talk to the elders or the circuit overseer to get information about the needs in your area.
▪ School vacations provide an excellent opportunity for young people to expand their service activity. Youths, can you enroll as auxiliary pioneers?
▪ With pleasant weather and longer daylight hours, you may find that you can get excellent results in the service by doing more evening witnessing, when many people are at home.
▪ Elders should be alert to keep congregation activities well organized, arranging for someone to care for the responsibilities assigned to those who will be away.
Remember that “the plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” (Prov. 21:5) Plan to make the most of your summertime theocratic opportunities.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostles declared: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:20-44:4:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 4:20</a>) Today we too must keep on <em>speaking </em>the truth. Although the distribution of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>is a means for locating those who will listen, we must return if we are to teach interested ones more of the truth.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When following up a placement of the special April “Awake!” with its topic “When Wars Will Be No More,” you could introduce a Bible study by asking:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Last time, we talked about the wars of the nations and religion’s part in them. Had you realized that such events clearly prove we are living in what the Bible calls the last days? [Show the <em>Knowledge </em>book. Read the first paragraph of chapter 11, and highlight the box on page 102.] This book explains this subject along with 18 others listed here in the contents. [Show page 3.] If I may, I’d like to demonstrate how this book can help you to get an understanding of these important Bible matters.” If allowed, start a study on page 6.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you promised to return and explain how it is possible to enjoy a secure life now, you might say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “When we first met, I shared with you a passage from the Bible that gives us reason for optimism about man’s future. Today I would like to call your attention to something that shows who it is that can give us a feeling of security right now.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:4:8-19:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 4:8</a>. Turn in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995028/26-26"><em>Knowledge </em>book to page 168 and read paragraph 19</a>. Then ask: “Would you enjoy having a free home Bible study that shows clearly how you too can find this kind of security in your life?” If the answer is yes, turn to chapter 1.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>To add to your magazine route those with whom you placed the May 22 </em>“<em>Awake!,</em>” <em>you could try this approach:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “You seemed quite eager to read the <em>Awake! </em>magazine that I left with you on the subject of sexual harassment in the workplace. Did you find the material interesting? [Allow for response.] Regular readers of <em>Awake! </em>often say they appreciate its fair and thorough treatment of such important subjects. I think you will find that to be true also of this latest issue. [Briefly feature the cover story.] Would you like to read it?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You could make a direct offer of a study on the return visit by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “We distribute our magazines worldwide to inform people everywhere about what the Bible teaches. If individuals appreciate what they learn, we offer a free home Bible study. [Refer to the box ‘Would You Welcome a Visit?’ on the back cover of <em>The Watchtower.</em>] We use this book, <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, </em>as a guide. Let me briefly show you how a study is conducted.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>If we keep on speaking the truth, we can be sure that there will be some who will listen and respond favorably.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:20-41:4:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 4:20</a>.</p>

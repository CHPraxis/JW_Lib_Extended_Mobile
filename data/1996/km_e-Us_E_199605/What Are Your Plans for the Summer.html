<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When we think of summer, we think of warm weather, arrangements to attend a district convention, and plans for a relaxing vacation or a pleasant visit with relatives and friends. When making your summer plans, here are a few reminders that may help you to keep Kingdom interests in first place:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Make definite plans to attend the district convention. Arrange for your transportation and accommodations well in advance in order to avoid any problems.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ If you go away for a vacation, plan to attend the meetings of the local congregation and share in the ministry. Be sure to turn in your field service reports; if necessary, mail them to your congregation’s secretary.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ A visit with relatives who are not in the truth may give you a chance to do some productive informal witnessing. Be sure to bring your Bible and a supply of literature.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Have you thought about helping a nearby congregation that needs assistance in covering its territory? Talk to the elders or the circuit overseer to get information about the needs in your area.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ School vacations provide an excellent opportunity for young people to expand their service activity. Youths, can you enroll as auxiliary pioneers?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ With pleasant weather and longer daylight hours, you may find that you can get excellent results in the service by doing more evening witnessing, when many people are at home.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ Elders should be alert to keep congregation activities well organized, arranging for someone to care for the responsibilities assigned to those who will be away.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Remember that “the plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) Plan to make the most of your summertime theocratic opportunities.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>All of us like to find joy and accomplishment in what we do, especially in the disciple-making work. What brings us such satisfaction? It starts with our maintaining a positive mental attitude while we keep busy in the worthwhile work of helping others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 11:25</a>) Our manner in presenting the good news should show that we truly believe what we are saying. If we speak from our heart, then our sincerity and personal conviction will shine through. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>) By rehearsing our presentation, we will feel more confident when speaking to the people in the territory. This will be of particular value during September when we offer the book <em>Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>You may find the following suggestions helpful in presenting the good news with a positive attitude.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When offering the “Creation” book, you could say this on the initial call:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“In talking to our neighbors, we have found that some put their confidence in God. Others find it difficult to believe in him. How do you feel? [Allow for response.] Notice how the Bible reasons on this matter. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>.] We can see proof of God’s ‘eternal power and Godship’ by observing the things he created.” Read the last paragraph on <a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985014/98-103">page 48 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book, and draw attention to the complexity of the living cell. Or use paragraph 18 on page 147 to show how a tree’s amazing circulatory system highlights the work of a Creator. Offer to let the person have the book if he will agree to read it. If he does, place it with him, and explain that we gladly accept donations for our worldwide work.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When returning to visit those with whom you discussed God’s Creatorship, you might wish to say this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“On my previous visit, we talked about the evidence for God’s existence—his marvelous creation. Do you find it hard to believe that the One who created the universe would also be interested in our future? [Allow for response.] It is of interest to note that the future has already been determined by the Creator.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:9, 10</a>. Depending on the individual’s interest, use the pictures and captions in <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985029/">chapter 19 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book to highlight the ideal conditions promised by God. Read paragraph 1 of chapter 20, and offer a Bible study. If accepted, start the study in the <em>Knowledge </em>book.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“In speaking with people in the neighborhood, I have observed that most long for a safe community and a peaceful world. What is your opinion as to why man has failed to achieve such conditions? [Allow for response.] Some leaders may be sincere and do some good, but notice what the Bible wisely counsels.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a>; then ask: “Is there anyone who can satisfy man’s needs?” Read verses 5 and 6. Show the picture on <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985030/18:147-20">page 251 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book, and draw attention to the benefits of God’s rule. Offer the book, and mention our arrangement for donations.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“When I was here a few days ago, we discussed the failure of man to bring about real peace on earth. You may recall that we determined the reason the Bible gives for such failure. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3</a> again.] Did you notice why God advises us not to pin our hopes on humans? [Allow for response.] Perhaps you agree that any hope for a permanent solution has to come from God. The reason we can have this confidence is explained at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:10-19:146:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 146:10</a>.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“Today we are rendering a special service to the businesspeople of the community.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“On my last visit, I mentioned that God is the only one who really has the lasting solution to crime and violence.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Much of the time allotted for the <em>Watchtower </em>Study and the Congregation Book Study is used for the reading of the paragraphs. This means that the brother assigned as reader carries a heavy responsibility as a teacher. He must read in a manner that will ‘put meaning’ into the material so that listeners not only will understand it but also will be motivated to action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8</a>) Hence, the reader needs to prepare well for his assignment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:13-54:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:13</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:1101971055/">study 6 of the <em>School Guidebook</em></a><em>.</em>) Here are some essentials for meaningful public reading.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Use Proper Sense Stress: </strong>Determine in advance which words or phrases need to be emphasized in order to convey the correct understanding.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Pronounce Words Correctly: </strong>Proper pronunciation and clear enunciation are necessary if the audience is to comprehend expressions that appear in the publication. Look up unfamiliar or seldom-used words in a dictionary, or listen to the Society’s cassette recordings.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Speak With Volume and Enthusiasm: </strong>Speaking up enthusiastically creates interest, stirs the emotions, and motivates the listener.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Be Warm and Conversational: </strong>Naturalness comes with fluency. With preparation and practice, the reader can be relaxed, and the result will be appealing instead of monotonous and tedious.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:2-35:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hab. 2:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Read the Material as Printed: </strong>Footnotes as well as information in parentheses or brackets are ordinarily read aloud if they clarify the printed text. The only exceptions are references that simply identify source material. A footnote should be read where it is referred to in the paragraph, prefacing it by stating: “The footnote reads . . .” After reading it, simply continue with the rest of the paragraph.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When public reading is done well, it is one of the vital ways that we can ‘teach others to observe all the things commanded’ by our Great Teacher.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>.</p>

▪ Literature offer for September: Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? Congregations having You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth or Making Your Family Life Happy in stock may offer these books. October: Individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. November: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to follow up on all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies. December: New World Translation with the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make an announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ Publishers planning to serve as auxiliary pioneers in October should turn in an application early. This will allow the elders to make necessary arrangements for magazines, literature, and territory.
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower, regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated persons who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.

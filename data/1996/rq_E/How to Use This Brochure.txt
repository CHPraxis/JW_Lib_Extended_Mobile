How to Use This Brochure
This brochure is designed as a Bible study course. How is it to be used? We suggest the following program: At the beginning of each lesson, there are questions. In parentheses after each question, you will find the numbers of the paragraphs in which the answers are found. Read the questions through first. Think about them. Then read each paragraph, and look up the scriptures in your Bible. When you have finished a lesson, go back to the questions and try to recall the Bibleâ€™s answer to each question. When you have finished the whole brochure, go back and review all the questions.

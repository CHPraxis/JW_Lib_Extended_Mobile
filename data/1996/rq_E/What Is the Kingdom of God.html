<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">1. When he was on earth, Jesus taught his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom. A kingdom is a government that is headed by a king. God’s Kingdom is a special government. It is set up in heaven and will rule over this earth. It will sanctify, or make holy, God’s name. It will cause God’s will to be done on earth as it is done in heaven.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">2. God promised that Jesus would become the King of His Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-33</a>) When Jesus was on earth, he proved that he would be a kind, just, and perfect Ruler. When he returned to heaven, he was not enthroned as King of God’s Kingdom right away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:12-58:10:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>) In 1914, Jehovah gave Jesus the authority He had promised him. Since then, Jesus has ruled in heaven as Jehovah’s appointed King.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">3. Jehovah has also selected some faithful men and women from the earth to go to heaven. They will rule with Jesus as kings, judges, and priests over mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 5:9, 10</a>) Jesus called these corulers in his Kingdom a “little flock.” They number 144,000.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 12:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Revelation 14:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">4. As soon as Jesus became King, he threw Satan and his wicked angels out of heaven and down to the locality of the earth. That is why things have become so bad here on earth since 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Wars, famines, pestilences, increasing lawlessness—all these are part of a “sign” indicating <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>that Jesus is ruling and that this system is in its last days.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:8" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Luke 21:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">5. Soon Jesus will judge people, separating them as a shepherd separates sheep from goats. The “sheep” are those who will have proved themselves his loyal subjects. They will receive everlasting life on earth. The “goats” are those who will have rejected God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:34" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 46</a>) In the near future, Jesus will destroy all goatlike ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:6-9</a>) If you want to be one of Jesus’ “sheep,” you must listen to the Kingdom message and act on what you learn.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">6. Now the earth is divided up into many countries. Each has its own government. These nations often fight one another. But God’s Kingdom will replace all human governments. It will rule as the only government over the entire earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) Then there will be no more war, crime, and violence. All people will live together in peace and unity.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Micah 4:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">7. During Jesus’ Thousand Year Reign, faithful humans will become perfect, and the whole earth will become a paradise. By the end of the thousand years, Jesus will have done everything God asked him to do. Then he will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>) Why not tell your friends and loved ones about what God’s Kingdom will do?</p>

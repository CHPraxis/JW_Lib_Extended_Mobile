<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sa">What are two ways we can learn about God? (6)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">1. People worship many things. But the Bible tells us that there is only one TRUE God. He created everything in heaven and on earth. Because he gave us life, he is the only One we should worship.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">2. God has many titles but has only one name. That name is JEHOVAH. In most Bibles, God’s name has been removed and has been replaced with the titles L<span class="altsize">ORD </span>or G<span class="altsize">OD</span>. But when the Bible was written, the name Jehovah appeared in it some 7,000 times!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:15-2:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Psalm 83:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">3. Jehovah has a body, but it is not like ours. “God is a Spirit,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) A spirit is a form <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>of life that is much higher than ours. No human has ever seen God. Jehovah lives in heaven, but he can see all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 11:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 1:18</a>) What, though, is the holy spirit? It is not a person like God. Rather, it is God’s active force.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:30-19:104:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 104:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">4. The Bible reveals Jehovah’s personality to us. It shows that his outstanding qualities are love, justice, wisdom, and power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:13-18:12:13" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Job 12:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Isaiah 40:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>) The Bible tells us that he is also merciful, kind, forgiving, generous, and patient. We, like obedient children, should try to imitate him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">5. Should we bow down or pray to images, pictures, or symbols in our worship? No! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 20:4, 5</a>) Jehovah says that we must worship only him. He will not share his glory with anyone or anything else. Images have no power to help us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:4-19:115:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 115:4-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Isaiah 42:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">6. How can we get to know God better? One way is by observing the things he has created and thinking deeply about what they tell us. God’s creations show us that he has great power and wisdom. We see his love in all that he has made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 19:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Romans 1:20</a>) Another way we can learn about God is by studying the Bible. In it he tells us much more about the kind of God he is. He also tells us about his purpose and what he wants us to do.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:7-30:3:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Amos 3:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

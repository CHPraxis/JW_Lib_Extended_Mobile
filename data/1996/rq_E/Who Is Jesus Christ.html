<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">1. Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit person before he came to earth. He was God’s first creation, and so he is called the “firstborn” Son of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 3:14</a>) Jesus is the only Son that God created by himself. Jehovah used the prehuman Jesus as his “master worker” in creating all other things in heaven and on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:22-20:8:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:16, 17</a>) God also used him as His chief spokesman. That is why Jesus is called “the Word.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:13-66:19:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Revelation 19:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">2. God sent His Son to the earth by transferring his life to the womb of Mary. So Jesus did not have a human father. That is why he did not inherit any sin or imperfection. God sent Jesus to earth for three reasons: (1) To teach us the truth about God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>), (2) to maintain perfect integrity, providing a model for us to follow (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>), and (3) to sacrifice his life to set us free from sin and death. Why was this needed?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">3. By disobeying God’s command, the first man, Adam, committed what the Bible calls “sin.” So God sentenced him to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) He no longer measured up to God’s standards, so he was not perfect anymore. Slowly he grew old and died. Adam passed on sin to all his children. That is why we also grow old, get sick, and die. How could mankind be saved?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>4. Jesus was a perfect human just like Adam. Unlike Adam, though, Jesus was perfectly obedient to God under even the greatest test. He could therefore sacrifice his perfect human life to pay for Adam’s sin. This is what the Bible refers to as the “ransom.” Adam’s children could thus be released from condemnation to death. All who put their faith in Jesus can have their sins forgiven and receive everlasting life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:18-45:5:19" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Romans 5:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">5. When on earth Jesus cured the sick, fed the hungry, and calmed storms. He even raised the dead. Why did he perform miracles? (1) He felt pity for people who were suffering, and he wanted to help them. (2) His miracles proved that he was God’s Son. (3) They showed what he will do for obedient mankind when he rules as King over the earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:14-40:14:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 14:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:10-41:2:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mark 2:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">6. Jesus died and was resurrected by God as a spirit creature, and he returned to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18</a>) Since then, God has made him a King. Soon Jesus will remove all wickedness and suffering from this earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">1. The Bible is a precious gift from God. It is like a letter from a loving father to his children. It tells us the truth about God—who he is and what he stands for. It explains how to cope with problems and how to find true happiness. The Bible alone tells us what we must do to please God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">2. The Bible was written by some 40 different men over a period of 1,600 years, beginning in 1513 B.C.E. It is made up of 66 little books. Those who wrote the Bible were inspired by God. They wrote his thoughts, not their own. So God in heaven, not any human on earth, is the Author of the Bible.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">3. God made sure that the Bible was accurately copied and preserved. More Bibles have been printed than any other book. Not everyone will be happy to see you studying the Bible, but do not let that stop you. Your eternal future depends on your getting to know God and doing his will despite any opposition.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:10-40:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 17:3</a>.</p>

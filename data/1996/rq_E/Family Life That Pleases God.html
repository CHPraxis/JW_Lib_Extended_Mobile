<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">1. The Bible says that a husband is the head of his family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) A husband must have only one wife. They should be properly married in the eyes of the law.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Titus 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">2. A husband should love his wife just as he loves himself. He should treat her the way Jesus treats his followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) He should never hit his wife or mistreat her in any way. Rather, he should show her honor and respect.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">3. A father should work hard to care for his family. He must provide food, clothing, and housing for his wife and children. A father must also provide for his family’s spiritual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) He takes the lead in helping his family to learn about God and His purposes.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">4. A wife should be a good helper for her husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 2:18</a>) She should assist her husband in teaching and training their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:8-20:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8</a>) Jehovah requires a wife to care for her family lovingly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:15-20:31:15" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:26-20:31:27" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:4-56:2:5" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Titus 2:4, 5</a>) She should have deep respect for her husband.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:22, 23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 33</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">5. God requires children to obey <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>their parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>) He expects parents to instruct and correct their children. Parents need to spend time with their children and study the Bible with them, caring for their spiritual and emotional needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:18-5:11:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 11:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Proverbs 22:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 15</a>) Parents should never discipline their children in a harsh or cruel way.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">6. When marriage mates have problems getting along together, they should try to apply Bible counsel. The Bible urges us to show love and to be forgiving. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12-14</a>) God’s Word does not encourage separation as a way to solve minor problems. But a wife might choose to leave her husband if (1) he stubbornly refuses to support his family, (2) he is so violent that her health and life are in danger, or (3) his extreme opposition makes it impossible for her to worship Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:12-46:7:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">7. Marriage mates must be faithful to each other. Adultery is a sin against God and against one’s mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>) Sex relations outside the marriage is the only Scriptural ground for divorce allowing for remarriage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:6-40:19:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:2-45:7:3" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Romans 7:2, 3</a>) Jehovah hates it when people get divorced without Scriptural grounds and marry someone else.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:14-39:2:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Malachi 2:14-16</a>.</p>

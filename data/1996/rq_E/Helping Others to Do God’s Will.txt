Lesson 15
Helping Others to Do God’s Will
Why tell others about what you are learning? (1)
With whom can you share the good news? (2)
What effect can your conduct have on others? (2)
When can you preach along with the congregation? (3)
1. By now you have learned many good things from the Bible. This knowledge should lead to your cultivating a Christian personality. (Ephesians 4:22-24) Such knowledge is essential in order for you to gain eternal life. (John 17:3) However, others also need to hear the good news so that they too can be saved. All true Christians must witness to others. It is God’s command.—Romans 10:10; 1 Corinthians 9:16; 1 Timothy 4:16.
2. You can start by sharing with those near you the good things you are learning. Tell them to your family, friends, schoolmates, and workmates. Be kind and patient as you do so. (2 Timothy 2:24, 25) Remember that people often look at someone’s conduct more than they listen to what he says. So your good conduct may draw others to listen to the message you tell them.—Matthew 5:16; 1 Peter 3:1, 2, 16.
3. In time, you may qualify to begin preaching with the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This is an important step in your progress. (Matthew 24:14) What a joy it would be if you were able to help someone else to become a servant of Jehovah and gain eternal life!—1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">1. To become a friend of God, you must <em>obtain a good knowledge of Bible truth </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>), <em>put faith in the things you have learned </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>), <em>repent of your sins </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:30, 31</a>), and <em>turn around in your course of life. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) Then your love for God should move you to <em>dedicate yourself to him. </em>This means that in a personal, private prayer you tell him that you are giving yourself to him to do his will<strong>.</strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:37</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">2. After you have made your dedication to God, you should <em>be baptized. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) Baptism lets everyone know that you have dedicated yourself to Jehovah. So baptism is only for those who are old enough to make a decision to serve God. When a person is baptized, his whole body should be put under the water momentarily.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:9-41:1:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 1:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:36-44:8:36" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Acts 8:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">3. After you have made a dedication, Jehovah will expect you to live up to your promise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:14-19:50:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 50:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5</a>) The Devil will try to stop you from serving Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) But draw close to God in prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>) Study his Word each day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>) Stick close to the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:17</a>) By doing all of this, you will gain the strength to stay faithful to God. For all eternity you thus can do the things that God requires of you!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostle Paul explained that it is ‘God’s will that all sorts of men should come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) How can we help others to take in that knowledge? One way is by making return visits on persons whose interest has been aroused by means of the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>This publication presents Bible truth in clear, simple, well-chosen words. By studying it, people of all sorts can be led to life. What can we say that will encourage others to study it with us?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>For those who showed an interest in the Bible as a practical guide, you could return to offer a study, perhaps saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “When I was here before, we discussed why we can trust the Bible as a practical source of guidance. Because of its being inspired by God, the Bible is also a sure source of comfort and hope, even as one of Christ’s apostles stated. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.] At the end of our last conversation, I raised the question, How can we personally benefit from the knowledge contained in the Bible?” Read <a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995012/24-24">paragraph 18 on page 11 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book. Point out that Jehovah’s Witnesses are conducting some five million Bible studies worldwide, helping people everywhere to take in the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. Offer a brief demonstration of how a study is conducted, using the first five paragraphs in chapter 1.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If prayer was the topic you initially discussed with someone, you might try this approach in an effort to start a study:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “I hope you enjoyed the information about prayer that we discussed from the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>I promised to come back and consider with you how those who pray to God can, in turn, listen to him. Notice what is stated on page 158. [Read paragraph 18.] Thus, by personally studying the Bible, we are listening to what God has to say to us. Doing that draws us closer to him and helps us to deal with the day-to-day problems about which we pray. It would be my pleasure to study the Bible with you.” If the person is willing, begin with the first chapter of the <em>Knowledge </em>book.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you used the direct approach to start a study, you might say this to follow up the initial discussion:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “I made a special effort to stop by again because I wanted to tell you more about our free Bible study program. I left with you a copy of this book, <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, </em>which is the study aid that we use. Notice how it encourages us to consider God’s Word. [Read paragraph 23 on page 22.] If you would please get your copy of the book, perhaps we can continue studying where we left off the last time.” If a study was not started on the initial call, you might say: “Perhaps this would be a good time for me to demonstrate how we study the Bible.” After considering a few paragraphs, arrange a definite time to return for the next study.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Using the <em>Knowledge </em>book effectively will enable us to spread about accurate knowledge for the blessing of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:7-20:15:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 15:7</a>) Such knowledge will bring delight to those whose hearts are right, and it will be a powerful incentive for them to live in harmony with Jehovah’s righteousness, leading eventually to everlasting life.</p>

▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ As announced in the January 1996 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, the special public talk for the Memorial season this year will be presented in most congregations on Sunday, April 21. The talk is entitled “Remaining Blameless Amid a Crooked Generation.” A special effort should be made to invite those who attend the Memorial on April 2.
▪ Congregations may now begin submitting requests for the videocassettes Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life (Volumes 2-6) in American Sign Language.

Efforts will be made to ship each videocassette in time for the material contained in it to be considered at the Congregation Book Study.
▪ The dates for the first Long Beach, California, district convention have been changed from May 31–June 2 to August 9-11, 1996.

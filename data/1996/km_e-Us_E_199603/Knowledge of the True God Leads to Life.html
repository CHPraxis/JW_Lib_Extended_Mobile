<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“This means everlasting life,” said Jesus in prayer to his Father, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) What a generous reward that is! By using the publication <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, </em>we can help others learn what they need to do to live forever. What can we say to arouse their interest and prompt them to want to read the <em>Knowledge </em>book?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>You might use a presentation that features the Bible as a practical source of guidance, by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “We are discussing with our neighbors where to find a practical source of guidance for coping with the problems of life. In the past many people first consulted the Bible. But now people’s attitudes have changed; many are skeptical about the Bible, viewing it simply as a book written by men. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.] There is a very good reason why it can be said that the Bible is practical for our day. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.] Bible principles apply just as much now as they did when God inspired the writing of the Bible.” Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995013/15-17">page 16 in the <em>Knowledge</em></a> book, and briefly comment on the practical guidance found in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. Read the quote found in paragraph 11 or the one in paragraph 13. Offer the book, and arrange to return to answer the question, How can we personally benefit from the knowledge contained in the Bible?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Since prayer is a topic of interest for many people, you might like to discuss it by asking:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “With all the challenges we must face in modern-day life, do you feel that prayer can be of real help to us? [Wait for a response.] Many feel that they have drawn close to God by praying to him and that doing so has given them inner strength, which is just what the Bible promises. [Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995027/20:109-23:543"><em>Knowledge </em>book to page 156</a>, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.] Even so, a person may feel his prayers sometimes go unanswered. This chapter discusses ‘How You Can Draw Close to God.’ [Offer the book, and mention the donation arrangement for the worldwide work.] This chapter also explains how we can listen to God, since communication with him is not one-sided. We can discuss that when I come next time.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “We are offering a free home Bible study course. Have you ever taken a Bible course before? [Allow for response.] Let me show you the study aid that we use.” Display the <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995031/1-22"><em>Knowledge </em>book, turn to page 3</a> so that the householder can see the table of contents, and ask, “Have you ever wondered what the Bible has to say about these subjects?” Turn to the chapter about which the most interest is shown, and read the subheadings. Explain that you would like to demonstrate briefly how we cover this information in our study course. Whether a study is started or not, leave the book if the person promises to read it.</p>

Memorial Reminders
The following are matters that need attention before the Memorial observance on Tuesday, April 2:
▪ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and place for the celebration.
▪ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.—See the February 15, 1985, Watchtower, page 19.
▪ A suitable table, a tablecloth, plates, and glasses should be brought to the hall in advance and put in place.
▪ The Kingdom Hall or other place of meeting should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time.
▪ Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about the proper procedure and their duties.
▪ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present.
▪ When more than one celebration is scheduled in the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination between congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby, entryway, public sidewalks, and parking lot.

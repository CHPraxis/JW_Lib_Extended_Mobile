<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ Is it appropriate to contribute for transportation that is provided by others?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some of us have circumstances that require us to depend on others for assistance in regularly attending the meetings and sharing in field service. Many brothers and sisters kindly go out of their way and lovingly use their time, vehicles, and other resources to provide transportation for us. Although they may have to get ready earlier than they would otherwise and they are delayed in returning home, they provide the transportation with a willing spirit.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As in every other aspect of our Christian ministry, the principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a> applies: “Each one will carry his own load.” Therefore, if someone regularly provides transportation for us, we should show our appreciation not only by our words but also, if we possibly can, by a reasonable contribution to help care for the expenses involved.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Even if the person who is using his vehicle does not ask for financial assistance and does not appear to be in need of such, the sincere offer of a contribution is always appreciated. The driver may decline to accept anything; and, of course, that should be a decision for him to make. But it is proper for you to make the offer. If you are unable to contribute anything at the moment, you can keep it in mind; you may be able to offer something extra the next time you accept a ride.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:38-42:6:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 6:38</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is very loving for those who have vehicles to provide transportation for others who might otherwise be unable to attend meetings or share in the field ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 3:27</a>) At the same time, it is also loving for those who benefit from such kindness to express their thanks by contributing in accord with their circumstances.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 3:15</a>.</p>

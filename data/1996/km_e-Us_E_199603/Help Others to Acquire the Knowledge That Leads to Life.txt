Help Others to Acquire the Knowledge That Leads to Life
1 The apostle Paul explained that it is ‘God’s will that all sorts of men should come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.’ (1 Tim. 2:4) How can we help others to take in that knowledge? One way is by making return visits on persons whose interest has been aroused by means of the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. This publication presents Bible truth in clear, simple, well-chosen words. By studying it, people of all sorts can be led to life. What can we say that will encourage others to study it with us?
2 For those who showed an interest in the Bible as a practical guide, you could return to offer a study, perhaps saying:
▪ “When I was here before, we discussed why we can trust the Bible as a practical source of guidance. Because of its being inspired by God, the Bible is also a sure source of comfort and hope, even as one of Christ’s apostles stated. [Read Romans 15:4.] At the end of our last conversation, I raised the question, How can we personally benefit from the knowledge contained in the Bible?” Read paragraph 18 on page 11 in the Knowledge book. Point out that Jehovah’s Witnesses are conducting some five million Bible studies worldwide, helping people everywhere to take in the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. Offer a brief demonstration of how a study is conducted, using the first five paragraphs in chapter 1.
3 If prayer was the topic you initially discussed with someone, you might try this approach in an effort to start a study:
▪ “I hope you enjoyed the information about prayer that we discussed from the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. I promised to come back and consider with you how those who pray to God can, in turn, listen to him. Notice what is stated on page 158. [Read paragraph 18.] Thus, by personally studying the Bible, we are listening to what God has to say to us. Doing that draws us closer to him and helps us to deal with the day-to-day problems about which we pray. It would be my pleasure to study the Bible with you.” If the person is willing, begin with the first chapter of the Knowledge book.
4 If you used the direct approach to start a study, you might say this to follow up the initial discussion:
▪ “I made a special effort to stop by again because I wanted to tell you more about our free Bible study program. I left with you a copy of this book, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, which is the study aid that we use. Notice how it encourages us to consider God’s Word. [Read paragraph 23 on page 22.] If you would please get your copy of the book, perhaps we can continue studying where we left off the last time.” If a study was not started on the initial call, you might say: “Perhaps this would be a good time for me to demonstrate how we study the Bible.” After considering a few paragraphs, arrange a definite time to return for the next study.
5 Using the Knowledge book effectively will enable us to spread about accurate knowledge for the blessing of others. (Prov. 15:7) Such knowledge will bring delight to those whose hearts are right, and it will be a powerful incentive for them to live in harmony with Jehovah’s righteousness, leading eventually to everlasting life.

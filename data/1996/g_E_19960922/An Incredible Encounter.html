<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE most exciting thing I have ever done in my life!” That is how Kristie described her incredible encounter. Is this how you would have felt if you had been able to swim with dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Everyone gets a thrill out of seeing dolphins swim or perform aquatic feats, such as walking backward on their tails, leaping from the water to astonishing heights, or allowing humans to ride them. Just watching these shows can make a person want to get into the water and play with those dolphins.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Kristie had always felt this way. Then one day, while she was boating and swimming in the Gulf of Mexico, a head suddenly popped up in front of her. In time, it seemed that three curious dolphins thought they had found a playmate. At first, Kristie was a little frightened, but then her fear turned into excitement as she interacted with the dolphins. Leaving them in charge of the situation, she settled back to see what they would do next.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Kristie said: “A dolphin would just pop up in front of me—and there we were, looking at each other. I found myself petting it and talking to it—just the way I would to my dog.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of dolphins’ intelligence, they are popular entertainers, and most trainers say that because of their friendliness toward people, dolphins do not always have to be bribed with food to perform their tricks.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When asked what the most enjoyable thing about working with dolphins is, Liz Morris, an animal behaviorist at Sea World in Florida, U.S.A., said: “I think it’s their nature. Because they are so playful and curious by nature, you can really develop a rapport with them . . . They respond very well to touch and affection.” In God’s promised new system of things, all of us will be able to have many incredible encounters like Kristie’s.</p>

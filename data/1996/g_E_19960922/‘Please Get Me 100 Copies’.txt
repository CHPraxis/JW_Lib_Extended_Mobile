‘Please Get Me 100 Copies’
Hildegard, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses who lives in Germany, gave her gynecologist a copy of the February 22, 1995, Awake! The magazine contained a series of articles entitled “A Better Understanding of Menopause.”
Later, when Hildegard’s daughter visited the same doctor, she discovered that he had read the articles. He requested: “Please ask your mother if she can get me a hundred copies.”
When the magazines were delivered, the doctor said: “Don’t get the idea that I am becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. But these articles about menopause are written so positively that my patients ought to read them.”
Shortly afterward, Hildegard heard that the magazine had been well received by his patients. In fact, one woman said that she had not only enjoyed the articles on menopause but the other articles in the magazine as well. So Hildegard phoned her doctor’s office to ask if further copies were needed. “Could we have another hundred?” asked the assistant.

“In Search of the Greatest Artist”
That was the title carried by the Awake! of November 8, 1995. The subject brought a favorable reaction from readers all over the world.
Amang wrote from Douala, Cameroon: “The articles had quite an effect on me because I love art, especially fine paintings. Now I appreciate that there is an Artist greater than Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Da Vinci, and others—none other than Jehovah God himself.”
From St. Barthélemy, in the French West Indies, Frederick said: “I read it four times, and each time I was filled with gratitude for the beautiful things our Creator gave us.”
Assunta wrote from Italy: “It aroused in me the desire to paint. It deepened my enthusiasm for God’s new world.” And Irena, from the Czech Republic, said: “When we visit museums, we have to pay to see works of art, whereas the Creator of all natural beauty offers it to us gratis, every day.” Aline wrote from Brazil: “Although we frequently have articles to help us appreciate Jehovah’s personality, these touched my heart. They gave many details about creation that enhance our appreciation of Jehovah’s love.”
From the winter cold of Wisconsin, U.S.A., Anne wrote: “It really helped me appreciate the beauty of creation. Sometimes in winter it’s hard to find. The same day I read the article, I went outside and noted the frost on a branch, a snow-covered leaf, animal tracks in the snow. Thank you again for the reminder of how we can appreciate ‘the Greatest Artist.’”

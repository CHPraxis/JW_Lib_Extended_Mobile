Where Do They Get Their Strength?
IF YOU take a close look at the butterfly in this photo, you will see that one of its four wings is completely useless. Yet, the butterfly continues feeding and flying. This is not an isolated case. Butterflies have been observed going about their daily activity with 70 percent of their wing surfaces missing.
Similarly, many people display a resolute spirit. Despite suffering from severe physical or emotional problems, they do not give up.—Compare 2 Corinthians 4:16.
The apostle Paul personally endured great hardships during the course of his missionary journeys. He was flogged, beaten, stoned, and imprisoned. Additionally, he suffered some form of disability, perhaps a problem with his eyes, that was a constant “thorn in the flesh” to him.—2 Corinthians 12:7-9; Galatians 4:15.
A Christian elder named David, who fought severe bouts of depression for several years, believes that Jehovah’s strength was crucial to his recovery. “Time and again, hard-won progress seemed to be slipping away,” he explains. “In the face of such discouragement, I threw myself on Jehovah, and he truly sustained me. There were occasions when I prayed for hours at a time. When I spoke to Jehovah, my feelings of loneliness and uselessness disappeared. I have struggled through periods of great weakness, but thanks to Jehovah, out of this weakness has come strength—even the strength to help others.”
Jehovah God strengthened Paul. Therefore, he could say: “When I am weak, then I am powerful.” (2 Corinthians 12:10) Yes, Paul’s weaknesses taught him to rely on God-given strength. “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me,” said the apostle. (Philippians 4:13) Jehovah certainly does empower his servants.

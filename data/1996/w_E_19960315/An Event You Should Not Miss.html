<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Every good gift and every perfect present” comes down from God, our heavenly Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) The greatest gift that God has given to fallen mankind is the provision for their recovery by means of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus’ death as our Ransomer makes possible everlasting life on a paradise earth. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>, we are commanded to memorialize his death.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to share with them in heeding Jesus’ command. This annual observance will take place after sundown on the date corresponding to Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar, which will be Tuesday, April 2, 1996. Make a note of this date so that you will not forget it. Jehovah’s Witnesses in your locality can tell you the exact meeting place and time.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah is the greatest example of one who manifests genuine care for others. As the Universal Sovereign, he is sensitive to the needs of his human creation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7</a>) Jesus encouraged his followers to manifest the traits of his Father, who makes the sun rise and the rain fall upon righteous and unrighteous people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 5:45</a>) You can imitate Jehovah by showing genuine concern for others—being prepared to share the Kingdom message with everyone you meet. By being thoroughly familiar with the brochures that will be used in the ministry during July, you will be in a good position to offer spiritual assistance to others. The following suggestions offer some ideas as to how you may prepare for the initial call and then follow up interest with timely return visits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Have you ever wondered why God permits humans to suffer if he really cares about them? [Allow for response.] This brochure not only provides the satisfying answer to this question but also shows that God has promised to undo all the damage man has brought upon himself and his earthly home.” Read paragraph 23 on page 27. Show the illustration below it, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 145:16</a> from paragraph 22. Offer the brochure. If it is accepted, ask a question that can be answered on the next visit, such as: “Would you like to know <em>how </em>God will accomplish his purpose of bringing blessings to mankind and transforming the earth into a paradise?” Be sure to mention that our worldwide work is supported by voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When returning to those with whom you placed the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you might get another discussion started this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “When I called last time, we considered that God does indeed care for us and that it is his purpose to undo all the damage man has brought upon himself and his earthly home.” Open the brochure to the illustration on pages 2-3 and say: “We ended our conversation with the question, How will God accomplish his purpose of bringing blessings to mankind and transforming the earth into a paradise? What do you think?” Allow for response. Turn to page 17, and read paragraph 2 and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>. Thereafter, read paragraph 12 on page 18. Ask householder if he would like to consider with you part 9 of the brochure. If he would, study it with him.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Here is an approach that might be used in offering the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies.” Show its cover and say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Today we are sharing this brochure that has brought comfort and hope to millions of people who have lost loved ones in death. Have you ever wondered what hope there is for the dead? [Allow for response.] The Bible clearly states God’s promise of a resurrection.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>. Open the brochure and comment on the points made in the last paragraph on page 28 and the first paragraph on page 31. Show the accompanying illustrations. Offer the brochure. You can prepare the way for a return visit by asking, “How can we be sure that eventually death will be completely eliminated?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Where you placed the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies,” you may want to use this presentation on the return visit:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “When we spoke before, we discussed the wonderful hope of a resurrection. The brochure I left you explains why we can be sure that eventually death will be completely eliminated. Did you not find God’s promises comforting and reassuring?” Allow for response. Then turn to page 31 in the brochure, and read the second and third paragraphs, along with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. Highlight the prospect we have of enjoying life without ever dying. Depending on the interest shown and the circumstances at the moment, you may offer a Bible study in the <em>Knowledge </em>book or ask another question to open the way for the next return visit.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>You might say the following when presenting the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?”:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">▪ “Many people have wondered what the purpose of life is. They’ve asked themselves: ‘Why am I here? Where am I going? What does the future hold for me?’ Where do you think we can find the answers? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.] Is it not reasonable to conclude that man’s Creator is in the best position to explain why we are here? [Allow for response.] This brochure shows the grand purpose that God has in store for us.” Turn to pages 20-1, read the caption, and comment on the illustration; then offer the brochure. If accepted, ask: “How can we be sure it is still God’s purpose for humans to live forever in Paradise on earth?” Explain the donation arrangement. Set up a time to return.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>If the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?” is placed, you could say something like this when you return:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">▪ “On my previous visit, I really enjoyed discussing with you the Bible’s view that human life really does have a purpose.” Show the illustration on page 31 and ask, “How can we be sure it is still God’s will that humans are to live forever in Paradise on earth?” Read paragraph 3 on page 20. Discuss points under the subheading, “Still God’s Purpose,” on page 21. Turn to the back cover of the brochure, and read about the offer of a free home Bible study. Introduce the <em>Knowledge </em>book, and offer to demonstrate how we use it as an aid to study the Bible.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Our ministry should reflect the sincere interest that we have in helping honesthearted ones to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) Therefore, make time in your service schedule to call back on each person with whom you place a brochure. Your manifesting real concern for them may result in helping those who are sighing and groaning over the detestable things practiced in false religion to become identified for survival. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:6-26:9:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6</a>) You will also experience the joy and satisfaction that come from knowing you are imitating Jehovah by genuinely caring for others.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:20-50:2:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 2:20</a>.</p>

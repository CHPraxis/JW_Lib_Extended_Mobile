New Circuit Assembly Program
1 The new circuit assembly program beginning in September will develop the theme “Experience the Greater Happiness in Giving.” (Acts 20:35) Happiness is described as “a state of well-being and contentment.” Most people today snatch whatever pleasure they can from life, and when they do, it often is temporary. That is not true happiness. Yet, Jehovah teaches us how to benefit ourselves forever. (Isa. 48:17; 1 John 2:17) The new circuit assembly program will emphasize how we can gain greater happiness by giving in a spiritual way.
2 We will learn practical ways in which we can give of ourselves in the ministry. Some of the talks to be given by the traveling overseers are entitled: “Making Friends by Means of Unrighteous Riches,” “Respect Divine Provision of ‘Gifts in Men,’” and “Experience the Many Facets of True Happiness.” Those desiring to be baptized at the assembly will want to speak to the presiding overseer so that he can arrange for elders to review baptismal questions with them. Serving Jehovah in a clean relationship will bring great happiness to the newly baptized ones.
3 Proper recognition of Jehovah’s authority also brings true happiness and security. All people need to know this. Hence, the public address at the circuit assembly will develop the theme “Unite With God’s Happy People.” Be sure to invite all those who have shown an interest in the truth to come to this talk. They have not found genuine security and lasting happiness under human rule in this world, which is lying in Satan’s power. (Eccl. 8:9) But what joy they will find in being associated with Jehovah’s happy people!—Ps. 144:15b.
4 Despite worsening conditions in this system of things, those who experience the greater happiness in giving spiritually will never be disappointed by the happy God. (1 Tim. 1:11) The new circuit assembly program will demonstrate this to be true. Do not miss it!

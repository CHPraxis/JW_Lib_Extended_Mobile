<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Bible sometimes uses the lion as a symbol of courage and confidence. Valiant or courageous men are described as having “the heart of the lion,” and the righteous are said to be “like a young lion that is confident.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:10-10:17:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 17:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:1-20:28:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Proverbs 28:1</a>) Especially when challenged, the lion shows it deserves its reputation as “the mightiest among the beasts.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:30-20:30:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is to the lion’s fearlessness that Jehovah God likens his determination to protect his people. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:4-23:31:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:4, 5</a> states: “Just as the lion growls, even the maned young lion, over its prey, when there is called out against it a full number of shepherds, and in spite of their voice he will not be terrified and in spite of their commotion he will not stoop; in the same way Jehovah of armies will come down to wage war over Mount Zion . . . Defending her, he will also certainly deliver her. Sparing her, he must also cause her to escape.” Jehovah thus assures his servants of his active care, particularly in the face of adversity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible compares mankind’s greatest adversary, Satan the Devil, to a roaring, ravenous lion. To avoid becoming his prey, we are told in the Scriptures: “Keep your senses, be watchful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) One way to do this is to avoid fatal spiritual drowsiness. In this regard Jesus said: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 21:34-36</a>) Yes, being spiritually awake in these “last days” can give us “the heart of the lion,” one that is ‘steadfast, reliant on Jehovah.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:112:7-19:112:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Psalm 112:7, 8</a>.</p>

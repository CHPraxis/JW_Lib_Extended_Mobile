<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MODERN research indicates that “fetuses have physiological reactions to voices.” University of North Carolina researchers “found that after mothers read to their children in utero, the newborns reacted when the passages were read again,” says the <em>Winnipeg Free Press. </em>When women read aloud while pregnant, this may well contribute to instilling good moral values in the child. The Bible says that Timothy ‘knew the holy writings from infancy.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:14, 15</a>) Evidently, his mother and his grandmother appreciated the value of training him from infancy, which very likely included reading aloud.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Reading is “the most powerful life skill that we have in our society today,” says author Jim Trelease. Language and vocabulary skills are enhanced by reading aloud.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is wise to begin reading aloud at least as soon as you start to talk to your infant. Even though your unborn or newborn child will not initially understand what you are saying, the potential long-term benefits are worth it. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a> says: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What can you read that is both practical and beneficial? Read the Bible aloud to your child each day. Also read other worthwhile publications, such as <em>Listening to the Great Teacher, My Book of Bible Stories, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>and articles in the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">True, giving of yourself in this way involves time, but it is time well spent. It is a tangible way to show that you care about and love your child.</p>

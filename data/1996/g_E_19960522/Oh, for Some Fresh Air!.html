<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN you breathe, do you inhale fresh air? Present-day air pollution is “a bigger enemy than smoking,” claims a doctor quoted in <em>The Times </em>of London. In England and in Wales, contaminated air kills an estimated 10,000 people every year. Worldwide, especially in large cities, the situation is serious.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many blame the automobile industry for polluting the atmosphere. To reduce dangerous exhaust, new vehicles in many countries now come fitted with catalytic converters, which reduce pollution. The hydrocarbons in exhaust gases have dropped to 12 percent of the 1970 levels, with similar reductions of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Babies in strollers are particularly vulnerable because they ride at the level that cars spew out fumes. But air pollution threatens car occupants as well. Reportedly, the contamination is three times higher inside cars than outside. Further hazards come from inhaling benzene fumes from fuel as you fill your car’s fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Now the most prevalent form of air pollution worldwide is “Suspended Particulate Matter,” says a 1993-94 United Nations environmental data report. Apparently, tiny bits of soot, or particulate matter, have the ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and there deposit damaging chemicals.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The depletion of the ozone layer high above the globe attracts much press comment. At ground level, however, sunlight acts on the nitrogen oxides and other volatile elements of air pollution to produce high levels of ozone. These levels have doubled in Britain during this century. These gases damage paint and other building materials, cause disease in trees, plants, and crops, and appear to trigger respiratory problems in some people. Although most of the ozone pollution occurs in towns, surprisingly it is the rural areas that suffer the worst effects. In the urban areas, nitrogen oxides mop up the excess ozone, but where these oxides are sparse, the ozone has free rein to wreak damage.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Additionally, air pollution is “up to 70 times higher inside homes than outdoors,” reports <em>The Times. </em>Here the fumes from air fresheners, mothballs, and even dry-cleaned clothes pollute the air. Cigarette smoke likewise adds to health risks indoors.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What, then, can you do to protect your family? <em>The Times </em>of London offered the following suggestions.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">• Reduce your use of the car. If possible, share transportation with others. Drive smoothly. If stuck in a traffic jam or otherwise stationary for more than a couple of minutes, switch off the engine. If possible, on hot days park your car in the shade to reduce pollution produced by fuel evaporation.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">• Choose to exercise in the early mornings when ozone levels outdoors are generally low.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">• Outlaw smoking in the home.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">• Keep bedroom windows slightly open at night to lower humidity and move allergens outside.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">No doubt you agree: Oh, for some fresh air!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WORLDWIDE, Jehovah’s Witnesses are conducting nearly five million home Bible studies with people who are interested in gaining accurate knowledge about God and his wonderful purpose for mankind. Even children among Jehovah’s Witnesses are having a share in this work. Consider, for example, a boy named Joel. He symbolized his dedication to Jehovah and was baptized at nine years of age. A year later he had this experience:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“While in the ministry, I met a woman named Candy. I offered her the brochure <em>‘Look! I Am Making All Things New.’ </em>She already had it, so I offered her the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>She already had that too. Then I thought, ‘I’ll offer this woman a Bible study.’ She accepted!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Candy’s sister, who was dying of cancer, came to live with her. Additionally, Candy was studying to be a nurse. So for a period of time, the Bible study was discontinued. But my parents and I kept in contact with her by leaving the magazines with her or her husband, Dick. He told us that she kept the magazines by her bed and would read them at night.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Eventually, Candy’s sister died. My Dad and Mom and I spoke with Candy about the condition of the dead. She decided to resume her Bible study. On a different day, we asked Dick if he would like to study along with Candy and make it a family study. He thought that was a good idea. So now, along with my Dad, I am studying with both Dick and Candy. They are making fine progress and express appreciation for the Bible study.</p>

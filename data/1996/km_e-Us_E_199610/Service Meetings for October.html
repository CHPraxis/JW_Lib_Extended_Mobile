It covers the fundamental Bible subjects and principles new ones need to understand before they get baptized. If we keep the study moving at a good pace, the student can make rapid progress. Discuss and demonstrate how to start a study by using the direct approach: Review picture and caption on pages 4-5; explain our study method; briefly discuss the first five paragraphs in chapter 1; make an appointment to return later and continue the discussion, answering the question, Is everlasting life only a dream? Emphasize the joy that comes with the privilege of conducting a home Bible study.</p>

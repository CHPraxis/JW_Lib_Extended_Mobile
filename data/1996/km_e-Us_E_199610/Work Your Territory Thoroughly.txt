Work Your Territory Thoroughly
1 In residential areas we occasionally encounter a small business place, such as a grocery store, restaurant, or retail shop. If these establishments are to be covered along with the rest of this territory, you should call on them the same as the residences.
2 You can use a simple, brief presentation, perhaps saying: “I have something I would like to show you.” If the proprietor seems to be busy at the moment, you might just offer a tract and say: “I will stop by again when you are not so busy. I would like to know what you think of this.”
3 There is no need to feel apprehensive about doing this work. One publisher reported: “I expected that the response would be negative. However, to my surprise, the reaction to the Kingdom message was just the opposite. They were genuinely polite and friendly and almost always accepted the magazines.”
4 A woman working at a real-estate company invited the Witnesses into her office. She accepted the magazines and expressed interest in having a Bible study. She was shown the Knowledge book, and a study was started on the spot, right in her office!
5 The assignment to work your territory thoroughly includes calling on individuals who operate neighborhood businesses. (Acts 10:42) Plan to call at these doors just the same as at private homes. Not only will this give better coverage to your territory but you may be rewarded with some delightful experiences!

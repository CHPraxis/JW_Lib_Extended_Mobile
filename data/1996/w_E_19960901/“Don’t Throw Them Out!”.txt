“Don’t Throw Them Out!”
“IF ONE of Jehovah’s Witnesses, or even two, should ring your doorbell, don’t throw them out!” advises Corriere della Sera. The newspaper was referring to an episode that took place in Treviso, northern Italy, in which a businessman risked losing over a million lire (more than $600, U.S.) because of turning away two Witnesses who paid him a visit.
According to the newspaper, two Witnesses introduced themselves to the man with the words: “Today is a good day for you. We are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and we have something valuable to give you.” At that, the ill-disposed businessman shut the door, not allowing them to finish.
If the man had listened, he would have learned that the Witnesses had gone to his home to return his wallet, which they found on a park bench. So the Witnesses were able to do no more than take the wallet with its contents to the nearest police station. The following day, the police returned it to its rightful owner.
“If someone else had been in the shoes of the two unfortunate [Witnesses],” said Il Gazzettino di Treviso, “he would probably have . . . kept the wallet’s considerable contents. But not Jehovah’s Witnesses, who must be completely honest.”
What moves Jehovah’s Witnesses to be “completely honest”? It is their love for God and for neighbor, in accord with the teachings of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 22:37-39) That is also why Jehovah’s Witnesses go from house to house to declare the good news about the marvelous “new earth” promised by Jehovah God. Such a message of hope is worth far more than any material possession!—2 Peter 3:13.

“It Is the Work of Jehovah”
That was the title of an article in El Norte, a newspaper of Monterrey City, Mexico. The article was about a new Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Monterrey is a city with a population of 2,300,000 (including the suburbs) in the northern part of Mexico, and it has 19,200 Kingdom publishers. For about a year and a half, the Witnesses united their efforts to build a beautiful and practical Assembly Hall with 3,000 comfortable seats and air conditioning. The local Witnesses rejoiced when a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses presented the dedication talk. The program included a brief history of the work in Monterrey, and there were interviews with those who took part in the construction. Then the 4,500 attending the meeting enjoyed the dedication talk.
This is the third of the recent Assembly Halls that have been constructed in Mexico in what has been described as a campaign for “More, Larger, and Better Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.”
With more than 443,000 publishers in Mexico, and with an attendance of 1,492,500 at the Memorial in 1995, new Assembly Halls, such as the one in Monterrey, certainly will serve the divine purpose.

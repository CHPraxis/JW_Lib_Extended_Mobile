<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT does the Bible really say about Mary, the mother of Jesus? Most believers in Christendom hold to the teaching that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God and yet that they are not three gods, but three in one. In other words, the Trinity. For large portions of Christendom (Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox), this teaching logically gave birth to the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is therefore the “Mother of God.” Is that really so? How did Jesus view his mother? How did the disciples view her? Let us see how the Bible answers:</p>

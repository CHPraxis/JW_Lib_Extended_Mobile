‘Every Person on Earth Should Read This Publication’
A READER from Alabama, U.S.A., expressed heartfelt appreciation for Awake! and wrote:
“I have just finished reading a back issue of the Awake! magazine, entitled “Victorious in the Face of Death.” (May 8, 1993) I could not lay it down. It was informative, factual, educational.
“I think every person on earth should have the opportunity to read this publication!”
Awake! is published in 78 languages for the enlightenment of others. Its articles discuss religion and science, as well as the social, emotional, and family issues that are on the minds of many people.
If you would like to receive Awake! or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the value of Bible education with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or the address nearest you listed on page 5.

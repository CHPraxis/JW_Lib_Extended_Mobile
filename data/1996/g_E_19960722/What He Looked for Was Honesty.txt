What He Looked for Was Honesty
A young woman in Ecuador went for a job interview. After conversing with other candidates—altogether there were 36—she realized her chances were slim. They had job experience and a university education, whereas she had neither. And of the six questions asked, she answered two incorrectly. One question, however, was of a personal nature: “What is truth for you?”
The woman answered: “Truth is not an abstract concept but something we should live. We should speak truth and not lie, for if we lie, we put ourselves in the company of Satan the Devil. If we speak the truth, we please God and gain many personal benefits.”
When the manager asked the woman’s religion, she replied that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The following day she was informed that she had been chosen for the job. A month later the woman asked the manager why he had selected her, and he said it was because of her honesty.
Isn’t it true that many people today are dishonest? On the other hand, people who respect the Bible are noted for their honesty. The Watchtower of July 1, 1995, said: “In the Bible, ‘truth’ is not at all like the abstract, intangible concept over which philosophers debate.”

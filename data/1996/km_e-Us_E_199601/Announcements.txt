Announcements
▪ Literature offer for January: Making Your Family Life Happy, Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace,” or True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It? Congregations that have on hand any 192-page books published prior to 1982 should offer such books first. February: Either Making Your Family Life Happy or Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand! March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. April: Individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! For territory that is covered frequently, any brochure (except the Education and School brochures) may also be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).
▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Tuesday, April 2, after sundown. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested people find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or enjoy a general interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.
▪ The special public talk for the 1996 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 21. The subject of the talk will be “Remaining Blameless Amid a Crooked Generation.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 21.
▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 3, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “A Loyal Congregation Under Christ’s Leadership.”
▪ New Videocassettes Available:
Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life (Volume 1, chapters 1-3)—American Sign Language
The Bible—Accurate History, Reliable Prophecy—Korean

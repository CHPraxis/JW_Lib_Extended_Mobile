<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It is God’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) What can we do to help? Make return visits with the objective of teaching the truth. What will you say? The following suggestions may help you.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When calling on someone who accepted the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” you might refer again to the illustration on page 4 and ask the householder:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “After further examining the book I left with you and thinking on God’s promise of a paradise earth, how do you feel about these marvelous promises God has made for mankind?” After acknowledging the householder’s response and commenting briefly on it, you may call attention to chapters 2 and 3 and suggest considering why man’s efforts toward peace and security, including those of a religious nature, have failed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you left the householder wondering what the reason is for God’s toleration of wickedness, on your return you might resume the discussion by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “I enjoyed our conversation when we first met, and I wanted to return to see how you felt about the reason for God’s putting up with the unrest and violence that exist in the world today. [Allow for response. Turn to and read <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986035/30-30">paragraph 25 on page 54 in the <em>True Peace</em></a> book, including the quotation from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:8-61:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:8, 9</a>.] Notice that the next chapter in the book asks, ‘What Has God Been Doing?’ Perhaps we can discuss the answer to that question on my next visit.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You might follow up the placement of the book “Making Your Family Life Happy” with this approach:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “When I first visited with you, I was impressed by your concern for your family. Living as we do in the last days of a wicked system of things, it is vital for families to keep preparing for the future. To that end, the book that I left with you, <em>Making Your Family Life Happy, </em>strongly recommends the having of regular Bible discussions in the home. [Read paragraph 10 on pages 185-6.] If I may, I’d like to take just a few minutes to demonstrate how people in some 200 lands discuss the Bible at home as family groups.” As time allows, use the material under the subheading on page 71 to demonstrate the study.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You could follow up the placement of the “Worldwide Security” book by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “I wanted to come back to show you more about God’s purpose for this earth.” Turn to the illustration on pages 172-3, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>, and then briefly explain how God’s Kingdom will fulfill this promise. Offer a free home Bible study.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Remember that the goal in making return visits is to start Bible studies. The new book, <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, </em>is especially designed for conducting studies. When we follow up on the placement of older books and actually start a study, it would be good to direct attention to this new book. We will find much joy as those who study learn to call upon Jehovah for salvation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:21-44:2:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>To have insight requires that we understand something about the people to whom we preach. Why? Because our success in reaching people’s hearts depends on our ability to present the Kingdom message in a manner that appeals to them. During the month of January, we will be offering a variety of Bible study books that the congregation may still have on hand. Otherwise, publishers will use the book <em>True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It? </em>The following suggestions may be helpful.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If you choose to offer the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” you could refer to the illustration on page 4 and say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “This illustration is an artist’s conception of what the Bible teaches about God’s purpose for the earth. What do you think it would require for you and your family to live in a paradise earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows that true peace and security will soon be a reality earth wide and that Paradise will be restored. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>.] This book can show you what you need to do to benefit from what God will do. I’d like to leave this copy with you.” If there is a favorable response, you may briefly explain the donation arrangement.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When you are using the book “Making Your Family Life Happy,” you might say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Would you agree that the modern family faces challenges that were unknown to previous generations? [Allow for response.] Why, in your opinion, is this happening? [Acknowledge response. Turn to and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a>.] The phrases ‘disobedient to parents’ and ‘having no natural affection’ accurately describe many in our day. However, the same God who predicted these problems has also given us sound guidance on how to draw a family closer together.” Read the paragraph from “The Publishers” on page 2. Offer the book without charge, and then mention the donation arrangement.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Another approach that might be used with the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” begins with this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Many people today believe that God is not really interested in us humans on the earth and that he is not going to do anything about the problems that exist here. Is that how you feel? [Allow for response.] Let me read to you what this Bible study aid has to say about God’s intent toward man and the earth. [Read paragraph 1 and the first sentence of paragraph 2 on page 43.] I assure you, there is a sound reason for God’s toleration of the problems that exist on the earth. If you would like to learn what it is, please read this book, which is entitled <em>True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” </em>If the householder promises to read the book, leave it and mention the donation arrangement.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>If you would like to make a brief presentation using the book “Worldwide Security Under the ‘Prince of Peace,’” you could open the book to page 4 and ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “What is to become of planet Earth? Many wonder about this. Do you think it will ever become a paradise?” Acknowledge householder’s response, and then read the opening remarks on page 2. Offer to leave the book, and explain the donation arrangement.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Good insight will enable us to discern the needs and interests of the people we meet. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:23-20:16:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:23</a> assures us of this, saying: “The heart of the wise one causes his mouth to show insight, and to his lips it adds persuasiveness.”</p>

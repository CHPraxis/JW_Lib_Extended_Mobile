Do You Thirst for Bible Knowledge?
FOR decades free discussion of the Bible was prohibited in Communist lands. But with the end of the Cold War, hundreds of thousands of people there have begun seeking Bible knowledge. While this is occurring especially in republics of the former Soviet Union, the situation is similar in Eastern European countries.
For example, a discussion of the Bible brought great joy to a 45-year-old biology and chemistry teacher in Pecs, Hungary. “It was a thrilling and joyful experience to talk with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses when I visited Budapest,” the teacher wrote. “I like to read the Scriptures, and I would appreciate sharing in a Bible study. I would thankfully accept your help.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are delighted to provide such help to people everywhere. If you would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

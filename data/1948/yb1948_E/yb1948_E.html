<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1948 YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH God is the great Life-giver. Even the short span of life that we enjoy now is a gift from Jehovah God. It is only by his grace that we exist and are able to move about in the earth and make expression of our thoughts to others and to do the work that we do. Man should appreciate what God has done for him, but, unfortunately, the majority of men do not know God and little do they try to find out anything about him. Man is self-satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are now acting as Jehovah’s witnesses have an appreciation of Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth. They know he created man from the ground and placed him upon the earth and that man was instructed to subdue it and bring it to a perfect, beautiful state as well as to multiply and fill it with his kind. (Gen. 1:28) The servant of Jehovah God knows that he gave man life and that in his due time men of good-will are to receive power and authority to do this grand work of beautifying the earth and populating it under the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses further recognize that to maintain this gift of life and the privileges that go with it they must always honor their Creator and bring praise to him. However, men of this wicked world choose to be fools (Ps. 14:1) and they ignore God, his wisdom, his works, and his almighty power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul had mankind pretty well sized up in his day, and since Paul’s day man has not improved in knowledge of the Supreme One down to the present time, but he continues on in his selfish</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font2">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">way and continues to try to suppress the truth. Paul set forth in his epistle to the Romans (1:18-23) the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For God’s anger is breaking forth from heaven against all the impiety and wickedness of the men who in their wickedness are suppressing the truth. For all that can be known of God is clearly before them; God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible nature—his eternal power and divine [person]—have been clearly perceptible through what he has made. So they have no excuse, for, though they knew God, they have not honored him as God or given thanks to him, but they have indulged in futile speculations, until their stupid minds have become dark. They called themselves wise, but they have turned into fools, and for the splendor of the immortal God they have substituted images in the form of mortal man, birds, animals, and reptiles.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today men generally are of the same mind as the people that lived under the Roman rule in Paul’s day. The rulers have not changed, neither have the people, in this respect. The rulers of the Roman Empire pushed God out of the picture for their concept of “one world” and forgot that God created the earth; they forgot that even the little life they had, the short existence being enjoyed by men then, was only by God’s grace. Then the big idea was the Roman Empire under Caesar. Today it is the “one world” under the United Nations; but today as then the selfishness, greed, and idol-worship remain the same, if not worsened. In the days of the Lord Jesus Christ it was an all-out support for the sprawling Roman Government that was demanded. Jesus was willing to render to Caesar of Rome the tilings that were Caesar’s, but that could go to only a certain extent. There was something else in the Scriptures upon this issue for the people to consider, namely: “And [render] unto God the things that are God’s.” (Matt. 22:21) Rendering to Caesar the things that were his was all right as far as it went; but the doing of this could not rightly interfere with the proper worship, the true worship of Jehovah God the Life-giver. They killed Jesus because he did not go all-out for the Roman government and because he held to preaching the kingdom of God as the only hope for humankind and because he held to giving praise to God, which praise rightly belonged to his Father in heaven. So they killed Jesus because he was different from this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, now, will you do, Mr. Reader? Will you be like the men Paul described and “indulge in futile speculation” such as the delegates to the United Nations do, putting your trust in men, politics, militarism, religion and images? or will you be different and follow Jesus’ counsel and keep God in mind and serve him? Will you also render to God that which is God’s? Jehovah’s witnesses choose to be different; nay, more, they are under obligation to God to be different. They recognize Jehovah as the only true Sovereign worthy of praise and render to him all that is due to him as their Father in heaven. They fully appreciate that Satan the Devil is the “god of this world” and that he is determined to try holding on to his power which gave him the opportunity, for a time, to be the mighty invisible ruler of this world. (2 Cor. 4:4; John 14:30) It was back in the garden of Eden that Satan turned man against God through deceptive promises that he made to man, saying that man would be like God, knowing good and evil. Adam was selfish, and he rebelled against God. He disobeyed God’s plain statements that would have led to life, and became the worshiper of a demon, as the Scriptures say the Devil is. “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.” (1 Sam. 15:23) Adam no longer looked to his Father in heaven as the great Life-giver to whom he owed everything. Because he was still alive after sinning against God, he may have thought he would be able to maintain his life. He idolized himself or worshiped himself, for this is indicated by the stubborn course of action he took in disobeying God. The Lord’s Word sets forth the principle, “Stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From that time on stubborn man has substituted images in the form of mortal men, birds, animals and reptiles, to which to give his worship. Man thinks a lot of himself, and he thinks he is able to do something that God alone says He will do. Men think they can set up a human organization, the United Nations, as the only hope for world peace and prosperity, and by so doing they ignore God’s kingdom, for which Christians have been taught to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is done in heaven.” Man, under the rule of Satan the Devil, “the god of this world,” has indeed become a stubborn creature, so that now the heads of the governments of this world, of all the nations and their peoples, come to worship a United Nations, a form of world government. They want all the commercial organizations, all the political organizations, all the religious organizations, everything in society, labor, culture, science, yes, all of them, to support and become part of this international creation of theirs, a United Nations organization. So man goes on indulging in futile speculation, until his stupid mind has become grossly dark. “They called themselves wise, but they have turned into fools.” The wise men of this world do not see the need of God: “the fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14:1) Such wise men no longer recognize him as the great Life-giver.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>THE PECULIAR PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">But there is a people that are different, Jehovah’s witnesses. This small group of people are looked at by the governments of the earth as an obstinate people, a people that just will not fall in line and that will not accept this man-made thing as their savior. The world, through its judges and its rulers, demands that Jehovah’s witnesses render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and more too, for they forget the rest of the command: ‘Render to God the things that are God’s.’ These witnesses, no matter under what nationality or form of government they happen to be born, always comply with the rules and regulations of that nation. They pay their taxes; they speak the language of the nation; they accept the education of the nation through its schools. They support all the laws of the land that are in full accord with God’s principles of truth and righteousness. They follow most of the customs and habits of the people. But one thing Jehovah’s witnesses cannot do, and that is, violate their conscience; and their conscience has been trained according to God’s Word, which says: “Give God what belongs to God.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because they do not violate their consciences or disobey God’s law, the governments of the earth have cast them off as a peculiar people, not orthodox, hard to deal with. Yet, all in all, they observe that they are an honest, upright people, persons of good habits and easy for their neighbors to get along with. However, being honest, upright, and loving their neighbors does not suit the rabble-rousers of the world. Preaching peace and prosperity under the kingdom of God is not supporting or being part of a political or religious organization. ‘If these people are left alone,’ they say, ‘the whole world will be following after them.’ The rulers of the nations then say respecting them: “Stop their talk!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1933, when Hitler came into power in Germany, Jehovah’s witnesses were doing much preaching in all parts of that land, advertising the Kingdom as the only hope of the world. They had to be stopped! So propaganda was sent forth through the government agencies that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses were Communists; they were Jews; they had to be silenced!’ They would not “heil” Hitler; they would not support the new “master race” ideas. They clung to their simple beliefs and the truths they had gained from God’s Word, the Bible. As time went on, Hitler with his supporters and idolizers moved forward to rule the world. Then the following notice was issued to all the superior officers throughout Germany: “The teaching of the Bible Researchers [Jehovah’s witnesses] represents a disguised form of Communism. The destruction of the nations of the world in the battle of Armageddon, the lifting of all national distinctions, the inauguration of Jewish legislation and Jewish dictatorship, the lifting of all racial distinctions: these are the objectives of Jewish world Bolshevism, and have absolutely nothing to do with religion! Setting up the Jewish world rule under the cloak of religious activity, that is the way the goal of the International Bible Students may best be described.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitler and his government could find no cause against Jehovah’s witnesses; so they made mischief by framing laws. (Ps. 94:20) By this means thousands were put in concentration camps. More than a thousand died in these camps, and hundreds of others were tortured and killed, because they were serving God rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the democratic countries, while the second world war was on, Jehovah’s witnesses were accused of being Nazis. In still other countries, as in Germany, they were accused of being Communists. The religionists joined in in the loud cry against Jehovah’s witnesses, and an expression typical of them is found in the religious magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Mind,</span><span class="font5"> namely: “Whatever may be the professions of Jehovah’s witnesses, there is no room for doubt that the practical effect of the Watch Tower activities is to stimulate Communism, not to say anarchy, and to undermine all feeling of reverence for authority.” From other countries, like Greece, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt, the cry comes forth that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is a promulgation &gt;&nbsp;of Jewish propaganda, and so the Greek Orthodox religious organization has recently distributed pamphlets stating that Jehovah’s witnesses are financed by Jews. On the other hand, the Jewish organization in Greece protested to the head of the Greek Catholic religious system, saying that their statement is false and that the Jews have nothing to do with Jehovah’s witnesses, nor Jehovah’s witnesses with the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While there are several thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses in Russia, hundreds of them have been sent to Siberia and put in work camps because they prefer to serve God rather than man and to proclaim a kingdom of righteousness, a new world that will be governed by a righteous overlord, Christ Jesus, and not by Communist rulers. Why should Russia treat Jehovah’s witnesses that way if they are “Communists”? It is thus seen that Jehovah’s witnesses are juggled around in every nation to suit their oppressors. The point in common is: Annihilate Jehovah’s witnesses; get rid of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us then, briefly, look at Jehovah’s witnesses of the present day and see how they view conditions in the world, and let us get their viewpoint. Who are they ? Where did they get their instructions? and why do they appear to be a different and unwanted people?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>A CLOSE-UP SCRUTINY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">These servants, who worship the Supreme One of all the universe, believe that Jehovah God alone is the Sovereign Ruler and that all worship, honor and glory are due to him. They believe he is the great Source of life and is able to save all who come to him with humble hearts. Those who have come to the Lord God and accepted his Word and abide by it are blessed of God, and they become his witnesses. And to these the Lord says, in Isaiah 43:10,11 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.) : </span><span class="font5">“Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no savior.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men and women from all parts of the world, from all nations, kindreds and tongues, have come to the Lord because of a study of his Word, and they have accepted his Word as truthful and right, and are abiding by it. They appreciate that in Isaiah 61:1-3 a commission is set out for those who consecrate themselves to serve God as followers of his Son. They know that this message which they are commissioned to preach offers comfort and hope to all nations of the earth. They know, too, that Jehovah’s chief witness, Christ Jesus, who was born a Jew and under the Mosaic law, did not compromise with the nations of the world, but stood firm for the preaching of Jehovah’s Word and of his government of righteousness that he promised to set up in the earth. At the time Jesus was on earth a call went forth for many of the Jews to enter into a new covenant with God; but when that Jewish nation did not respond, the call was extended to go on out to the ends of the earth, to the Gentiles, and God selected a people who would have the law of God written in their hearts, and whom nothing could turn away from the service of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is therefore stated, at 1 Peter 2:9,10: “But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These people of God’s mercy have become different and peculiar in the eyes of the world because they are determined, by his grace, to serve the only living and true God. They have become his chosen people. They have heralded forth his message of righteousness; and thousands upon thousands of others have heard in these last days of the Devil’s organization and have sought refuge within God’s organization. These have taken up the same call and are saying to all nations, kindreds and tongues: ‘Come, and drink of the water of life freely.’ So today, from one end of the earth to the other, there are thousands of persons that say: “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” (Ps. 57:9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.) They</span><span class="font5"> cannot sing the praises of the worldly nations, single or as United Nations, nor of any sect or religion, because all of these are exposed by God’s Word as being idolatrous. They have the Lord’s Word and in it they find God’s instruction to praise him and thus gain life everlasting. By preaching they save themselves as well as others who hear them. (1 Tim. 4:16) They receive from God his holy spirit or active force, and they go forth speaking the truth, a “pure language”, as it were.—Zeph. 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witnesses of Jehovah, who have been called from all nations, kindreds and tongues, being all of one mind, have cut through all boundaries. Language has been no barrier to their unity. Religions, politics, the ideas that men have tried to instill in the hearts of individuals, have all been cast to the winds. There is no divisive force that can stand in the way of Jehovah’s witnesses’ having one mind, which mind is the mind of Christ. Regardless of the country in which any witness of Jehovah lives, he is all-out for supporting God’s kingdom and preaching it. He is an ambassador for Christ in this respect. Being an ambassador in this old world, at the same time being no part of it, he certainly is not opposed to the present governments of the earth; nor will Jehovah’s witnesses ever try to fight against them. Nor should they fight against such governments. They have no reason to do so, for Jehovah God allows the governments to remain until he shows forth his power, and this he will do at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>NONPOLITICAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus Christ was upon the earth, he was not opposed to the Roman rule which existed over Palestine. He lived under it in that land. He complied with the regulations that existed, and he paid his taxes, too. But he was not devoted to the Roman government, nor would he defend it. He was a minister of the kingdom of God. His saying is well known, namely, ‘If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight; but my kingdom is no part of this world.’ (John 18: 36) The same evil, selfish organization, only operating through different governmental authorities as far as human creatures are concerned, still exists today. It is under the same management that the Roman Empire was under, namely, Satan the Devil, this world’s god. So the invisible ruler has not changed.—1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, then, Jehovah’s witnesses not being for this old wicked rule that exists in all the nations of the earth, but being for the kingdom of God which will rule in righteousness, it can easily be seen why they are not divided as are the Roman Catholics, the Protestant organizations, the Jewish organizations, and all other religious bodies throughout the world. The people of all the different religions in the various lands, being of different nationalities and political connections, are divided against one another. This state will not be found among those consecrated to Jehovah as God. They are one organization, no matter where they reside. Difference of speech does not hold them apart. Customs do not divide them. Even the governments over them do not matter. It makes no difference what form of government may rule over them, democratic, Nazi, Communistic, Jewish, totalitarian, or autocratic, such governments are not allowed to stand as a barrier to Jehovah’s witnesses in their united service for the Almighty. They are not of this old world, but are for the kingdom of God by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">his Christ. In this way they are different, not conformed to this world.—Romans 12: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the days of the early church the apostles and their fellow Christians of that time followed the command of Christ Jesus: “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> So they went into Greece, Italy, Egypt, Babylon, and Asia Minor, even though there were people in those places with different habits, customs, and forms of governments, most of them under Roman imperialism. But people who loved righteousness there learned the truth and became Christians. They left all their former religious idol-worship and their political organizations, and followed the teachings of Christ. A complete change took place in their lives. It did not take them long to see that it was better to obey God rather than men; for the only way to receive life would be by being faithful to the great Life-giver in heaven. As God said, he himself is the Savior, and it is he alone that can give everlasting life and blessings in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The political systems and nations of the world have, for centuries, yes, for thousands of years, tried to give the people better government; but will anyone today say that conditions are better in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in America, than they were twenty years ago? a hundred years ago? or a thousand years ago? One will argue that living conditions are better; but who say so, and where ? Only in a few countries. The point is, Is man more unselfish? Does he love his neighbor more? or is he the same stubborn idol-worshiper that he was in all times past?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that among the ranks of the witnesses of the Lord God you will find persons from every walk of life, from every nation, from every kindred, and from every language, but, different from this world, they have all the same spirit of love and peace toward their neighbor, and a desire to praise the one God, Jehovah, and to sing his praises unto all the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their indefeatable zeal is a thing that, even though the worldly governmental authorities try to do so, they are unsuccessful in breaking.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>MINISTERS OVER OBJECTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In many parts of the world that have come under the power of great religious influence the authorities in power do not like to recognize Jehovah’s witnesses as ordained ministers, although they are commissioned of God as such. The authorities object because these ministers are different. They do not realize that one man cannot make another man a minister of God. Being a minister of God is by reason of his pouring upon his servant the holy spirit or active force from on high; and this outpouring the Most High God says he will perform upon those who love him in truth. God has poured out his spirit “upon all flesh”: men and women, young and old, bond and free. He did this to the faithful remnant at the time of Pentecost A.D. 33, and he is doing it to a like remnant at the present time. (Joel 2:28,29; Acts 2:17,18) His spirit motivates those who have made a consecration to serve him to preach the gospel, and it makes no difference whether those individuals be young or old. If the heart of each one is right and is seeking righteousness and is fully devoted to the Lord God, he will be favored of Jehovah God with his spirit through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The objection is made by many rulers and judges that young people are not qualified to preach the gospel. They think that a person has to become old and hoary of head before being able to have wisdom and understanding. They forget to take into account the activities of the person in making their decision as to whether that person is an ordained minister or not. Christ Jesus was busy about his Father’s courts when at the age of twelve. (Luke 2:42-49, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Diaglott; An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> The apostle Paul’s companion, Timothy, was a young man when he was called and anointed of the Lord to preach the gospel, and the churches as well as Timothy himself were advised not to despise his youth. (1 Tim. 4:12) The Bible presents, in fact, a long record of young persons that have stood for the Lord God and fought valiantly in their youth as well as in their older age for the preaching of the message of God’s Word. Jeremiah, Samuel, and others, were recorded as excellent examples of youths taking up the ministry of God as preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Coming down to later, secular history, let us take John Calvin, the sixteenth century reformer and student of the Bible and minister of religion. Was he not recognized as a chaplain at the age of twelve years? Yes; and if this John Calvin could be recognized and put in office as a minister of religion, certainly young men and women of today who are as devoted to God as John Calvin ever was can also be acknowledged by Worldly authorities as ministers of God. Not only was John Calvin a preacher in the Roman Catholic religious organization at the age of twelve, but his revenue from preaching was sufficient to assist him in going through school in his later years. It is recorded in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> Volume 4, edition of 1892, that John Calvin, who was born in 1509, was made a chaplain as described: “In his thirteenth year his father, whose circumstances were not affluent, procured for him from the bishop the office of chaplain in the Chapelle de Notre Dame de la Gesine. A few days after his appointment he received the tonsure and on the 29th of May 1521, he was installed in his office.” Centuries earlier, Benedict IX was installed as pope at the age of 12 and continued in office from 1033 to 1056.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certainly, if John Calvin qualified as a minister or chaplain in the Roman Catholic religious system, and if Benedict IX qualified as pope of Rome, both at the age of twelve years, then hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses, who have made a careful study of the Bible along unseetarian lines, can qualify for ministerial status, while yet in their teens, before governing bodies in the world today. There are hundreds of young men and women from sixteen to twenty-two years of age that have gone out into the missionary field work, many to foreign lands, learning tongues not their own, in order that they may there preach the gospel. Youth is no barrier to one’s becoming a minister. One who does become a minister for the Lord will daily preach the good news. It has always been recognized that ministers would take a neutral position as to world affairs and that they are indifferent to the controversies of the world, because they are not of this world nor a part of it, although they are in it. (1 John 2:15-17) In the same way Christ Jesus was not of this world. He was in it, but this was for the sole purpose of preaching the gospel and vindicating his Father’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, in a prayer to his Father in heaven, requested him that the same spirit that was poured upon him be poured upon all his followers, and he asked his Father not to take them out of the world but to leave them there that they might preach the good news of the Kingdom and so some could be saved. (John 17:14,15; 14:16,17) This makes it plain that age is not the determining factor with God’s ministers, neither is sex; but the thing that qualifies one as a minister is his knowledge of the Lord’s Word and his zeal and devotion to the Most High Sovereign, Jehovah, and, most importantly, the spirit of the Lord God upon him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>NONNATIONALISTIC ORGANIZATION WORLD-WIDE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time government officials in various parts of the earth make claims that Jehovah’s witnesses are controlled by an American organization and that Jehovah’s witnesses are spreading American propaganda. However, it will readily be understood by all persons reading any of the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses that are printed and distributed through the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation in America, that none of their teachings are nationalistic. They set forth the belief in the kingdom of God as the only hope of the world of mankind. That kingdom is what the witnesses serve, and they look to Christ Jesus as their Commander and Leader, who is above all nations and political parties. Just that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society happens to be formed in the United States and is used by Jehovah’s witnesses of that country and of many other countries to carry on their ministerial activity is no reason for persons to say that the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the earth is an American organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In different countries of Latin America and throughout Europe and on the other continents of the earth Jehovah’s witnesses have formed local organizations, or societies within the country in which they reside, so as to further the interests of their ministerial activity there. Such societies are just as necessary locally as the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society in America. And just because a society is formed in one particular country, it would be no reason to say that Jehovah’s witnesses of that respective country are French or German or Brazilian. Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide have one aim in life, and that is to magnify the name of their heavenly Father, Jehovah, and to share with Christ Jesus in the vindication of his name and Word. They realize that he has gathered together the persons of good-will who love him into one organization, and that is, a Theocratic organization. Theocratic, yes, but not nationalistic are these witnesses of Jehovah. Because governments of men have set up boundaries and have adopted certain languages for certain territories, and because some of God’s consecrated people live in those particular lands, these are no reasons for believing that they are separate and distinct from all the other witnesses of the Most High God throughout the earth. They are not. They are one body in the Lord, one organization, with one God Jehovah and one Lord Jesus Christ and one law. That is the law God has given them, namely, to minister to him and to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>NONPARTISANSHIP</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There you have the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses, scattered in scores of lands, will not engage in carnal warfare one against another, because they will not violently fight their brethren. At the same time the Lord’s faithful servants will not interfere in a violent combat between nations. They are neutral as to the political affairs and military operations of nations, and they look to Jehovah God as the one that gives life and has the right to take it away, and the One who can also preserve them into the new world of uprightness where they will enjoy peace, prosperity and everlasting life. They fully appreciate that God’s Word says that his servants will come from every nation, tribe and tongue but that, because of having his spirit, they will be one people to him, a chosen generation, devoted to peace. Knowing that they are his chosen people under the one Theocratic law, they serve him with undivided attention. They have the proper fear of God, for they hate the evil, the arrogance, the pride and Godlessness of this world. There is no room for partisanship among them. All are for the one ideal, the new-world government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Logically, in obedience to the divine commands for this day, such persons as these are putting forth every effort to push forward the principles of truth and righteousness and to turn the minds of the people toward the one true Deity and his gracious Word, the Bible. This they will continue to do right on down to the final war, the long-predicted Armageddon. Come opposition, trials, persecution and other troubles from the governmental agents or the governments themselves, they will move ahead fearlessly and courageously, standing for Jehovah’s “King of kings and Lord of lords”, Christ Jesus. This has been wonderfully demonstrated, during the year of 1947 just gone. An unbiased person has just to read the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font5">covering this past year’s activities throughout the world by Jehovah’s witnesses to grasp with ease that these are one people, one organization, a Theocratic organization; and that they look to Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ, as “The Higher Powers” who are guiding and directing their activities. The reader of such </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> after considering the reports from 88 nations or individually governed territory should be helped to realize that the witnesses are not serving any man or any worldly organization, and that the organization which the witnesses have is not American, German, French, Communistic, or Jewish, but is a God-directed organization, or Theocratic, and that the members thereof are interested solely in the lasting peace and good-will of the peoples everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What time do they have for dabbling in political campaigns and battles, or in trying to influence the secular governments as to what course of action they should take in the present-day struggle for world domination? Their commission to preach takes the best of their time, and their devotion to the principles of truth and integrity and uncorruptness grips them all their time. They fully know and are persuaded that the only way for peace and perfect happiness to be brought to the human family is by man’s accepting Jehovah God as the Supreme One of the universe and also accepting his Son, his chief witness, as the Ransomer of mankind and as the rightful King of the new world. This One, before his own death on the tree of torture, said in prayer to his heavenly Father: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Ah, yes, Jehovah God has made the provisions for man to get life through his Son. Jehovah is the real Life-giver, and all human creatures that hope to have life in the beautified, peaceful world without end will have to abide by his provisions and accept him as God and his Son as the Redeemer and King. Jehovah’s witnesses are different from this old world because they conform to these divine requirements for life. Thousands upon thousands of persons of goodwill who love truth and who have turned a hearing ear to their message have sought the Lord God and have associated themselves with the Theocratic organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and have joyfully joined them in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>THEIR PROOF OF MINISTRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking one language, the truth, from one end of the earth to the other, Jehovah’s witnesses in the service year 1947 have piled up a mighty ‘heap of witness’ to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. Again they have proved themselves to be a society of ordained ministers. They have faithfully preached the good news of God’s kingdom to millions of persons and have shown what the ‘joy of all the people’ really is. Throughout the year 181,071 of Jehovah’s witnesses have regularly preached the gospel, in 86 different lands—the principal nations, the isles of the sea, and the colonies of the great powers. They are found working in the states and provinces of all countries, the cities, the towns, and the rural countryside. The world is their field, and they are trying to reach the people in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the service year of 1947 these hard-working servants of the Most High devoted 43,842,305 hours to preaching. Their devotion to the truth and ministerial work resulted in many associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, and these persons faithfully followed Christ Jesus and became publishers of the Kingdom, too. A new all-time record was reached, namely, 207,552 ministers participating in the field-service work during the year 1947. It is sincerely hoped that all these persons will be regular publishers in 1948, so that the command of Jesus, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,” may be accomplished on an even greater scale in the years ahead before the final battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These new publishers of the Kingdom, along with those who have been in the way for many years, realize that it pays to be different from this old world. The broad way leads to destruction; the new way, God’s way, leads to eternal life. This narrow way will bring reproach, suffering and persecution to the servants of God, but they appreciate that their faithful continuance and endurance will bring life and contentment. They have come to know the only God, Jehovah, and his Son Christ Jesus. They have learned of God’s kingdom and the blessings it holds, and it is their keen desire to share in these blessings and bring praise unto the Lord forever. It is now said by them: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> will sing praises unto thee among the nations” (Ps. 57:9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.),</span><span class="font5"> which is Jehovah’s witnesses’ yeartext for 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is of real interest to consider the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses during the past twelve months. They distributed 20,472,739 books and booklets, in scores of languages, in 86 countries, provinces and isles of the sea. In addition to this they placed 12,049,344 individual copies of the magazines </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and these in many languages. Not only that, but they interested the readers of these magazines to subscribe for a full year, and the number of new subscriptions obtained by the publishers was 563,101. In a four-month campaign for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions they obtained 313,786 such subscriptions. Jehovah’s witnesses are grateful to God for the opportunity of placing with the people something that they could read and study in their own homes, especially the Bible and books to help one understand the Bible. Since 1920 they have placed 513,186,451 books, Bibles and booklets with the people; but they know this is not all that is necessary. If people are to come to a knowledge of the truth, they need personal help, and to this end Jehovah’s witnesses make millions of calls upon them. Invited into their homes, they sit down with the people and answer their questions and look up scriptures in the Bible to prove their teachings; and thus they truly bring comfort to those who mourn in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only do Jehovah’s witnesses preach the gospel from house to house and publicly, but they spend much time in giving private instruction, as a minister of God should. World-wide, Jehovah’s witnesses made 11,710,832 visits to the homes of persons interested. In fact, every week there are conducted throughout the world 113,035 book studies. In these little private home meetings there are usually from two to eight persons who study regularly every week some publication of the Society, along with the Bible, under the private instruction of a minister, one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While much attention is given to the private study with individuals, Jehovah’s witnesses make public proclamation, too. Thousands of auditoriums, public parks and other open-air meeting-places have been used by Jehovah’s ordained ministers for public meetings. In all nations and languages these meetings have been carried on during the past year, to the extent of 101,632 different meetings. The attendance at these meetings runs into the millions. On one Sunday alone, when a check was made of attendance, 252,582 persons in all parts of the world listened to the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses today are like the apostle Paul in that they do not need a letter written in ink by someone to prove they are ministers of the gospel. Paul said: “For I am no peddler of God’s message, like most men, but like a man of sincerity, commissioned by God and in his presence, in union with Christ I utter his message ... Do I, like some people, need letters of recommendation to you or from you? You are my recommendations, written on my heart, for everybody to read and understand. You show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by me, written not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, and not on tablets of stone, but on the human heart.” (2 Cor. 2:17; 3:1-3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span><span class="font5">) The 158,034 of Jehovah’s witnesses in the field during 1946 have a letter of commendation that is a real recommendation of their faithful ministry, for in 1947 there were associated regularly with them 181,071 publishers of the Kingdom, or an increase of 23,037. And there are many more now that are showing zeal for the only righteous cause, which will succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do Jehovah’s witnesses need letters written by men? or do the facts prove that they have recommendations written in the hearts of those who love the Kingdom? All the world knows that Jehovah’s witnesses have proof of their ministry, but it is not orthodox; however, they do their work like the Master, Jesus. They are not ‘peddlers of God’s message, like most men’. Jehovah’s witnesses are devoting their time, their money, their strength, their all, in the service of God. During the past service year the Society sent from the Brooklyn office alone to Branches and missionary homes $256,661.77 in cash to help the expansion work, this in addition to supplying the Branches with literature valued at $388,606.44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither do Jehovah’s witnesses neglect the association of themselves together; for throughout the world there were 10,782 companies organized. At these meetings Jehovah’s witnesses come together to further fit themselves for the ministry. At the company meetings every week they study the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, which contains spiritual food. They have their service meetings, where they learn ways and means of better presenting the gospel to the people; they have a course in Theocratic ministry, which equips them all to make better expression of the Lord’s word to others. Truly they are ministers of God, equipping themselves for every good work. To all these study meetings people of good-will are invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have an unusual privilege and responsibility. They accept it and are glad that they are the servants of the Most High God. They are diligently putting forth every effort to turn the minds of all men and women, no matter of what nation, kindred or tongue, to Jehovah God in true worship. It is their desire to see all people singing Jehovah’s praises, so that they may gain life eternal and live in the New World of righteousness where peace and prosperity will be the heritage of the nations. Yes, they are determined by God’s grace to give proof of their ministry to many thousands more who join with them in the grand song of praise to Jehovah among the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So that the readers of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> may have some idea of what is being accomplished in the many nations and lands of the earth a table is set out giving some of the details. (See pages 28 to 31.) The reports from all these nations prove beyond question that Jehovah’s witnesses are taking an uncompromising stand for God’s kingdom, and that all of them everywhere are singing praises unto Jehovah among the nations. (Ps. 57: 9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.</span><span class="font5">) What a joy is theirs!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States of America have enjoyed Jehovah’s rich blessing. His ministers in this country have done excellent work in preaching the glorious gospel of the Kingdom and, by the Lord’s grace, they have used every instrument provided for the advancement of the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was back in 1884 that a group of Christian men and women gathered together and formed the Watch Tower Bl-ble &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation. In these modern days Jehovah’s witnesses use this corporation, the first association of men and women dedicated to the purpose of promulgating the message concerning God’s kingdom established for the blessing of all people, to further their activity. The work of this Society now reaches out into many nations of the earth, where Branches have been established and missionary homes set up, all of which come under the direction of this Pennsylvania corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 1909 it seemed advisable to open offices in New York to more efficiently direct the work in the United States, and so what is now known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., was formed. This New York Society, also used by Jehovah’s witnesses, operates a printing plant and maintains a large Bethel home to house the volunteer workers engaged in service at the plant. It also owns and operates a radio station, WBBR, faithfully serving New York city and its adjoining communities with God’s Word of truth. In these various institutions, as well as at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, South Lansing, New York, the Society trains ministers for missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Jehovah’s witnesses grew in other countries additional societies were formed, all of which work in conjunction with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, for their aims and purposes are the same. The Christian people who were meeting together in London, England, formed a society in 1914 known as the International Bible Students Association. This Association owns certain properties, housing a Branch office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, printing plant and shipping department. In other nations of the earth it has been advisable to establish corporations to facilitate the work of Jehovah’s witnesses; and the charters of these corporations have provisions similar to that of the Pennsylvania corporation, the principal one being that which provides for the preaching of the gospel in all the world for a witness.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 27) </span><span class="font4">the Bethel home, and their lives are consecrated to the doing of the Lord’s will. These individuals reside at Bethel voluntarily. All receive the same allowance each month, namely, $10.00, which covers incidental expenses. Adequate provisions are made for their care, so as to keep them in good health and able to perform their respective duties in and about the home, radio station, factory and offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The broadcasting station, WBBR, had its studios at 124 Columbia Heights up until recently, when the city of New York began the construction of a super-highway in the Borough of Brooklyn. The city needed some of the property on which the Bethel home was situated and therefore instituted condemnation proceedings in the courts to obtain this property. Such action made necessary considerable changes in the Bethel home, and also compelled the Society to make preparations for the construction of a large addition to the present home. The studios of WBBR have been transferred temporarily to the transmitter site at Staten Island. At the same time the Society made application to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to increase the power of the station. This has since been granted, and preparations are under way now at Staten Island for the erection of three large antennse towers and Installation of sufficient new equipment to bring the power of WBBR up to five thousand watts. The station lays down a good signal over all of New York city and vicinity, and this gives opportunity to millions of persons to hear clearly explained the good news of God’s kingdom. With the new equipment and resultant increase in power a much greater area will be reached, thus expanding the radio service in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the city’s taking away the greater portion of the old part of the Bethel home, the family has been broken up. That is to say, many of the brethren working full time in Bethel service are now living In other quarters. The Society has obtained properties adjoining the present Bethel home for the construction of a new building; however, full possession of the property cannot be gotten until the tenants renting apartments in these homes move out It is believed that all these apartments will be vacant by the early part of February, and then demolition proceedings can begin and construction start on the new and enlarged Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is planned to include In this new building improved, modern studios for WBBR, as well as a large assembly room accommodating at least four hundred persons. This latter room will be used for the Bethel family’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, service meeting and other general assemblies. A new kitchen and dining room will also be part of the new structure, because these facilities were lost in the demolition of the older part of the home. Provision is being made for a larger laundry, as well as for many other conveniences that will aid the members of the family in their service for the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Regular study and instruction are given to all persons living in the Bethel home. They are ordained ministers and have proved themselves as such by their good works, but they never cease to study the Lord’s Word, which is “meat in due season”. Practically all these ministers are assigned special duties in the preaching of the gospel. Many of them serve congregations in New York city; others are sent out regularly to near-by company organizations and serve on week-ends. In addition to those who live in the Bethel home there are hundreds of other ministers that the Society directs and sends from place to place. Those ordained ministers who come under the direct supervision of the Society are listed below. However, it should be kept in mind that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society Is a society of ministers ; and Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide have all prepared themselves for ministerial duty. “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,” said Jesus. This Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in all nations. They are desirous of guiding the people into the way of life, and they accept as their commission Isaiah 61:1-3 and Matthew 24:14, along with the many other commands of God to preach this gospel.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This Christian school, operated by the New York corporation, trains men and women for foreign missionary service. A call has gone forth throughout the land for ordained ministers who are willing to go into other countries, there to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in the languages spoken by the people that they go to serve. Men and women alike, all ordained ministers who have proved faithful in their service for the King and the Kingdom over a period of years, are invited to this school. All expenses of the ministers brought to Gilead are paid by the Society. Rooms and meals are provided, and free education is given to them, because the Society is anxious to fulfill its mission of carrying on the expansion work of preaching the gospel. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gilead</span><span class="font5"> means “heap of witness”, and certainly from this school have gone forth many zealous ministers to foreign missionary fields, there to assist “other sheep” of the Lord, feed them and establish them in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From year to year the courses at Gilead are changed to keep abreast with the brilliant flashes of light that burst forth continually from the Lord’s temple. The instructors, also ordained ministers, are alert and constantly strive to improve their instruction methods. Their principal objective is to aid the student in better wielding the “sword of the spirit”, and to teach him how to more adequately employ the shield of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the service year 1947 two classes completed their studies, the eighth and ninth, graduating 201 students from this Theocratic school. Since the founding of the school in February, 1943, 909 persons have been enrolled. Of this number 860 have finished the course of study, and 801 received diplomas of merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The school was not established for the exclusive benefit of ministers in the United States; therefore the Society brings to the school ministers from all parts of the world who are qualified for missionary work. During the past year the Society was able for the first time to enroll many ministers from other countries. In fact, eighteen nations were represented in the eighth class at Gilead. These consecrated men and women have since gone out to many countries of the world, carrying to the people of the earth the good message of God’s kingdom, which is their only hope. It was on February 9, 1947, that 714 people gathered together for the midwinter graduation exercises. Ninety-nine finished the course, 94 of whom received diplomas of merit; but all qualified to be representatives of the Society in doing missionary work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It was just two weeks after the graduation of the eighth class that the ninth class matriculated to start its training for foreign service. Of the 105 students registered, 64 came from Canada, direct from the fighting front at Catholic Quebec. These, along with other brethren, were brought to the school to receive special training in ministerial work and missionary service for that part of the world, as well as to study the French language so as to be better equipped for the preaching of the gospel in Quebec territory. This was the first time that French was taught in the school; theretofore Spanish was the language in which instruction was given in preparation for foreign service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday, August 3, a beautiful summer day, the graduation exercises for the ninth class were held outdoors on the school’s campus. An audience of 1,857 assembled, hundreds of them coming from Canada and distant parts of the United States. Finishing the course were 102 students, and of these 88 received the award of a diploma.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A report on the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead would not be complete without mentioning the school’s new library building. The students of the seventh, eighth and ninth classes assisted other brethren called in to construct this library. It is a two-story reinforced concrete-brick structure of beautiful design. The entire first floor comprises one grand hall, with fir wood paneled walls, an acoustically treated ceiling, and red rubber tiled floor. It Is altogether a very lovely building, richly and most modernly equipped and furnished. The school’s library of five thousand volumes is well classified and shelved at one end of the hall. The books in the library deal mainly with Bible subjects and are Bible reference books. At the opposite end of this beautiful hall Is a modernly equipped classroom. The name given to the library building is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Shiloah,</span><span class="font4"> which means “sending forth”. Surely the Lord has blessed Gilead in sending forth such a heap of witness, even unto the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This school of Bible learning is located on a farm owned and operated by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. The men and women who operate this farm are also ordained ministers and are of great assistance to the students who come to the school. In addition to working on the farm and taking care of necessary details about the campus, these brethren also serve congregations in evenings and on week-ends. The crops raised on the farm make it possible for the Society to give good, wholesome food to all the students, as well as supply large quantities of nourishing provisions to the Bethel family In Brooklyn. During the season of the year when many of the crops are being harvested much of the produce is canned for use during the winter months. An efficient, progressive organization exists on this farm associated with Gilead school, and all persons work together as one big family, helping one another in studies and in preparation for work in missionary homes in other lands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the year 1927 the Society completed its own new factory building at the above address in Brooklyn, N. Y. Twenty years ago this provided ample room for the work to be done and, so it appeared, plenty of room for expansion. But after ten years this large eight-story building (100x100 feet) became overcrowded and an extension was built to the factory. This was in 1937. Now, in 1947, everything in the factory is overcrowded and it seems advisable to build another addition just as soon as arrangements can be made to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But overcrowdedness was not the only difficulty the printery had during the 1947 service year. In August, 1946, it was announced at the Cleveland assembly that the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> would replace </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> Right after this convention the Society was notified that the newsprint mill from which we had been purchasing paper and with whom we had contracts year by year for seven consecutive years would not now renew the contract for 1947. The Society felt sure that the new magazine, with its change In contents and literary style, along with some improvements in its appearance, would be accepted readily by the public— and it was. The problem now was the procuring of sufficient paper. Thirty-six paper mills and distributors throughout the United States and Canada were contacted in search of paper, but to no avail. Small quantities were obtainable from time to time and, with the reserve on hand, it was possible to publish every issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> during the year. Exorbitant prices were paid for whatever newsprint paper the Society was able to purchase. Some of the European paper purchased cost 2j times as much as the standard newsprint price in the United States, but it was impossible to buy paper in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to satisfy the subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> making certain that they received their magazines each month, every conservation had to be made in the use of paper. In order to keep the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine going the Brooklyn factory had to cease printing booklets, which used newsprint paper. By the Lord’s grace the year was finished and not an issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> failed to make its appearance on time. It was necessary, however, to cut down on the printing requirements for all issues. As the year closes the Society still has some paper, and it is hoped that more will be available in 1948 so that the printing of booklets can be started again, especially in languages other than English, so that our European brethren may have supplies to carry on their service activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The shortage of paper for booklets did not interfere with the operation of the presses, because at all times we were able to obtain book paper and sufficient to keep the magazines going. This resulted in 1947’s being a book and magazine year, with an all-time high production for both of these types of publications. A new peak was reached in the production of bound books, which peak was 4,261,345 volumes. The highest all-time peak previous to this was 3,786,630 books. The greatest demand was for the publication </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Ood Be True”.</span><span class="font4"> There were more than 2,700,000 copies of this book printed and prepared for the publishers during the year. A consideration of the following table, which sets out the production of the factory, is very interesting and encouraging. It shows great increases in the production of books and magazines, but a decrease in booklets, the latter being due only to the shortage of paper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In order to produce the above quantities of publications it was necessary for the Society to increase the number of brethren working at the factory to 211, in addition to the 64 serving in the Bethel home full time. The brethren in the Bethel home recognize and accept their privilege of service as a rich blessing from the Lord and appreciate that they work under His direction. The Bethel family cherishes its God-given treasure of serving the brethren in all the nations. As the call for more literature comes from the brethren throughout the world, their hearts are made glad and they are anxious to render additional service, if need be, by working extra time in evenings or on week-ends. They are unselfishly devoted to the Kingdom interests and are striving diligently to meet the increased demands for literature. It is an honor and a privilege to be a member of this fine family of Christian men and women. Each one has taken good care of the work assigned to him in the Bethel home, factory and office, all fully appreciating that their service is as unto the Lord, not unto men.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font4">All the brethren are delighted with the expansion program. Even though they live under conditions not as pleasant as in the past, because of being scattered about the city, still they look to the progress of the work. One of the first moves in the expansion program was the purchase of a new 525-horsepower, 6-cylinder Diesel engine, which will produce electrical power for the present factory and the new addition the Society hopes to construct soon. This Diesel supplements the two similar engines in service for the past twenty years. Before another service year goes by the members of the family hope to see good progress in the construction of the new Bethel home.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>FIELD WORK IN THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding in the service year 1947 were the new instruments placed in the hands of the publishers: the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine, which was used early in the year for a special campaign, and the new books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot; </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> which were used extensively in the educational campaign throughout America. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace&quot;</span><span class="font4"> booklet had a good start but, due to the shortage of paper, did not get the distribution it ordinarily would have had. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake! </span><span class="font4">campaign, during January to April of the year, was very successful. The brethren in the United States turned in more than 210,000 subscriptions as their part of the worldwide quota of 300,(MX) new subscriptions for the magazines, which was reached by Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth during the four months of the campaign’s duration. The publishers appreciate the need of placing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in the hands of the people, especially those of goodwill ; therefore they have stressed this journal and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> took the lead over </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font4"> during 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A </span><span class="font4">great work was accomplished in the United States, especially In the rural areas, when the brethren distributed three bound books on a contribution of $1.00, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;. </span><span class="font4">The public meetings played their part In the rural sections, as well as in the cities, and the brethren arranged for 37,359 public meetings, to compare with 28,703 of the previous year. There were printed 92,057,200 handbills for the publishers to use in advertising these public meetings. This Is probably the greatest number of handbills ever distributed by the Society through Jehovah’s witnesses in one year’s time in the United States. A marvelous witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The servant to the brethren work played an Important part in organization, and the circuit assemblies were greatly appreciated by the publishers. These small conventions every six months, situated conveniently for the brethren in different sections of the country, have helped the publishers of the Kingdom to appreciate to a greater extent their privilege of advertising the King and the Kingdom. The Lord has richly blessed the work in the United States and has gathered together many of the “other sheep”. In April of 1947 a new peak in publishers was reached, namely, 73,512 singers for the King and the Kingdom. What a tremendous work has been accomplished in all forty-eight states! Yet there is much work still to be done. The company publishers, who represent about 95 percent of all publishers in the country, are doing splendid service. They are aiding the people of good-will through book studies and back-calls. Five percent of the total number of publishers are pioneers, and there is plenty of territory for more pioneers in the United States. For some reason or other the average number of pioneers in the field monthly decreased. There were, on the average, 352 fewer pioneers during the service year 1947 than during the previous year. It is hoped that many of those who have stepped aside for a short season will be able to again take up the pioneer service, so that the millions of people in the United States who have not as yet been reached by the message of the Kingdom may be aided. The Society aided full-time ministers in the United States to the extent of $227,705.75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest event of the year in the United States, and that which brought the service year to a close, was the “All Nations Expansion” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Los Angeles, August 13-17. The brethren worked hard at home throughout the year and made preparations for the trek to Los Angeles. Early in August the cross-country highways began to be traveled by cars, trailers, trucks and busses, all with that telltale Theocratic assembly look, as brethren from all parts of the United States and Canada converged on Los Angeles. Then came the special trains and planes with thousands more of the brethren, until the attendance at Los Angeles swelled to 30,000. It cost the brethren much financially, and also a great physical effort, but they did appreciate the rich blessing poured out upon them during the five days of the assembly. They appreciated the world-wide expansion work and the share they themselves had had and will continue to have in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From beginning to end the assembly was packed with Theocratic truths and high-lighted the theme of advancing true worship. The talk “All Nations Expansion” given by the president of the Society on Friday evening showed clearly the course the organization must take. Each individual should clear the decks for all-out ministry for the Kingdom. No leaning on the arm of flesh nor trusting in what any man may say; but each one must go forward, relying upon God’s Word as the guide. Our brethren in many countries have pressed on, singing the high praises of God even though not in direct communication with their fellow servants at Brooklyn. Did they not continue to preach, though they had no literature? though fhey had no visible organization locally? and even though they had no one to whom they could report? With the ministry most Important all nonessentiais must be swept aside, even to the point of disposing of Beth-Sarim. This rule of action was applied: Everything that might be a hindrance or is not needed in the advancing of the Kingdom interests should be done away with. The brethren appreciated this theme and looked forward to the coming year with joy to praise the Lord by showing forth their good works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Expression was made on the part of all attending the assembly of their keen desire to help the brethren in Europe by making financial contributions to the Society; also, they expressed themselves willing, if the call came, to supply more clothing, particularly if such can be gotten into Germany. They were going to support any work that would advance the preaching of the gospel in other lands. The conventioners were delighted though no new publication was released at Los Angeles, because they knew that the Society had to get out translations of publications already in use in the English language and that this was keeping the presses busy. They were happy to hear that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’</span><span class="font4"> and other publications were being translated and shipped into other countries so that the work might expand. We in America can get along very well with our present supplies and instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of the convention came on Sunday afternoon when the public talk was delivered on the subject “Permanent Governor of All Nations”. Everyone was surprised and pleased when it was learned that 45,729 persons had packed out the stadium, filled all the seats placed on the playing field, overflowed the tents adjoining the stadium, and provided a goodly number of listeners at the trailer camp. More than 10,000 strangers and persons of good-will attended the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1947 saw expansion in the United States, but not without its trials and difficulties for the publishers in the field. The Legal Department points out that there have been numerous instances of threats of arrests by police officials, but that when these officials were confronted with the law and the buttress of decisions gained by Jehovah’s witnesses during the past several years they backed down, failing to carry out their threats of arrest. Violence was experienced by brethren in some parts of the country, but these instances were very few compared with former years. The biggest opposition experienced in the field has been because of the public meetings in parks and halls. Widespread advertising of public lectures in some communities stirred the enemy up to opposition to the progress of The Theocracy due to these public meetings. Pressure was exerted upon the private owners of halls to cancel contracts, sometimes at the last minute, including public parks and municipally owned auditoriums; but even these cancellations due to religious and political pressure were few compared with the large number of public meetings held throughout the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most notorious instances of violent opposition was in Lacona, Iowa. There the brethren were mobbed on September 8, 1946, and prevented from holding a public lecture in the town park of Lacona. The details have been published elsewhere regarding this particular case. Jehovah’s witnesses Instituted an injunction suit in the United States District Court of Des Moines. The judge of that court ruled against Jehovah’s witnesses, but the case has been appealed to the Federal Court of St. Paul, Minnesota. This case was argued in the summer of 1947. The decision of the court had not been given by the end of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Legal Desk handled many matters involving taxes, work with the Department of Justice, Supreme Court cases In connection with the Selective Service Act, as well as will-contest matters to protect money left to the Society against the demands of disgruntled relatives of brethren who desired to give their funds to advance the Kingdom work. Relatives often do not like to see the wishes of the deceased person carried out, and therefore they take the matter to court. Brethren can very easily avoid this action on the part of relatives by consulting the Society and making their wishes known before death comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many problems arising outside of the country that need the attention of the Legal Desk, too, and much counsel and advice has been given to Branch offices relative to the handling of legal matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the difficulties experienced by Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States they have moved forward and are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to endure to the very end. They are determined to carry out their ministry. They do appreciate that there is still much work to tie done, not only in other lands but also right here in the United States. This being their assignment, they rejoice in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font5">There are certain publishers in various parts of the earth that are not directly under any near-by Branch, and therefore these brethren are requested to report to the United States Branch. Last year there were 199 isolated publishers reporting from outlying countries, but this year the number has increased to 294. This is mainly due to the fact that the Society sent missionaries into some countries to stimulate the work. The literature placement lias increased in these fourteen countries, too. In the last twelve months 82,928 books and booklets were placed, to compare with 60,101 for the previous year. With Gilead graduates now working in almost all the countries briefly reviewed after the conclusion of this paragraph, the work is on the increase. Knowing that the back-calls are stepping stones to-real instruction, the publishers in these different places conducted 29,221 back-calls in the year, as against 16,513 last year. On the average, they are conducting 398 book studies with interested people. While the average number of publishers in the field for the year was 294, we did reach a new high of publishers of 514 in the month of August. This shows that in the islands and isolated spots throughout the world, where not much Kingdom work has been carried forward, there is a definite increase and a desire on the part of the people to know the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The high cost of living and the indifference on the part of the people make it quite difficult for the publishers of the Kingdom to make progress here. There are great hardships to overcome, both climatic and because of the high degree of transiency among the people. The work is seasonal, so that people coming into the country live there for a few months and then travel back to the United States again. However, the publishers for the Kingdom are earnest In their endeavor to advance the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year there was an average of seven special pioneers working in different parts of Alaska. Associated with them were ten publishers, making an average of seventeen publishers for the Kingdom in that territory. They did not make as many back-calls or conduct as many book studies as in the previous year, but the decline has been very slight. There are three small companies organized, and we hope these will grow. The desire of the people in general Is to make money fast, and this leaves them little time to study the truth or even to listen to it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Excellent work has been accomplished in these small islands. A year ago there were only three publishers there. The Society was able to send four special publishers into the Bahamas, and now there are seventeen publishers all together. There has been a real distribution of literature. Distributed were 5,245 books and booklets, to compare with the 20 volumes put out last year. The back-call work is moving along splendidly, as well as the book-study activity. Fifty-seven book studies are being conducted monthly by all the publishers. A company has been organized and the servants of the Lord comprising this company, assisted by the Gilead-trained missionaries, are making good progress. The August, 1947, report showed 27 publishers now conducting a total of 114 studies in the territory. This means that more people will be reached with the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the past service year it was possible for the Society to send two graduates of Gilead to Bermuda. There were already two publishers of the Kingdom in these islands and they needed help. A good distribution of literature was made, but the brethren are meeting up with some difficulty, particularly with the authorities, who do not like to hear the truth preached to the people. However, the obstacles are being overcome and the brethren are conducting many book studies, 35 in number. Good interest is shown.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A brother who speaks Greek and English, a graduate of Gilead, was sent to Cyprus to help the small organization of Jehovah’s witnesses In that island. The early church preached the Kingdom message in that territory, and now the preaching work is being revived again. Five companies have been organized, and 37 pralsers of the Lord are associating themselves together to look after the Kingdom interests. They distributed 12,650 books and booklets, as well as 3,562 magazines. Many back-calls are being made, and 23 book studies are being conducted regularly every week, to compare with 17 a year ago.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This is a new country that has been opened up by Jehovah’s witnesses for the preaching of the gospel. Four Gilead-trained missionaries are now working in the capital, Quito. Associated with them are ten company publishers, making fourteen of Jehovah’s witnesses In the land. It takes real determination on the part of missionaries to go into a land where they are total strangers and where no one is in sympathy with them or believes the truth as they do, and then march ahead fearlessly and courageously, knowing that the Lord will back them up In their efforts. This the graduates of Gilead have done, and the Lord has blessed their efforts. Twenty-one book studies are now being conducted by the missionaries, and undoubtedly many of the persons attending these studies will be trained well in the handling of the “sword of the spirit”. The call to “praise Jehovah, all ye nations” is being sounded in new territory, Ecuador. The Lord’s servants will plant and water, and Jehovah will give the increase. There are three million people in this land that we should like to reach. There are many blessings in store for these publishers, who are fighters for the New World.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This is a small French island in the Caribbean. Some brethren have been holding high the message of the Lord and sounding his praises. Due to their good efforts there are now 13 publishers in Guadeloupe. It is the intention of the Society to send some missionaries to that territory to strengthen the organization and to seek out the people of good-will. There is one pioneer there now, working with the company publishers. Back-calls are being made, but not as many as should be made; and hardly any book studies are being conducted. The training that the missionaries can give the local publishers will be very beneficial.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For many, many years a lone pioneer served in this land far to the north. Two Danish brethren who finished the course at Gilead have been sent to Iceland to work with this brother to see what can be done to further the interests of the Kingdom. These brethren placed 5,978 books and booklets, along with 956 magazines. The back-call work is going on very well, the brethren having made 443 calls during the year; and they are now beginning to get book studies started. With the three pioneers having a full year ahead of them, it is believed that much good work will be accomplished in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>LEBANON AND SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A marked increase has been shown in the land of Lebanon and in near-by Syria during the past service year. It was the good pleasure of the president of the Society, along with his secretary, to visit the brethren in Lebanon and hold meetings in the city of Tripoli. Interested persons and publishers from all parts of the land came to that assembly and received good instruction. Two Gilead graduates have also been sent to Lebanon and there they are endeavoring to organize the brethren according to Theocratic arrangement. Their efforts have been blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the publishers increased from 40 to 99, on the average. Seven companies are now in operation, and a good distribution of books and booklets was made. Placed in the hands of the people were 10,448 pieces of literature, along with 9,459 magazines. Instead of spending 8,000 hours in the field work, as was done in 1946, 22,409 hours were devoted to the preaching of the gospel. This is a splendid increase over the previous year. The back-calls show a like increase, jumping from 839 to 3,803. The thing that brings about real progress in any land or territory is the devotion of the publishers to the people of good-will, which is shown by their going to the homes of such people and studying with them. Thirty-nine book studies are now conducted throughout the territory, to compare with 9 during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The missionaries from Gilead have visited the various companies and have counseled them and helped them in organization; and they have taken the people who love the Lord out in the field service with them. This not only has been an encouragement to the new witnesses of the Lord, but has taught them how to properly present the message to others. The Lord’s blessing has been very manifest upon the work in Lebanon and Syria, and we look for a continued increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is much work to be done here. Two Gilead missionaries have been sent to Liberia, there to preach to the people of this Negro republic. We have only two months’ reports, but in that little time something has been accomplished. The brethren made 206 back-calls and are conducting regularly 4 book studies. Associated with them is one company publisher. The work will, we feel sure, be on the increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This small British colony off the island of Sicily, to the south of Italy, has finally been penetrated by Kingdom publishers. Two missionaries from the Gilead school have been working there for several months, but they were arrested shortly after commencing their work. The Catholic religionists who dominate the officials have seen to it that these missionaries are taken to court, and they have put forth every effort to stop them from speaking the truth. Why the Catholic organization should be so fearful of just two missionaries who are talking the Bible is hard to understand. These two missionaries have spent as much time in the courts and with the officials of the land as they have in performing their ministerial duties, just because of the opposition of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The priests say that Malta belongs to the Catholics and everyone else must get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But these two faithful publishers have not run away, and will continue to stay in Malta as long as they can. They will remain at least until they ascertain whether there Is freedom of speech in this particular part of the British Empire. Perhaps Malta doesn’t believe in the Four Freedoms ; or is it that they don’t apply there? It takes courage to stand alone In a land and fight for freedom and for the right to preach the gospel, but these brethren are doing it. We rejoice with them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Two hard-working missionaries, graduates of Gilead, are pushing ahead in the island of Curasao. With them now there are some company publishers, increasing from 19 to 28 during the past year. During 1946 the publishers put out 3,353 books and booklets, but during 1947 they placed 13,373. This shows a marked interest on the part of the population. Thousands of back-ealls were made; and now the special publishers, along with the company publishers, are conducting 32 book studies, to compare with 22 a year ago. Two companies have been organized, and all publishers are very anxious to help the Dutch-speaking people. Here in the little Islands of the Netherlands West Indies some people are singing the praises of God to all the nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This country and its internal affairs have held frontpage notice In practically all countries of the world. The issues are political and religious, but it is certainly not the desire of the Jews to praise the name of Jehovah God in their effort to return to Palestine. It is merely their desire to have a homeland or country of their own, and this has nothing to do with the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. They are not anxious to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society made a visit to Palestine and was able to contact some of the brethren serving the Lord In that land. It was easily seen that the Jews, of all people, are not hearkening to the message. Those interested In the truth are mainly Arabs. There are a few publishers in Palestine, eight now that are witnessing regularly. However, there are about 50 persons who are seeking after the Lord and studying their Bibles with Society publications. An excellent distribution of books and booklets was made, namely, 4,734. Many back-calls were made by the few publishers there, and the people of the land appreciate such efforts; but the work is not being done among the Jews who claim to be God’s chosen people. They are not hearkening to the Bible; their interests in Palestine are selfish. However, progress is being made. While the year report shows an average of 8 publishers, in August, 1947, 23 ministers of the gospel went forward to bring comfort to that strife-torn section of the world. We feel that a real groundwork has been laid for further increases in Palestine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Here is another country opened up to the message of the Kingdom during the 1947 service year. It was possible to send to this lovely country on the Pacific side of South America 8 hard-working missionaries. During the year 14 publishers joined them, and their report shows 22 servants, on the average, preaching the gospel each month. These publishers placed 10,625 books and booklets with the people while working 13,951 hours. It is good to see how hard these missionaries are working. They have averaged 174.1 hours per month during the time they have been in Peru, making an average of 69 back-calls and conducting 10 book studies. We feel sure that excellent progress will be made in the 1948 service year. All countries in South America now have Jehovah’s witnesses at work preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Tliis is another new field just opened up. For the first time the message of the Kingdom has gone into the Virgin Islands under direct supervision of the Society. Two Gilead-trained missionaries have organized the work there. The year’s report shows that there was an average of 17 publishers in the field, but at the close of the year, in August, a new peak of 29 publishers was reached. The missionaries are setting an excellent example in that they are averaging 193 hours per month in the field and conducting 139 back-calls and carrying on 22 book studies every month. These two workers have been well repaid in interest shown by the people who are now associated with them in the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the comparatively short period of time that these ministers of God have been in the Virgin Islands they have taken 766 subscriptions and have distributed 1,043 magazines, in addition to the books and booklets placed. This has been truly virgin territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This Spanish-speaking country at the southern tip of South America has made marvelous progress during the service year 1947. The publishers have increased from 489 to 679 on the average every month, reaching a new peak in August of 790 publishers. The splendid progress made in one year’s time is attributed to the circuit assembly activity and the servant to the brethren meetings with the companies regularly. Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina are concerning themselves with the preaching of the gospel. Knowing that they must sing praise unto all peoples, they have made the Kingdom work their chief business. They are not interested in the politics of the land, nor the influence of religion upon these politics; but they have made their big interest the Kingdom and its preaching. This is indicated by the fact that the brethren put in 184,925 hours and made 54,238 back-calls. The book studies have increased over last year, too, for now they are making 416. This is evidently all attributed to the good work and influence of the circuit assemblies, for this is the factor that the Branch servant, who makes the following report, stresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coming to the close of the service year is a joyful occasion for any Branch office. It affords a few moments to reflect and think of the Lord’s blessings through the year; and it certainly gives joy to the heart to refresh our minds on the manner in which he has blessed our efforts in his service, to his honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We, in this country have much to be thankful for. Besides having the privilege of another peak year in publishers, as the annual report shows, and also in hours as well as in book studies and back-calls, it seems that the newly interested ones get on to the work of witnessing much sooner than they used to. One thing that seems hard here is to increase in pioneers. In fact, in this latter case we are in the situation described at Acts 16:9. But we are hopeful that some day we shall get more pioneers and probably some Gilead graduates, for whom there is a good field here. We have many cities of fair size that are practically untouched, and others that have some persons interested who cannot be properly attended to for lack of capable brethren to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we now have two servants to the brethren, there are two districts; and so we divided the country in two, and therefore we have a better-organized work. The companies are better served and new ones are coming up, and, of course, that is very encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In May we held the first circuit assembly. As the city of Cordoba is the most centrally located in the district No. 1, we arranged to hold the first circuit assembly in that city. Cordoba is called “Argentine Rome” because of its having more churches than any other city in the country; and there is a Catholic university, and many monasteries. It is one of the oldest cities in the country, with many historic churches and other buildings dating back to the time of its colonization. They consider it the staunchest religious city in the country, and it is; but, with Jehovah’s help, the Society has there the second-largest company in Argentina. So it was thought to be the best place for us to start assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assembly was fixed as to program, and the 23rd, 24th and 25th of May were the three days set forth. The friends commenced to set placards on the posts and walls on Wednesday. Soon the police took them in because they did not have a permit to do so, as is required; and, as the placards advertised the main feature, the Sunday lecture, with the name of the speaker, the police wanted to know who that man was. They are very suspicious, but only on account of their politics. The district servant arrived Thursday morning, and he had to go immediately to the police headquarters. There he spoke to the officer in charge and the permit to advertise was given, so many thousands of advertisements were set out without any more interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came our second assembly, in circuit No. 2. This also was very well attended; and the newspapers inserted our program. A good witness was given and everybody was happy with the opportunity of meeting one another and making use of the great privilege with which Jehovah provided them, that of witnessing in his name and for the Kingdom. A feature that drew the people’s attention was the street work with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">jDespertad!</span><span class="font4"> which had never been carried out in that city of Bahia Blanca. Nearly all the publishers ran out of magazines in a few hours’ work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are ready for another year and will try our best with the many features and possibilities to increase in publishers and announce the King and his Theocratic Kingdom that is here, to the yet so many good souls that do not know anything about it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Many problems faced Jehovah’s witnesses the early part of this service year, but the majority of these were cleared up during the year, as is indicated by the Branch servant’s report. As the readers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> may remember, there has been a constant decline in the number of publishers in Australia for a number of years. Now, in the latter half of the 1947 service year, the number of brethren active in the field service has begun to climb again. The Kingdom interests are becoming paramount in the minds of more of the people of Australia. The faithful servants of God in Australia have continued through many years of trials and difficulties and have come out victorious. They are rejoicing now that the people of good-will are associating themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and are sharing in the grand privilege of promoting the Kingdom message in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The country has been divided into thirteen circuits, and this reorganization of the work in Australia has helped greatly. It is hoped that more servants to the brethren who have finished the course at Gilead can be sent to Australia. In addition to this, plans have been made to bring a number of Australian publishers to the United States to train them at the Watchtower Bible School, and probably some of these will return to help in the reorganizational work that is going on in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has a fine location for its Branch office in this country, and there is a very energetic family looking after the Kingdom interests there. We have a printing plant, but there was not a great deal printed therein this year because most of the literature used by the brethren was sent there from the United States. Some publications were produced for the brethren on the Fiji Islands, and there was also some literature printed in the Maori language for the publishers in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new Branch servant, who was appointed during the 1947 service year, reflects the feelings of the brethren in Australia in his report about the work there. Portions of it are herein reproduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “largest island and the smallest continent” well describes this vast land, famous for its kangaroos and koala bears. Although only 7J million people make their homes here, this island-continent is only a shade smaller in size than the United States. Here, too, Jehovah’s witnesses come from all walks of life, kindreds and tongues, and included among their numbers are quite a few of the Australian aborigines or natives, one of the oldest and most primitive races in the world. Irrespective of their location, color or language all of these consecrated servants of the Lord daily sound forth the life-giving call to the people, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previous annual reports of our Kingdom work have shown a decline in the number of publishers and activity; and this fact has given us great concern, especially when we read about the great increases evident in all the world. We entered the 1947 service year with questions like these in our minds: Would this year’s service show another falling off? Or would the Lord bless the work of his servants with an increase?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early reports indicated a continued drop, but then came the five-day “Glad Nations” Assembly held in the Sydney Town Hall on December 25-29. Would this Australasian convention mark a turning point in the general downward trend of Theocratic activity? By far the great majority of the publishers on the continent attended and some even came from New Zealand and Slam. It proved to be a joyful occasion indeed, with the attendance reaching 4,034 on Sunday during the public lecture “The Prince of Peace”. The joy and enthusiasm of the brethren knew no bounds at the release for the first time in Australia of the two very latest aids to study and gospel-preaching, the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> It was good, too, to have with us the two brothers from Gilead who had recently arrived from the United States. The assembly closed with the joyful announcement that Brother Knorr, the Society’s president, would visit us in March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Interference by the police with our placard witnessing in the streets, which interference had been going on for some months throughout the country, came to a climax during the assembly when thirteen brethren were arrested for wearing placards. While in jail one of the publishers witnessed for two hours to two of the arresting constables who showed interest in the Kingdom message. On Sunday they kept their promise and attended the public talk. The next day the thirteen brethren had their cases dismissed but the magistrate warned them not to engage in placard advertising again. The by-law used against them was enacted in 1901, so that horses would not be frightened by displayed placards. This regulation as well as others like it throughout the land cannot be challenged in higher law courts, since Australia has no bill of rights to protect its citizens. Time previously spent in placard witnessing is now devoted to house-to-house witnessing and back-call work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we returned to our homes from the “Glad Nations” Assembly all hoped that the many blessings received from the Lord would add the necessary impetus to our work so that it would show an increase. However, the increase anticipated did not come. What was the matter? Would it never come? But wait! What about that announcement made at the assembly about Brother Knorr’s coming visit? Would the Lord use this occasion to reveal what has been impeding the progress of the “expansion” work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few short weeks passed, bringing us to March 11, the day that Brother Knorr and his secretary, Brother Henschel, arrived. How glad we were to see them and to know they would be with us for more than two weeks! Almost immediately Brother Knorr and his traveling companions began visiting principal cities throughout Australia where arrangements had already been made for one- and two-day assemblies in six different centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was at these assemblies that we got the answers to our long-harbored questions about the work’s decline. Brother Knorr pointed out that the Society in Australia had in past years engaged in vast commercial activities and enterprises and that through such mixing in with the affairs of this world we had deviated from our commission to preach the gospel, thus incurring the Lord’s disfavor. Then Brother Knorr urged those assembled to publicly acknowledge the wrong before the Lord, asking His forgiveness. Upon his presentation of a resolution to that effect it was unanimously adopted by the brethren at all six assembly points. Unburdened hearts! Countenances radiating joy and gladness ! The occasion was a time of rejoicing such as had not been experienced in this land for many years as we anticipated for the days ahead Jehovah’s complete favor and blessing, a definite indication that we had received of the Lord’s forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides showing us the proper course to take before the Lord, Brother Knorr gave us much helpful counsel and advice about the work in the Branch office at Strathfield. A much-needed reorganization of the routine was accomplished so that the office and Bethel home would operate more efficiently and in line with the Brooklyn headquarters. The Bethel family thoroughly enjoyed the fellowship and the kind and helpful instructions of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almost Immediately after the president’s visit a nationwide increase in publishers and activity was noted. What a time of joy and gladness it has been during the past few months! We see in this increase positive evidence that the Lord has forgiven us for our past mistakes and transgressions. How blessed it is to see the Lord’s spirit once again flowing toward his organization in Australia! More than ever before we realize the great truthfulness of the prophet’s words at Zechariah 4:6 (A.S.V.) : “Not by might, nor by [human] power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.” Also we realize the absolute necessity of praying for and following the lead of that holy spirit daily, obeying the inspired Instruction, “Quench not the spirit.”—1 Thess. 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While this year’s average field-service report shows no increase over that of last year, still the figures for the past few months show that more publishers are reporting now than at any time during the last two and a half years. The average number of publishers for the last six months has been 3,433, which figure does give an increase over last year’s average of 3,294 publishers. Servant to the brethren reports show that new publishers are starting out in the service in almost all companies. One servant to the brethren says of his recent visit to a small company: “It is raining this afternoon, but the clouds did not frighten three new publishers from coming out in the work today.” Moreover, several companies have recently hit all-time peaks in publishers and hours. The company publishers are also conducting more book studies at present than at any time during the past two years. Back-calls too show an upward trend. With all this, it makes us wonder why a higher number are not engaging in the Lord’s pure worship each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An outstanding event during the year was the two-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign, during which time 4,935 new subscriptions were obtained. Then came the four-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">campaign. There were 2,413 new subscriptions obtained for this magazine, and also 2,804 more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions were taken. That made a total of 5,217 new subscriptions during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. As will be noted in the above figures, the people accept the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine much more readily than they do </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The reason is that religion is very unpopular with the majority and they find it difficult to see that religion and the Bible conflict. Thus they are skeptical of all literature dealing with the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are more than 100 isolated publishers reporting to us regularly. Arrangements have recently been made to have the servants to the brethren visit some of these many brethren scattered here and there away from companies. All those who have requested such a visit are being called on and helped to do the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lesser number of specials reporting than last year is partly due to the fact that several of these have since become servants to the brethren. Throughout the year the Australian Branch spent £4,626 from the “Good Hopes” fund to finance the field-service activity. The majority of this amount was used to aid the special pioneers, the rest being used to meet servant to the brethren, legal and miscellaneous expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding in the last few months has been the sudden rise in the number of book studies conducted by the special pioneers. During the first 9 months of the year their average number of studies per publisher was only 4.5. The last 3 months’ average shows 6 studies per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with a fervent prayer of thanksgiving to Jehovah that we end this service year. Words are truly inadequate to express the joy and peace within our hearts since our heavenly Father has begun to bless the work of our hands with an Increase. It has brought “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding”. (Phil. 4:7) Not with perplexity and misgivings, therefore, but with complete confidence, we enter into the new service year, realizing that “God is with us”. We are determined that, by his grace, we shall never again turn aside from or allow any part of Satan’s world to encroach upon our God-given commission to preach the gospel and thereby vitiate our service to him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>FUI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are several territories in the Far East that come under the jurisdiction of the Australian office. One of these is Fiji, another the Netherlands East Indies, as well as Siam, Singapore and the Malay States. The Fiji Islands are in the South Pacific and are populated by upward of 200,000 people, chiefly Fijians, Indians and Europeans. On one of the main islands of the eighty that are inhabited, namely, Viti Levu, there is a small group of Kingdom publishers who are located at the capital city of Suva. In 1946 two American graduates of Gilead en route to Australia had a short visit with the brethren at Suva. Later on Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel made a brief stop at the Fiji Islands while on their trip around the world. The brethren were then told that shortly two Gilead graduates would make Fiji their permanent home. These ministers, specially trained to carry on missionary activity, would associate themselves with the few publishers in the Fiji Islands and help them in every way possible. The report that follows comes from the brethren in Fiji.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although it is very interesting to witness among the humble and meek colored folk, yet it is difficult to make ourselves understood because of the language barrier and the lack of education on the part of the people. These difficulties are overcome to some extent by using the younger children to act as interpreters. All the children of the Fijians, Indians, Europeans and others learn English at the various schools that they attend. However, the problem is not entirely solved with this; for all the schools are missionary schools owned by the different religious systems, and that means that the minds of the children are filled with unscrip-tural religious doctrines. By working slowly and patiently with constant back-calls we are able by Jehovah’s grace to clear away the traditional man-made teachings and give the honest ones the pure truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had very good success placing literature in house-to-house witnessing, the field being practically virgin. The bulk of the placements have been among the colored people. In fact, many of these people come running up to us in the streets asking for more literature. They also call in at the Kingdom Hall asking especially for the Fijian booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Na Sereki E Na Vuravura Vou (Freedom in the New World).</span><span class="font4"> We have many interesting experiences as a result of these requests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early one morning a young Fijian .walked into the Kingdom Hall and asked for six Fijian booklets. After he had obtained them he made several inquiries about our work. He repeated this action three times in about a fortnight. Then one Sunday evening he called for more booklets on his way to the Methodist church. This was just before our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study; so one of the Fijian brethren entered into a conversation with him. We soon learned that our frequent caller was very much interested in the Kingdom message, and that he was sending many of the booklets to his folk back home in his native village. We invited him to our meetings, and since then he has attended many. He has also brought along seven others; so now we have a regular study with these truth-seeking ones using the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Na Sereki E Na Vuravura Vou.</span><span class="font4"> It is possible now to invite others whom we meet in the field work to this Fijian study at the company headquarters. This good-will person informed us that he wants to go back to his people and preach the truth to them. He has left his church and two of his friends are following him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our work is not without opposition. It comes chiefly from the religious element of the European population. Many show prejudice against the Watchtower Society, no doubt having in mind the ban that the Fijian government placed on our literature from 1940 to August, 1945. Although the proscription was eased and literature can be imported with the governor’s approval, still some try to use their influence against us. To illustrate, one of the Gilead graduates was witnessing in a local village recently and the archdeacon of the Anglican church threatened to get the government after him if he called on the people of his flock. The publisher went right ahead and enjoyed many interesting experiences, especially with the village schoolteacher. Another example: When three Gilead brethren stopped in Suva, not long ago, on their way to New Zealand, they waved their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazines so that we could recognize them. One of the Customs officials took a magazine away from one brother and told him that such publications were not allowed into the colony, which, of course, is an untruth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are having good results in the magazine street work. A good witness is given to the Kingdom, for much curiosity is aroused by the two “white” men “selling” magazines on tile street corners.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Internal strife troubles this territory, and fighting goes on between the Indonesians and the Dutch. This makes the Lord’s service difficult to engage in, but a few publishers there, 11 in number, are doing good work. Studies are conducted regularly in the Malay language. A Dutch study has also been arranged for those reading that language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the lack of literature it was impossible to do much work during the past year. Recently, however, some literature arrived in Java which had been sent to the brethren there from Holland. No large stocks can come into the country, due to shipping conditions. However, the brethren are now going from door to door with what little literature they have and beginning Bible studies. The back-call work has started and book studies are now being conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the publishers reports that a Eurasian woman who took some booklets and copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has become very much interested. She was formerly a Catholic, but now she is anxious to study the books in the Dutch language. While a study was being carried on with this lady, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">person who understands Malay better made inquiry and asked if a study could not also be started with her. The interest is there. It just takes time to find it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>SIAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This Is one of the many countries that was visited by the president of the Society on his world tour. It is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> peaceful country; however, all around it there is trouble. China is embroiled in war. The Netherlands East Indies is patrolled by armed police. We read of assassinations of ministers and high government officials in Burma and of the never-ending turmoil and rioting in India. Amidst all this trouble in the Ear East, Siam remains peaceful. She has even allowed tens of thousands of Chinese to flee into her country to get away from the crimes and calamities and internal warfare of China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although Siam has been spared from these disasters up to the present time, she is burdened with religious customs, suffering, poverty and disease. While the lowly people of the land work diligently and hard so that they might reap some fruits from their labors, organized gangs rob them of what little they have saved. The havoc wrought in other countries startles the world and is widely publicized, but not so with the little troubles in Siam, which do not make the front pages of the newspapers, although they certainly affect the lives of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As one travels through the land he makes the same observations that the apostle Paul did while preaching the gospel in the market places of Athens, namely, that in every way the people are very religious and superstitious and they follow their objects of worship blindly and willingly. It is our privilege to make known to them the truth as to what is the pure and undeflled worship of the true and living God, Jehovah, who does not dwell in shrines, wats, or temples made by men’s hands; but, says the scripture, “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our service year opened with a constant stream of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font4">news from the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly at Cleveland, at which assembly Siam was represented by our depot servant The pictures, large and small, as well as the copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> and the new books released at this assembly, made us shout for joy, and enabled us to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">rich portion of the feast which our heavenly Father had arranged for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also have received regular supplies of literature from headquarters throughout the year. The shipment of Chinese publications has been a great help to the publishers, as a good percentage of the population of Siam consists of Chinese, and we had for a long time been practically without literature in this language. With the arrival of the new mimeograph machine, stencils and paper, we were able to start again duplicating </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> In Siamese. Since January we have made 200 copies of each issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The English booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of God Is Nigh&quot;</span><span class="font4"> was translated into Siamese toward the beginning of the year and 5,000 copies were printed. However, the high cost of printing, which has to be done by outside firms, made it impossible for us to continue printing literature in this land. Here again the Lord has opened the way for us, and in the future all our needs for Siamese literature will be supplied by the Society’s printing plants, either in Australia or in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main event by far during the year was the visit of the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, and his secretary, Brother Henschel, who were with us from April 8 to 12 Inclusive. This visit of our dear brethren proved to be a very pleasant one for all of us and we felt greatly refreshed by their fellowship which the great Theocrat had provided for us. The visit was marked by the thrilling event of the first convention ever held in the history of the Lord’s people in Siam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A good witness was given to the citizens of Bangkok through the advertising of the public lecture “The Joy of All the People”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the lecture two of the local newspapers, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chart Thai </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Liberte</span><span class="font4"> published false reports about the speech. They stated that Brother Knorr, in the course of the talk, had greatly defamed the Buddhist religion and that because of this many people had run away from the lecture hall, refusing to listen to the remainder of the talk. Such action brought the C.I.D. officers to the Society’s depot, who asked for a copy of the lecture. Upon receiving the same and perusing its contents they immediately decided that no such defamation of the Buddhist religion had been made by the speaker. They then advised the acting depot servant to see the editors of the above-named newspapers and ask them to stop misrepresenting the facts, and If they would not stop publishing false reports, they, the C.I.D. officers, would take action against these editors. The result was that these editors did apologize for misinforming the Bangkok citizens and for the injustice done to Brother Knorr and the Society. They stated that they had relied entirely upon the information of the Buddhist priest and their correspondent. One of the articles appearing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Liberte</span><span class="font4"> newspaper criticizing Brother Knorr was written by a Buddhist priest. He later willingly apologized for the untruths appearing in the article, stating that for his information he had relied wholly upon an earlier article in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chart Thai</span><span class="font4"> newspaper. Several of the newspapers published the Society's answer to the criticism, and thus another good witness to the people was given by this means. Thus the Devil’s attempt to counteract the good effects of the public lecture served only to bring about an even greater spreading of the truth than was originally anticipated!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was during the visit of Brother Knorr that arrangements were made to get the work better organized, and the news that the Bangkok depot would become a Branch on September 1 brought much joy to all of us at the Bethel home.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the war years the work of Jehovah’s witnesses came to a standstill in Singapore and the Malay States. Many of the interested ones were taken to prison, and others fled from the country. Even at the end of hostilities, after the people were liberated from Japanese rule, there were still no regular meetings conducted nor was service work carried on, due to the lack of organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In March, 1947, the brethren remaining were privileged to have a visit from Brothers Knorr and Henschel, who visited Singapore on their Far Eastern tour. Shortly thereafter, in April, two graduates from Gilead arrived in Singapore to take up missionary work. Reorganization of the work began immediately with the gathering of the brethren for the Memorial celebration on April 6, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study being resumed on the same evening. Other company meetings were started, including the Theocratic ministry school. The attendance has gradually increased as newly interested ones have begun to attend. The attendance increased from an average of 8 in April and May to 16 In August. A company was organized, and the number of publishers has more than doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The group represents many different nationalities, such as Chinese, Ceylonese, Tamil, Eurasian, and European, which is a good representation of Singapore’s cosmopolitan population. English is widely spoken, so all the studies are conducted in the English language. Malay, however, is the language most widely used by the native population, and for this reason the two Gilead brethren are attending Malay classes to equip themselves for witnessing among these people. Further, a booklet has been translated into the Malay tongue and will shortly be used in the great educational work in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There are many persons of good-will here who are hungering for the truth. Due to the overcrowded living conditions, many of these ‘sheep’ are literally hidden in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kampongs</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">attaps</span><span class="font4"> (thatched shacks). A pioneer brother who was working such an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">attap</span><span class="font4"> compound was informed by the occupants of a hut at the entrance that none of these people could read and besides they were all Buddhists and Moslems. Nevertheless the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kampong</span><span class="font4"> was worked and a Eurasian lady contacted who manifested good Interest. A back-call was made on her and her husband and it was found that they both were well educated and lived in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">attap </span><span class="font4">because of the housing shortage. Both the message and the method of study impressed them very much, and it was not long till he began to speak to his neighbors and relatives. Now there is a group of seven attending this study. Among these is a Malay Moslem who began manifesting interest since being shown the difference between imitation Christianity and true Christianity. To find some of these ‘sheep’ requires real ‘hunting and fishing’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One good-will person who received some of the publications from his daughter in Batavia during the war was so impressed with the message that he immediately set about to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses. He visited the various Bible societies in town but none of them were Jehovah’s witnesses and none could give him any Information as to their whereabouts. Finally one of the pioneers recently called on him at his home in a congested Chinese area. Now he is rejoicing with Jehovah’s people as he feeds at the Lord’s table with us.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is thrilling to see the zeal of the Austrian brethren, which they have expressed in the form of hours devoted to the King and the Kingdom. In the year 1946 the publishers devoted 34,600 hours to witnessing; whereas in the last service year the number of hours spent in the field increased to 162,383. These figures themselves bespeak the zeal shown by our brethren in this war-torn country. Even though many of them spent years in concentration camps and lost their homes and all of their property, even though they have no food and very little clothing, still they are pressing on, knowing that there is only one hope for the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the government has aided all political prisoners of the Nazi organization, it has not gone out of its way to assist Jehovah’s witnesses who took a definite stand against Nazi rule. However, they didn’t go to concentration camps for any personal gain they might get later; they went there because they were standing for truth and righteousness and were neutral toward the politics and religious activities of the old world. They are still of the same mind and rejoice that they have the opportunity of singing the praises of Jehovah God unto all the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant and his wife had the blessed privileges of attending Gilead, and the convention at Cleveland, and of spending a number of months in the Brooklyn Bethel home and factory, where they received special training before returning to Austria. Following is the report of the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a real joy to give this report of the activity of Jehovah’s people in this country. It shows very great progress in all the features of the work. Most certainly Jehovah has blessed his people. In spite of the difficulties, which are still numerous, the brethren went forward. The conditions are far from normal. That the food situation is bad is generally known, but there is also no possibility to buy a suit or a pair of shoes. So you can imagine how glad the brethren were when they received the many gift boxes from their brethren in America and Switzerland last year. Indeed, some confessed that it was only by the generosity of these brethren that they could go out in the work. There are other difficulties, but I shall not talk about these things that you can read in every newspaper; I should like to talk about better things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Till April, 1947, the office work was done in the kitchen of brethren. Then we moved into a school building which was partly destroyed by bombs. We occupy a big room which for the present suits our purpose quite well. But we cannot stay here for good, and it is not really what we permanently need. As you already gave us permission to look for something better, a brother who is an architect made it his business to search for rooms so that we can store our books which we are sure will come some day! and where the office work can be done, and also some rooms be had to live in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am glad to report that the Society is now registered again as a Branch of the Brooklyn office, under the same name and under the same conditions as before we were banned. That is, of course, a help to carry out the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great event of the past year was the convention. When we were able to announce It, we expected quite a number, but we did not expect to see a thousand brethren in Vienna. We knew all about the hardships the brethren would have to overcome. Only the other day, when I went to visit some of the companies, I had to go to the station a day before, to get a permit for traveling. So many people were waiting that, although I was at the station already at 7 o’clock, I had to line up till 1:30 p.m.; and this is only a small example of how much time has to be spent during which nothing is accomplished. But as we had the joy to announce that a special representative from headquarters, the vice-president Brother Covington, would attend the assembly, everybody did his utmost to overcome any handicap. It was a long time since there was a personal link between headquarters in Brooklyn and Austria. You, dear Brother Knorr, were the last visitor from there, and many brethren still remember the happy time when you came to the office and the convention in Vienna in 1933. Then came the many years of the Nazi occupation when no official meetings could be held. So you can imagine how glad the brethren were to have again, after fourteen years, a special representative of the Society in their midst. The convention was a really joyful and blessed gathering. As we were not able to rent a bigger hall, the public talk had to be given In a hall which seats little more than 1,000 people. So we were not able to make public announcements, but only back-calls were invited; with the result that, all together, the brethren included, 1,700 were assembled long before the beginning. The police had to close the hall because it was overcrowded, and many could not get in. On Sunday morning an immersion service was arranged, and 131 symbolized their consecration to Jehovah God. Brother Covington’s talks were not only instructive and helpful, but also extremely encouraging for the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although we are very short of literature, on the whole the brethren made the best of it. The distribution of books shows an increase of more than 6,000 over last year. Of course, a great part of these are Bibles. And the booklets show an increase of more than 100,000 over last year. They consist mainly of the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Olad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the Peoples”,</span><span class="font4"> for both of which you had arranged that they were sent to us from Switzerland. There is a real shortage of the latest books, but we are glad to say that Switzerland will print 10,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You I-’ree&quot;</span><span class="font4"> for us which will be used for the arrangement of book studies only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It fills the heart with gladness that the expansion of true worship of the Most High God can also be seen in this country. While last year the Lord’s people were organized in 52 groups, this year there are 90 groups where the message of God’s kingdom is held high. These brethren appreciate so much when I tell them of my visits at Gilead and the work in Brooklyn and the States. They have read about it, but it helps them to hear it all described and explained by somebody who was there. The brethren, athough some of them are living high up in the mountains or in isolated valleys, feel closely united witli the brethren in the other parts of the world. They put forth every effort to follow faithfully the organization instructions; even those who are very simple do their utmost to learn the best way to serve In full harmony with the instructions coming from the center of the Lord's organization here on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last month we had in Klagenfurt the first circuit assembly for Carinthia. All the companies were very well represented. The brethren showed a good spirit; and they worked very harmoniously together. There was also an immersion service, and 55 brethren symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Covington announced at the convention that there is now the possibility of entering the full-time service. We are glad to say that so far 11 have already started. May Jehovah graciously give his blessing on this so very important part of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Brother Knorr, I should like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to you for the many privileges Sister Voigt and I enjoyed last year, attending Gilead School and the Cleveland convention, and working for three months in the different departments in Brooklyn. There is abundant proof that all this is a great help for me in carrying out the work here in the same way as it is done in the States. I also want to express my thankfulness for all the help the Society has extended this country which made it possible to carry out the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic organization in Belgium is more stable, healthy, and more prosperous than ever before. This is due to a better organization. Belgium finds itself in a better condition than most of its European neighbors. It has recovered economically quite rapidly. Clothing is no longer rationed and larger quantities of food are available now. Prices are rising, however; but as far as living conditions are concerned, these are much better than the conditions still to be found in countries harder hit by the war. Because of Belgium’s present prosperity, many foreigners have been attracted to the country to work in the mines and find employment in other industries. Due to this influx of people from other countries it is necessary for the Branch office of the Society to have literature in 20 different languages so that these people can be served with the truth in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the Catholic organization collaborated with the Nazis during the war, still the Catholic priests of Belgium have great influence over the people, and they warn their parishioners that it is dangerous to read the Bible. The majority of the people continue on in darkness, but some are awakening to the fact that the Catholic church is just giving them husks and no real food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant, a Gilead graduate, is glad to be in Belgium and work with the brethren there. If is report follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dominant religion of Belgium is Roman Catholic, the Protestant and Jewish sects forming a very small minority. The land is famous for its ancient religious edifices, which attract thousands of tourists each year. There are many religious holidays, which are celebrated with ceremonies and processions. Often the people take advantage of these holidays to hold their popular festivals and the day is spent in singing and dancing in the streets and elsewhere. It is easy to see that the object of these religious festivals is to keep the people satisfied with religion, and many spend their lives looking forward from one festival to another. However, this is not the case with all, as is shown by the following experience reported by a pioneer. He writes: “Being stationed at my post with my books Sunday morning, a procession passed, and just before me many persons were prostrating themselves before the procession. I noticed a man who was not doing as the others. This interested me, so I approached and asked him why he was not doing as the others. He answered that his conscience would not permit him to do it. This, of course, gave me the opportunity to give him a good testimony, which he accepted with much pleasure. He then took 2 books, 4 booklets and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Eight days later he came to find me and took 3 books and 4 booklets. The following day he came again to get books in German and also gave a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> He is already announcing the good news to his acquaintances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When those of good-will learn the wonderful truths concerning Jehovah’s kingdom their joy knows no bounds. Recently a man who lives in an isolated territory, which is worked by a pioneer, received some of the literature and immediately accepted the truth. He was so overjoyed that he telephoned the Branch office to tell us about it. He realized the necessity of witnessing, so he immediately set himself to work; but, not being acquainted with the organization, he naturally did not know how to go about the work. He bought an amplifying system and installed it in front of his house. Each day he read from the Society’s publications over his loud-speaker system so that his neighbors could hear the good news. Soon there were complaints and the police told him that he would have to cease his broadcasting because he was disturbing the peace. He wrote us for advice and we advised him to comply with the order of the police. We told him that in a few days we would send someone to show him how to properly carry on the work. The following week the servant to the brethren was able to visit him. The servant to the brethren explained how to do the work, and he immediately joined with him in the work. They worked together for three days. He was pleased to learn how to witness properly. It was explained to him how he would be able to put his amplification system to good use also. The new publisher was very grateful for this Theocratic instruction. He opened his house for a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtmver</span><span class="font4"> study and other meetings, and now a small group meets there regularly. He has also provided lodging for some vacation pioneers who are working that territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past service year we had three conventions in Belgium. The first was our “Glad Nations” Assembly, which followed the great international assembly by this name at Cleveland. It was a three-day convention held at Brussels from the 4th to the 6th of October. The talks that were presented were from the Cleveland assembly. This convention was conducted in the two languages of Belgium, that Is, French and Netherlandish. On Sunday the public talk “The Prince of Peace” was delivered to an audience of 1,700. The model service meeting, Theocratic ministry school and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study were much appreciated by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event of the year was the visit of Brothers Franz and Suiter, from Brooklyn headquarters, during the month of June. During this visit two conventions were held: one for the Netherlandish-speaking brethren at Antwerp and one for the French-speaking at Brussels. From the discourses of these two representatives of the governing body of the Lord’s earthly organization, the brethren were enabled to get a clearer understanding of how the Lord’s organization operates than ever before. It was emphasized that the Theocratic organization cannot be nationalistic, because Jehovah does not respect persons. When the question was put to them by Brother Franz, as to the country to which they looked to locate the governing body of the Lord’s organization, they were all of one accord that they do not look to any government on earth, not even to political America, though It happens that at the present time the governing body of the earthly organization of Jehovah is found within the political boundaries of that country. Yes, they look to the Lord’s Theocratic organization for instructions, and that Theocratic organization is located on God’s footstool.—Isa. 66:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brothers Suiter and Franz also brought messages of love to the Belgian witnesses from their fellow servants of many nations. This enabled them to understand more deeply how God’s people are united in the bonds of an unselfish devotion which lifts them up above all the petty quarrels and selfish desires which divide the nations of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three weeks after the visit of Brothers Suiter and Franz, we had the privilege of being visited by Brothers Knorr and Henschel here at the Branch office. This visit permitted Brother Knorr to inspect the Society’s property at Brussels which he had not yet seen, and to discuss many problems with the Branch servant relative to the pushing of the expansion. As a result many “bottlenecks” were eliminated and the way was prepared to push the advance of true worship with greater vigor. Brothers Knorr and Henschel were able to speak to the two units of the Brussels company during their visit; which was very encouraging to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a climax to terminate this most joyous of all service years came our first circuit assembly, at La Louviere. It was most enthusiastically supported by the publishers. During the last six months there was an average of 295 publishers for this particular circuit and on Sunday at the assembly 263 reported; which shows that the biggest part of the publishers in the circuit were present. All servants in the circuit except two were present. There were 36 persons immersed, and 485 attended the public meeting. All were bubbling over with enthusiasm. The circuit activity meeting was specially interesting and instructive, and was well attended, the servants and publishers alike taking part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From every point of view the service year just ended has been the best yet for Belgium. Although the expansion may not have been as great as in some other countries, yet the report shows that we have expanded; and that is encouraging. Much has been accomplished in laying the groundwork for further expansion; the cords of the tent have been lengthened and the stakes strengthened. (Isa. 54:2) Last year 1,099 attended the Memorial. This year there were 1,525 who attended; which shows an Increase of almost 500. During the coming year many of these persons should realize their privilege and be counted among those- of all nations who are praising Jehovah. So it is with joyful anticipation that we look forward to the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The government of Belgium has control of a large territory in Africa called the Belgian Congo. There are two publishers of the Kingdom living in that territory now, and they have been sending in some reports to the office in Brussels. This vast territory we hope will open up some day so that the gospel of the Kingdom can be preached there. The Catholic Hierarchy, which has for many years tried to control Belgium completely, has a great influence on the population of the Belgian Congo. It is reported that they dislike Jehovah’s witnesses very much and are trying to keep them out of that country; but, if the Lord wants the truth to go in there, his spirit will so direct and nothing can stop it. We sincerely hope that the two witnesses of Jehovah now in the Belgian Congo will find much Interest and that their efforts at witnessing will be blessed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Includes that portion of the wooded highlands called the Ardennes, which lies to the southeast of Belgium. This small state, about the size of Rhode Island in the United States, comes under the jurisdiction of the Belgian office. The population of Luxembourg is about 300,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to certain laws in the country, it is impossible for the brethren to go from door to door with literature, placing it as they travel; but they are able to witness with the Bible and later on make back-calls and conduct book studies. The literature can then be left with the people who are interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over a period of years there had not been much of an increase in publishers in this land; however, the servants of the Lord have worked faithfully and now Jehovah is giving the increase. The report for 1937 shows that there were 29 brethren in the country at that time, and in 1946 the report showed an average of 30 publishers a month during the year. However, the report for this year shows a good increase. They have averaged 47 publishers a month and have attained a peak of 59 publishers during the year just ended. Thus the Lord has richly blessed the efforts of his people in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the brethren have succeeded In incorporating a Society which is called “The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society” and which has been a great help to them in getting the work properly recognized before the authorities. They are now pushing the work more boldly and have organized several public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following experiences sent in by the depot servant will give an idea of what witnessing is often like in the Grand Duchy. “In a village a sister was going from house to house, giving the witness of the Kingdom. Soon a group of children was following her and yelling, ‘Go away bibel-forscher; get out of our village, old witch.’ The sister continued her work, not becoming irritated. The group of children increased, and began throwing stones at the sister, who still continued her way. The village people were at the windows and doors watching the stoning, the greater part of them rejoicing over their brats, and thus showing their good education. Finally the publisher gained entrance at one of the houses, and the lady of this house observed that her daughter was also one of the ‘defenders of the church’. The mother called the daughter and gave her the punishment that she deserved. ‘Hold on there,’ said the sister. ‘It is not the children who are responsible for this. They are only in the service of their educators.’ ‘Who told you to do that?’ the mother asked her child. ‘The teacher,’ was the reply. ‘She told us to chase this woman from our village.’ ‘We expect this,’ said the sister, ‘because the Lord has already said, at John 15: 20: “If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” We cannot, therefore, be surprised because of this opposition, since the truth is not for those persons, but for men of good-will, who rejoice over the good news. It is for this reason that we will continue regardless of everything.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the Society held the first real convention ever to be held in Luxembourg. It was the privilege of Brothers Franz and Suiter to serve on the program of this assembly. As can well be imagined, it was a time of great joy for the Luxembourg brethren. They were thankful for the Theocratic instruction and encouragement received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three companies of Luxembourg are included in a circuit with some Belgian companies across the border, and are served regularly by one of the Belgian servants to the brethren. They have not yet had a circuit assembly, but there will be one for their circuit soon, to which they are all looking forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for Luxembourg shows that Jehovah’s servants there have worked well in his service, and that he has in turn blessed them with a fine increase. It is with joy that the publishers look forward to another year of activity in his service, and are determined to push the advance of true worship in this country, during the year ahead, more vigorously than ever before. They are convinced that if they do their part, then Jehovah will give the increase that he has promised.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country has known little about the truth, because it has been only recently that publishers of the Kingdom have entered into the land to make the proclamation. The principal activity is carried on in La Paz, the capital city, where the first two graduates of Gilead to enter the country began their service. There are many obstacles to meet in this country due to the fact that many of the natives of the country are Indians who have received no education. The only way that the message can be presented to them is by word of mouth, as they are unable to read and study for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, for the present the work is chiefly confined to the cities of La Paz and Cochabamba. There is plenty of room in Bolivia for more publishers, and the Society hopes to send some there during the 1948 service year. At the present time there is an average of 16 publishers, and the peak reached during the year was 26. The Branch servant sent in an interesting report, part of which is published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the course of the year our book studies turned out some really zealous publishers. Two of the pioneer sisters started a book study in English with a lady who had been to the States for a time and who knows English quite well. A young university student became interested in learning English. However, he soon became much more interested in the truth than in English. At his first service meeting during the September-October campaign for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions he wanted sample copies of the magazine and the book to go along, so that he could make “propaganda” among his fellow students. At that time he became disgusted with the students because of their indifference. In the December booklet campaign he placed many booklets among them, however. His first day out in the door-to-door work, at the second door called on, he decided it would be better if he took the opposite side of the street alone. The pioneer taking him out gave him his own bag of books, retaining only one for himself. The young publisher soon got out of sight, working his side of the street, and returning on part of the other to meet the pioneer. Running over with joy and having placed all of the books in the bag, he said, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Caramha!</span><span class="font4"> We will have to take more books along next time,” and also commented on the joy and freedom one experiences in the service. Since then he continues full of zeal for the Kingdom. During the magazine campaign of 1947 he took up vacation pioneer service, as the university turns out from March to May. In March he first set a quota for himself at 20 subscriptions for the month, but, as he soon surpassed that, he set it at 40, and at the end of the month he had obtained 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One who can now give testimony to the Indians who speak the Aymarti dialect is a devoted Indian brother who has come into the truth quite recently as a result of a book study held with him for not so long a period. He has shown much zeal in all features of the work, but recently he has been arranging for back-calls with all kinds of people that come to his barbershop, and then he and a pioneer brother look these up and make calls on them. In the door-to-door work the Indians and mestizos (mixed race) listen to him more readily than to the American brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Oruro a young brother who learned the truth through a few </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and book studies he attended now makes visits to his home town, a small village, some way out of Oruro on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Altiplano,</span><span class="font4"> Bolivia’s high plateau, and always takes a quantity of literature, which he places with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in Bolivia are very grateful to Jehovah God for making the necessary provisions to preach glad tidings to the meek of this large inland nation and for now bringing forth fruit for their labor. The good seed is being sown by printed page and by word of mouth and now the Kingdom message is being heralded forth for the first time in other new tongues. We are rejoicing to see the response of this nation to the invitation “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations” and look forward to a greater praising of his name in the year to come.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This great country sprawls over a territory as vast as that from Florida’s tip to Hudson Bay and from Philadelphia to Salt Lake City. Its 45,000,000 inhabitants are divided among 20 states and 7 territories. The larger part of the population is scattered along the coast. Jehovah’s witnesses, being few in number, have a great problem in reaching all of the people of Brazil, and constantly the call is for more publishers. A new peak was reached in the number of servants to the Lord in Brazil during the service year, when 786 witnesses reported. Quite a few brethren from Gilead have entered the service in Brazil, and we hope to send more to open up new fields through the missionary activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant and his wife, along with other Brazilians, attended the assembly in Cleveland and also had the opportunity of getting special instruction at the Society’s headquarters at Brooklyn before returning to Brazil. They were happy to get back and to push ahead with the great expansion work that is going on throughout all the earth. The Branch servant’s report this year is very interesting, and parts of it are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year opened with the echoes of the “Glad Nations” Assembly in our hearts stirring all to action. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">magazine took the place of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese and a two-month campaign brought in 2,740 new subscriptions, the best subscription campaign to that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From October 17 to 20 the Brazilian “Glad Nations” Assembly was held in Sao Paulo, the most joyful of all conventions. The Teachers’ Institute Center was used for all meetings except the public lecture, “The Prince of Peace,” on Sunday afternoon, for which the Municipal Theater, Sao Paulo’s best, was engaged. The attendance of 500 on the first day rose to 814 on Saturday night. The public meeting was well advertised by radio and sound-car announcements, 2,000 placards, and 150,000 handbills. One of the principal daily newspapers gave a good two-column news item. The tireless efforts of the 297 publishers who participated in the field service house-to-house, with magazines and handbills and other means of advertising, were well repaid, for on Sunday afternoon, half an hour before the lecture began, the hall was packed out with 1,700 persons, Brazil’s largest attendance by far. Eighty-three were immersed on Sunday in the Eden Swimming Pool near the Assembly auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November a Gilead graduate took up the southern circuit as servant to the brethren, covering the states of Sao Paulo, Parand, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Both he and the brethren whom he visited report many blessings from his visit with them, helping them to better their organized service for The Theocracy. On his return to Bethel after six months’ absence, it is noted that he is speaking the language quite fluently. He encountered some hardships and difficulties In his travels, especially In the Interior, where accommodations, it found, are primitive. Upon his visit to a person of good-will in a town in Santa Catarina, he accepted the only accommodation this friend, a police sergeant, could offer, and slept with him in the jail. But these experiences were as nothing compared with the blessings which Jehovah poured out for him in his ministrations to the “sheep”. On one of his long journeys by omnibus, two fellow travelers were Pentecostal missionaries going to the same town as he, to meet in a convention of that sect, that is, they were Pentecostal missionaries at the beginning of the trip. The servant soon engaged them in conversation and they began a Scriptural discussion which ended in their attending the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses instead of the Pentecostal meetings when they reached their journey’s end. They were baptized, remained with the brethren to learn the Theocratic way of preaching the gospel, returned by way of Sao Paulo to associate with the organized company there and learn still more, then to their home in the interior of the state of SSo Paulo, where they are faithfully carrying on the witness work, having already added another publisher to their ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February, five girls graduated from Gilead arrived, and remained in Rio de Janeiro for a few weeks before joining a brother and a sister in the missionary home in Sao Paulo, the first in this territory. Quickly overcoming the difficulties of a strange tongue, different customs and climate, they are going ahead nicely and finding exceeding gladness in the work of disclpling the many nations in Brazil. One sister already has 13 studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In April the second home was established in Rio de Janeiro for the three brothers who had arrived the previous July and who had been working at the Branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last two Gilead graduates to arrive came by boat to Rio de Janeiro in May and went immediately to their territory in Salvador, Bahia, where there now is a third home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador are the largest organized groups of witnesses, and the presence in these cities of the Gilead-trained missionaries, eagerly looked for and so much desired, is expected to greatly aid in the expansion work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the second week-end of March, Brazil’s first circuit assembly was held in Assis, in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo. This was a great blessing to many of the brethren who are scattered In small groups or isolated in that part of the territory. Considerable interest of the “other sheep” was shown and the companies have profited by the Theocratic instructions received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year was crowned by two more assemblies, one in Rio de Janeiro in July, the other in Silo Paulo in August. The Rio de Janeiro assembly was outstandingly joyous. At the meeting of the servants it was noteworthy that all the problems and questions bore on the point of “How can I as a servant improve my Theocratic service to the brethren?” rather than the attitude of “How can we servants make the publishers do the work?” There was no evidence of friction in the companies nor between the companies. The love that was manifested by the brethren in all companies for each other anil their consideration of the newcomers in their midst was noted by these people. The Lord of the harvest has great blessings for his servants who faithfully continue to bid all the nations “Praise Jehovah !”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are 400,000 inhabitants in the poor colony of British Guiana, a part of the British Empire. The only real hope that can be held out to the people is that given them by Jehovah’s witnesses, who are trying to show them that the only hope of the world is God’s kingdom. A marvelous increase has taken place in British Guiana during the past year, as the report shows. The clergy have been forced to notice the Lord’s blessing on the Watch Tower Society, and, to counteract the growth of the work, are now instructing their people to burn the Society’s books and to refuse to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses and their comforting message. But their talk will never stop the onward flow of truth. Even some of the East Indians are separating themselves from the Mohammedan and Hindu beliefs and are listening to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the outstanding things in the report from British Guiana is the tremendous increase in the number of back-calls being made, namely, 18,040 during the year. The brethren see the need, too, of conducting book studies, and 260 of these are being handled regularly by the publishers each week. Interesting high lights of the year are set out in the Branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There Is little opportunity for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> readers to visit British Guiana, so it is our annual privilege to relay to you all the report of the Kingdom work in this small South American colony. Continuing where the 1946 account left off, we held our anticipated convention, October 4-6. This was the big event of the past service year—a year of expansion and advancing of true worship in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Kingdom Hall in Georgetown was the center of much activity for the three convention days. Printed letters one foot high strung from post to post along the front of our upstairs hall announced: “Jehovah’s witnesses Assembly.” Slxty-nine publishers marched throughout the city on Saturday with placards advertising the public lecture, “The Prince of Peace.” Our efforts were well rewarded with a packed-out Town Hall audience of 541 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days later in October four Gilead graduates arrived to join the one already here. These five brethren have worked diligently during the year to aid the local witnesses in becoming more efficient in the service. Despite a scarcity of houses in Georgetown, a missionary home was established in a desirable location, and the Gilead graduates are content with their assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November a special representative from the Society’s headquarters, Brother Steelman, visited the companies in British Guiana in his tour of the Caribbean branches. His two months’ stay helped to establish a new peak of 144 publishers for December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1947 began with exceedingly dry weather, developing into one of the longest droughts in British Guiana’s history. We took advantage of this by holding many public lectures, totaling 116 for the year, to compare with 35 for the previous twelve months. Several local brothers, trained in Theocratic ministry school, joined the two Gilead graduates in delivering these talks at Georgetown and in villages along each side of the Demerara river, where three more companies can be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">June rains did not dampen the zeal of Kingdom publishers, as a new high was attained, 146. Then July saw 154 out in service, and August became the third consecutive highest month, with a grand total of 185 “turning in the report”. Thus at the end of this service year the number of witnesses in British Guiana has doubled!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enough of figures. Now what has been the attitude of the religious organizations to this growth of the Lord’s work in British Guiana? Certainly these groups have felt the heat of the witnesses’ activity, as evidenced by their opposition in the smaller villages especially. At several places where pioneers have been assigned, the preachers warn their parishioners from pulpit and street corner about “false prophets”. At New Amsterdam, a village up the eastern coast, a Pilgrim Holiness parson stood under a street light one Saturday evening berating Jehovah’s witnesses before 100 or more persons, lie stated that “there are false prophets going around the town telling the people that there is no hell, but there are plenty of scriptures to prove that there is”. Yet he failed to show his audience any of these scriptures 1 Then the witnesses gave their answer to this man by their house-to-house coverage of New Amsterdam the next week during the visit of the servant to the brethren. All week they stressed the fact that “there is a hell, and it is the grave”. It was noted that fully nine-tenths of the people agreed with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The past twelve months saw many visible evidences of the Lord’s rich blessing upon us. We rejoice that one of our local brothers had the privilege of attending the Los Angeles convention. As the new year begins we eagerly await his return with firsthand reports of the “All Nations Expansion” Assembly, as well as our second circuit assembly for 1947, and many other unforeseen blessings that are in store for all who love and serve Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The good work of preaching the gospel continues in this land. The field service report tells a very interesting story of finding new interest and shows, too, how this new interest readily takes hold of this message of truth, soon becoming ministers of the gospel. Up until recently the main activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in British Honduras was in the principal city, Belize; but now there are sufficient witnesses to arrange for some to go out into other parts of the territory. As the work begins to branch out, more opposition appears, especially from the religious folk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though they had an average of only 13 publishers last year, the brethren were not hesitant in putting into effect all of the organization instructions such as the Theocratic ministry school, public meetings, advertising with placards and the holding of circuit assemblies. All of these instructions were followed out, and the Lord blessed their efforts. Instead of having 13 publishers now, there is an average of 38, with a peak of 50. You will enjoy reading the Branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although no one from British Honduras had the privilege of attending the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly, held in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, U. S. A., in 1946, yet we were ‘glad with his people’ as reports of the convention came through the mails. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> almost made us feel we were there in attendance as we read the various discourses and viewed the wonderful pictures of the various features of the glad event. But this was not to be the sum of our joy. Shortly after the convention we had further occasion to be glad. Four more missionaries were scheduled to come directly to British Honduras from the convention. They brought further details of the convention, along with some of the gladness which they still had from having attended in person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even before this glad event in Cleveland arrived in August, word from the president’s office in Brooklyn had reached us that we were to have a “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly here in Belize, the capital of British Honduras. This was to be one of a series of smaller conventions to be held in Mexico and throughout Central America after the one in Cleveland. Brother Knorr was sending his special representative in the person of Brother T. H. Siebenlist and Sister Siebenlist, who had been called to attend the convention in Cleveland and then to receive some special training at Bethel. This was due to further reflect the gladness from the convention held in U. S. A. We were all well pleased by the evident results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was to follow close at the heel of the colony’s big day of celebration, the 10th of September. Our assembly was to be on the 13th, 14th and 15th of September. We had speculated beforehand on what the results would be at such a time, but nothing can stop the onward march of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization. And this time it was a literal march. Placards were used here during this assembly for the first time in advertising the talks. The talk scheduled to be delivered as the high light of the assembly was the one given at Cleveland, “The Prince of Peace.” The brethren did literally march; all over town they went, distributing the handbills inviting the people to hear the subject discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For days, yes even for weeks, we heard the people say as we passed, “Hear ‘The Prince of Peace’.” Some of the native brethren were at first reluctant at taking part in this feature of advertising, but when they once got into the swing of it they thoroughly enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first two days of the assembly did not look promising, as it rained off and on, but w<sup>y</sup>e continued advertising the talk, which was slated for Sunday at 3 p.m. The brethren had many blessed experiences in this new feature of the work, and were now assembled to hear that which they were sure would well repay them for all the efforts they had made to advertise it. As is usually the case here in this small country, very few were present at the beginning of the talk, but continued to stream in all during the first half of the discourse until they filled all the seats and some had to stand. The final count was 160.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the service year in British Honduras there was only one company in the whole colony, which had set its quota of publishers at 15. In the first month of the year we had gone well over the quota, chalking up 24 publishers in September. In December we followed the suggestion as set out in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> that is, inviting all our study attendants to take part in booklet distribution. Much to our joy we found at the end of December we scored a new peak of publishers, company publishers soaring to the high of 40!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, keeping In step with the Theocratic organization in all parts of the earth, arrangements were made for a circuit assembly, to be held in connection with the celebration of the Memorial of Christ’s death, on the week-end of April 6. This proved to be the Lord’s arrangement, as was borne out by the results of the assembly. In this month of April, no doubt due to the assembly, we reached another peak of publishers, this time going to 50, including all publishers in British Honduras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the Lord provided the local company with a Kingdom Hall, which has had its good effect on the work. Good benches were provided, too, and all other things necessary, sufficient to take care of both the regular company meetings and at least a part of the public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world may put their trust and hope in the U.N., but we will continue to look to Jehovah and his Theocracy for protection and salvation. The brethren all seem determined to push on in this postwar era, come what may, until all nations shall be found praising Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This report includes England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Channel Islands. The country of Eire, or Ireland, also comes under the direction of the London Branch office, but in view of the fact that it is an independent country a separate report is given. Within the bounds of the British Isles there are now approximately 45,000,000 people. Most of the territory is closely populated, with the people living in towns. Over these people hang clouds that are low and very dark; there is a crisis in England. ‘Men’s hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.’ From one end of the British Isles to the other new restrictions and regulations are being placed upon the people. The conditions today are comparable with those of the war, if not worse. The war left the country in a very poor condition; and now, with severe measures’ being placed upon the people, they should really be aroused to look to the Lord’s Word for help rather than to the promises of men. The British people have had their troubles, like every other people and nation; and their only hope, whether they know it or not, is God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to note an increase in the work done by the British'brethren. They are accepting their responsibilities before the Lord; and, by God’s grace, they will continue to sing praises unto the Lord in all the nations. The report of the Branch servant is very interesting, and we can catch the spirit of the British brethren in the report which follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We In Britain have had abundant evidence of Jehovah’s direction of our affairs, and therefore to him is due all praise for the safeguarding of the Kingdom interests and for graciously committing to us the privilege of carrying his message to the people of this land. In some respects the year has been an exceptional one. The recovery from the effects of World War II has been slow. Added to this, the terrible winter of 1946-47 will long be remembered as the worst in living memory. So severe were the wintry conditions that whole areas of the country were inaccessible for weeks at a time. This was followed by floods which resulted in the low-lying districts’ being completely inundated for two or three months’ duration. The press reports tell of over 3,000,000 sheep lost in the snow and the floods. These things are mentioned here because these conditions, together with sickness arising out of them, seriously affected the Kingdom work in the first half of the service year. But we are glad to report that a wonderful recovery took place in the remaining months of the year. A new peak of publishers was attained in April, and this was outstripped with a new all-time peak of 13,670 during August, the final month of the service year. This is an increase of 786 over our peak of publishers for the previous year. This steady rise in number of publishers in the latter part of the year gives evidence of being maintained during 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British brethren gladly recognize Jehovah’s direction of his work through his visible organization, the Society, under the leadership of Christ Jesus, and today there is with him “a band of men, whose hearts God had touched”. (1 Sam. 10:26) Through the steadfast service of such many of the “other sheep” have been brought into the fold in response to the Good Shepherd’s voice; these are now feasting with us in the rich pastures of Jehovah’s providing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been a great help to us to have the magazines for street work. We again received bulk supplies during the year, and this has enabled the publishers to again appear on the streets. Many are the happy experiences encountered by the publishers while witnessing on the sidewalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting work has been kept up during the year. Both indoors and out in the open spaces the Kingdom message has been heralded far and wide. Over 13,000,000 handbills have been distributed and over 9,700 meetings held. There can be no doubt that these meetings and the activities in connection therewith have done much to keep the Kingdom truths before the people. During April alone 1,786 meetings were held in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers have enjoyed the most blessed of all privileges in being in the forefront of the Lord’s army of Kingdom publishers. True, they have endured many hardships, but their joys have been boundless, for this is testified to by many letters received telling of their appreciation of their privileges. It is a joy to report that many brethren are now entering the pioneer ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the writing of this report the number of pioneers is rising again to the 1,000 mark. We have hopes that many more who can will yet see their privilege of freeing themselves from the ties of this old world and living in full enjoyment of life as full-time Kingdom- publishers. We rejoice that over twenty pioneers from the British field have been called to Gilead and have now passed on to service in foreign fields. We have them in remembrance before the Lord as they carry on their work in distant lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The provision made by the Society for the pioneers to meet the rising costs of living has been a gracious arrangement, and as one expressed it, “Just like the Lord to meet the need at the right time.” Where possible, we have assigned the special pioneers to the outlying territories, and good work is being done in opening up new companies. Special pioneers in Northern Ireland have met up with bitter opposition. The hatred of the Protestant organizations toward the truth is as deep as that of the Roman Catholics. Two pioneers write, “Within two weeks both local Protestant newspapers have given five inches of publicity, but the people of good-will are disgusted because the individual did not give his name, merely signing himself ‘Evangelist’. There is a good response to the message and ne have been blessed by helping new publishers into the field.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ontstanding event of the year was the “Praising Nations” Assembly at Earls Court, London. This was by far the largest assembly ever held in this country. We prayed earnestly that the Lord would direct all things according to his sovereign will, and this was realized in full measure. From the time of the first inquiries for the auditorium until the end of the assembly itself, there was clear evidence that the Lord was directing the issue to his praise. One very marked evidence of the Lord’s blessing was seen in the rooming arrangements for the numbers coming into London. The housing problem is acute, but, despite that fact, in record time and to the utter amazement of so many, over 3,000 people in the city opened their homes to the brethren; and it can be recorded that much interest was aroused through the brethren staying in the homes. Many interesting experiences have followed and numbers of book studies established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The presence of yourself and the other brethren from the Brooklyn Office was a real joy to the more than 13,000 brethren and good-will interest present. The discourses were greatly appreciated. It was truly inspiring to witness the close attention given at the public address, “Permanent Governor of All Nations,” when 18,000 were in attendance. Never have we witnessed such an intensely quiet audience with periodic outbursts of applauding. There were roughly about 5,000 of the public present. Had it not been for the strike of the London bus service on the same day, when 80 percent of the busses were taken out of the service, there can be no doubt that the attendance would have been much larger. It so happened that the day of the public discourse was proclaimed by the king as a national day of prayer, and special services were arranged in St. Paul’s Cathedral, with the king and the queen and the prime minister in attendance. The press reports that only 2,000 were present whereas over 5,000 were expected. The following press report is significant :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“For four days last week there was held at Earls Court what was called the Theocratic Assembly. . . . the public was invited to hear an address on the ‘Permanent Governor of All Nations’, and, judging by the crowds attracted . . . the people of London, groping in darkness, and apt to become a prey to those who offer an easy solution to their troubles, are seeking guidance. Last Sunday, in any case, was devoted by the churches to a ‘Call to Prayer’ so that the people if they were really seeking guidance had no excuse for being diverted to seek it from Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The joys of the convention were many. The detailed accounts of the travels in Europe and the Far East by the brethren brought real joy to the conventioners. What a joy it was to learn of the marvelous increase in the work in Germany despite the havoc wrought by war! Then, too, there were greetings received by telegram from distant parts of the earth. The fine weather lasted throughout the assembly period, and this enabled more than 4,000 to engage in street advertising with the placards in all the busy thoroughfares of the city. Also the joy of seeing 420 step forward as candidates for immersion and entering more fully into the blessings of the Kingdom. It was overwhelmingly agreed by all that this was the greatest and the grandest convention we have ever had in Britain, and we believe that its results will be felt throughout the field, as Indeed we have seen already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lightning tour of the British field by Brothers Franz and Suiter was much appreciated. Meetings were held in centers convenient to the brethren, and it was good to see them make the effort to attend. Many are the expressions of gratitude for the ministrations of these brothers. The reminder both at the convention and during these visits that there are no national barriers between the Lord’s people but that all are one, serving the same great cause and joined with their brethren in all other lands, has had the effect of binding the Lord’s people into a closer unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems quite appropriate again to mention the real profit derived from the Ministry Course. Those who have followed the course consistently have received much valuable help in fitting them for a fuller service. The ‘Written Reviews’ have proved an inestimable blessing. Many brethren while not attaining the full marks agree that they are better equipped with a knowledge of the Bible than formerly. That is the spirit of the brethren generally. Undoubtedly, the fundamental facts concerning the Bible itself with the added proof of its authenticity will do much to equip the zealous publisher to be furnished for “every good work”. All this provision from the Lord for our good calls for deep gratitude, and all the evidence shows that the brethren in Britain have much appreciated it. This together with so much of the good tilings from the Lord’s table constantly confirms our confidence in the “faithful and wise servant” and binds us still more closely to the one organization of the Lord’s choosing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren at Bethel have had much joy in serving their brethren in the field. They have been kept busy throughout the year. The large volume of new subscriptions entailing the dispatch of the first few issues from this office has kept us going continually. The printery has produced an output of nearly 18,000,000 pieces, consisting of booklets, placards, handbills, etc. The printing of booklets here and by outside printers amounted to well over 2,000,000. There has been a steady increase in the number of letters received and dealt with, the number for the year being 72,310. The family have been happy to share with their brethren in the field work as they have opportunity, particularly at the week-ends. We greatly enjoyed having you with us together with the other brothers from headquarters. We are thankful for the unity that exists among us as we work together to the one common end—the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coming months will demonstrate to what extent the Lord’s people will be affected by the new regulations. One thing is certain, they know that no man-made remedies can bring lasting benefits to the people. We have been informed over the radio by a government spokesman that we must expect restrictions in respect to food, clothing and other commodities much more severe than anything experienced so far. We look to Jehovah to direct our course as we meet up with the problems which will surely come, but we do set with bright hope for the future while our hands are full with his service. There are multitudes of people in this land who must yet be reached with the Kingdom message. In the language of the Resolution supported by all at the London convention we say. “With a greater sense of our responsibility, we are resolved to press forward the preaching of the Kingdom with increased zeal and alertness, so that the Kingdom work in this land may prosper as never before.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Next to Vatican City itself, probably Ireland is influenced more by the Catholic priests than any other place on earth. The northern part of Ireland, known as Ulster, comes under the British Crown. Twenty-six counties in the southern part of Ireland are known as Eire. Eire has its own government and is no longer tied to the British Crown, except that it is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Approximately 95 percent of the people are Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the strong influence of the priests over the people, the message of the Kingdom is reaching some of them. The Lord’s command is, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations”; and that would include Ireland. We feel sure that there are some people in this land who want to praise the Lord and gain life eternal. The pioneers in Ireland are having a very interesting time, although they experience many difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time in the last twenty years the Kingdom publishers have been badly treated in Eire. Open attacks were made upon them, and their literature burned in public, and they were driven from the country by mobs. But of recent years more progress has been made. In fact, during the past year or two the work has progressed steadily and, although still small, there is a band of fifteen pioneers and three companies in the country. In Dublin the company has an average of 19 publishers for the year. The other two companies, at Slane and Sligo, are quite small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers have continued their work against great odds. In the city of Cork a band of pioneers have kept up their efforts with good results. A report from them says: “As the figures show, many people in Cork have been willing to take the literature. A good number of such people have allowed us to make several back-calls on them; a few have appreciated the discussions and are now having book studies. After the encouraging attendance of 23 persons of good-will at a public lecture by the servant to the brethren, our next plans are to give a series of six lectures, beginning next month.” Later their report says: “At the last two series we had an attendance of 18 persons at each meeting. It is remarkable that different ones attend each time in the main. If this continues next week, we shall have had at least fifty different persons attending the series.” There are good prospects of a company being formed in Cork in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometime last year efforts were made to get pioneers established at Limerick, a city of about 40,000 population. Their own efforts were soon cut short, for throughout the city they were boycotted and forced to leave through lack of accommodation. Priestly fear prevented some persons’ providing them with rooms who otherwise would have done so. However, these pioneers faithfully recorded the results of their work and during the past year two young brothers were sent to Limerick. They have held on grimly to their assignment, remaining in their rooms only a few days and being forced to move elsewhere. One of these writes: “I have enclosed two newspaper cuttings which I am sure will be of interest to you; they have caused quite a stir and many honest people have been prompted to speak on our behalf. Our work in Limerick is producing really wonderful results, and we have met some very sincere God-fearing people of good-will. I am sure that if we are only permitted to stay in the city we will see some great things.” Extracts from the newspaper reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■‘Doing Evil Work - Base Activities in Limerick - Limerick city is at the moment sheltering two preachers over from Kent going to Kileely selling and giving books against the Catholic church. A vast sum of money comes from America to finance these two vampires, who attend no church, but say they are messengers or witnesses of Jehovah and trying to disturb the minds of the good people of the city of St. Mun-chin and St. Ita.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another pioneer writes: “It seems the priest got to know where I was, undergoing treatment in hospital. He was in a great rage, shaking all over with temper. He first asked me where I was from and then raged at me, saying I was going about with scurrilous literature, etc., that I was to leave hospital that day and that I was to get out of town, and if I didn’t he would get his mob to kick me out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still another writes: “The parish priest raved around the town, walking into homes and burning the literature; entering the schools to shame the children whose parents had taken the literature at the doors; telling the children that Bible men had been run out of town with picks and shovels, also making the people with whom the pioneer stayed confess that they had sinned in harboring a ‘communist’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has always been so in Eire, that the priests have held great power over the people, who are only too ready to follow their bidding to take mob action against any and all who do not fall into line with the “church”. The Irish people are kindly and ever ready to show good-will to strangers, but the moment the priest starts to incite them, they take action that knows no bounds and they will stop at nothing to carry out his wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visit of Brother Suiter to Dublin in June was much appreciated. The brethren from all over Eire came in to Dublin on that occasion and the meetings resulted in much encouragement to the brethren to carry on their work. More pioneers are scheduled for Eire and we hope to see further progress during the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for the year shows good increase over the previous year, the results being over 100 percent increase in most features. We look for far greater things for Eire in the year before us while we rejoice with those who are now leading the way in that priest-ridden land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The location of the Branch office is in Port of Spain, Trinidad, but the territory under the Branch is scattered throughout the Caribbean sea. The British West Indies Branch territory is made up entirely of a chain of small islands which stretch in a semicircle from Trinidad at the south end near the coast of Venezuela northward for 800 miles to Puerto Rico, where it ends with the British Virgin Islands. The islands of Trinidad and Barbados have the largest populations, and scattered throughout all these islands we will find 1,133,000 people. It is the Society’s hope that we can send more Gilead graduates to help this Branch in its organizational work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Splendid work has been done in the past year, and we believe a similar activity will continue during the service year 1948. The servant to the brethren problem is a big one here. Brother Steelman, who is serving all of the companies throughout the Caribbean area, served the British West Indies Branch with very good effects. The report which follows shows what splendid work the graduates from Gilead have accomplished along with the local publishers, who are truly zealous for the Kingdom. They have one thing in mind, that is, praising the Lord. The Branch servant’s report is very interesting, and excerpts therefrom are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time spent in praising Jehovah passes swiftly by and leaves no regret when it is past Instead comes the satisfying joy of expansion and the joy of having had a share in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">such advancement of Kingdom interests. So it has been here in the British West Indies Branch during the past year. As the year progressed we rejoiced to read the accounts in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and in convention reports of the growth of the various Branches in other parts of the earth. At the same time we were experiencing a similar increase as more and more heeded the gracious invitation to join in praising Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the end of the year 31 companies were on the list and scattered over nine of the islands, which was an increase of 0 over the previous year. The brethren of the companies are poor in this world’s goods but have the durable treasure of serving God. That they appreciate this treasure is shown by the field-service report for the year. Remarkable increases are noticed in all features of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beginning with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign and continuing on to the four-month subscription campaign with both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions and individual magazine distribution increased more and more. We hoped to get 1,000 subscriptions during the four months. As week after week went by and more subscriptions continued to come in, it began to look as though our hope would be realized. It was gratifying at the end of the campaign to count 622 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toiver</span><span class="font4"> and 502 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. What an increase over the total of 410 subscriptions for the campaign last year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Turning now to the expansion of the number of publishers, we can trace much of this to the work of the Gilead graduates who have been assigned to work with this Branch. The three that were sent to Barbados continued to do a good work in aiding the brethren there to become more efficient publishers of the Kingdom message. Better organization of the companies was effected by these three serving them as servants to the brethren. Two new companies were organized. The aid thus rendered and the bringing in of the good-will interest built up through back-calls and book studies caused the number of publishers on the island to expand from 137 to 286. In Bridgetown alone a peak of 178 was reached. Now the missionary home in Barbados has been closed, its work being done, but the stimulating effect on the work is still felt and continues to spur the brethren on in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were happy in Trinidad when on October 4 the plane swooped down with its 8 Gilead graduates for Port of Spain. They had been long awaited, and now they were here to work out from the Branch home. A short period of getting settled and acclimated and then they were out in the field going from door to door, making back-calls, conducting book studies, supporting public meetings, and, most important, taking the local publishers and persons from back-calls along personally in the field to give them Theocratic instruction in properly praising Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Results were not long in showing up. Publishers began to take more interest in giving a good witness and not just showing some pretty Bible books or some magazines. They began to equip themselves with bookbags and supplies of literature to have on hand and place with the people in door-to-door work. The importance of making back-calls on those taking literature was more fully appreciated, with the result that back-calls and book studies grew in number. This could end in nothing else than more publishers; it did. Last October, when the Gilead graduates arrived, there were 53 publishers for that month in Port of Spain. In August at the end of the year there were 159, a 200 percent increase! What about back-calls? book studies? Yes, they were the same. From 78 back-calls in October there was an expansion to 618 in August. Studies increased from 13 to 81. Surely here is abundant evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the provision to send Gilead brethren to other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These brethren have had many experiences while in the service of our Master. One related the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After having about five studies in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’, </span><span class="font4">Mrs.—■ decided to come to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, then all the rest of the meetings. Her hubby and self study from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font4"> book almost every night. He never came with her to the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One Sunday night she came to the study, and on arrival home he was not there and did not come until late that night. Upon his return she learned that he had gone to a friend and had taken the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Truth’</span><span class="font4"> book, question booklet and Bible and had several hours of study with this friend, having a time of his life. The next week he came to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">study and enjoyed it very much.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another had this experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One night I was hurrying to get home, so decided I would take a short cut through the cemetery. This has high walls all around with gates on all sides of it. As I walked along a young woman approached me calling me by name. I didn’t know her, so she explained she was from the country and had met me previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Her father-in-law had died, so they had come in to bury him; she had come ahead of the rest. Seeing he had died so suddenly they had not time in which to get anyone; so she wondered if I could say a few words. By this time the rest had arrived ; so with my Bible I said a few words ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another important factor in unifying and expanding the work was the sending of Brother Steelman to act as temporary servant to the brethren and to report on the needs of the Branch. From the time lie began to serve the companies in January there were remarkable increases in the companies he served. Invariably during the month of his visit to a company there would be a peak of publishers for that company which often was double or even triple the previous peak. This was accomplished by making a determined effort to contact all the irregular and inactive associated on the first day of the visit and arranging for them, to go out in the service with him or some good publisher during the rest of the week. It was found that many went out in the field but did not report their time. At one company, several times while the servant to the brethren was witnessing from house to house someone would greet him, “Good morning, brother.” To which he would respond, “Good morning, are you a publisher?” “Yes, brother.” “Do you turn in reports?” “No, brother.” By getting all the reports and taking out the Inactive and irregular brethren he was able to have the company report 61 for that month instead of the previous 12 or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some who have entered the pioneer field have done so at an early date after contacting the truth. One young brother learned of the truth by attending a public meeting series last fall. He began to attend the company meetings in November and shortly afterward went out in the service. He heeded the invitation of the special letters sent out by the Society to the companies in the spring and applied for pioneer service. Now he is an energetic and capable pioneer who is doing especially well in back-call activity. These hard-working pioneers together with the conscientious company publishers have contributed their share to the Increase of Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So ends our report for the year. We have enjoyed many blessings at the hands of Jehovah and look forward to future privileges of service and increase. We, also, hope that it will be possible for you to serve this Branch and aid us to more effectively praise our God “whose name alone Is Jehovah”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada have taken an all-out stand for the Kingdom. This they did many years ago. When the crisis of World War II struck the Canadian government and their people, a ban was enforced upon Jehovah’s witnesses; but this did not stop the preaching of the Kingdom message there. While it was unlawful to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, they, nevertheless, faithfully carried on. During these years of war the work increased tremendously in that land and more publishers associated themselves with the true gospel-preachers. Since the war like increases have been made because of the faithfulness on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today they are fighting for freedom with the same zeal and energy that they showed during the war years, and they know that Jehovah God is backing them up. While they have been reinstated as good citizens of Canada, they are not recognized as such in the province of Quebec, where, by the Lord’s grace, they have been trying to help the people get an understanding of the Bible. The Catholics there have objected strenuously to the people’s reading the Bible or anything that pertains to it. The year-long battle in Quebec, which has involved all of Jehovah’s witnesses in the country of Canada, has.been a most interesting one. The report by the Branch servant which follows deals particularly with this interesting affair, for it has become a national issue. The issue is freedom of worship. The busy witnesses in Canada have been richly blessed in finding many people of good-will who have now associated themselves with the Lord’s organization and are proclaiming the ‘good news unto all the nations’. Those who fight for righteousness will never fail, and the Lord’s blessing will go with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praising the name of Jehovah in the Canadian field during this past year has yielded rich increase and brought much gladness to all of the Kingdom ministers. The expansion work is on, and the year has been filled with the marvelous exhibitions of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and mercy, and now as the totals for all fields of service are gathered together we cannot help but express with deepest gratitude: “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness!”—a year of Intense activity, of unremitting fight against great odds, and yet of forward movement and advance of the true worship of Jehovah. On high the message has been lifted and into the limelight Jehovah’s devoted people have stepped, and, though at times perils have beset us, yet always we have been confident that ‘he hath made our feet like hind’s feet’, so that we have been sure of footing and had great peace as our minds were stayed on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The key position in the Lord’s organization is that of the Kingdom publisher, and therefore we are delighted to note that there has been a 10-percent increase in the average monthly number of publishers. The peak of 12,093 reached in January was the highest ever for Canada. The zeal and enthusiasm of all these ministers of God have certainly made an impression on the country during the year. More than 2,000,000 hours spent in various features of field service has meant an increase of more than 200,000 over last year’s total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The true worship of Jehovah was due to be expanded in Quebec and the Maritime provinces. It was therefore determined to move all the special publishers from various parts of this farspread land to the east, and a call was also sent to our general pioneers inviting them to volunteer for a share in this trek to Quebec and points east. There are 127 fulltime ministers now preaching in Quebec province, 85 of these being special pioneers. Other pioneer brethren continue to make request for assignment on this eastern front, volunteering to study the French language and so push the advance of true worship in darkest Quebec. This movement has taken much time, effort and money, but we are sure the Lord’s direction is with us. Grateful are we to the Most High God for causing his faithful children to respond and travel such great distances. More full-time preachers are required. The number could easily be trebled and still there would be a cry for ‘more laborers, for the fields are white to harvest’. Especially is this true in the concentrated populations of the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special campaigns set for the year were partially broken into through emergency service and special work, which had to be arranged due to hatred and opposition from the province of Quebec, where the brethren were being sorely tried. Your visit last November to Montreal, Quebec’s largest city, to comfort, strengthen and direct as to further activity was the springboard from which the greatest battle for truth in Quebec was launched. So great had been the opposition by the Hierarchy in that province that the time had certainly come for her exposure, and hence publication of the leaflet “Quebec’s Burning Hate, for God, and Christ and Freedom!” In a lightning, 16-day campaign this leaflet In English, French and Ukrainian was distributed from coast to coast. The Hierarchy set up a howl of rage and counter-attacked; not with denial of the disgraceful account of her actions, but with her favorite weapons of slander, lies, violence and the pressure of Quebec’s corrupt political machine upon the law-enforcement bodies. In 16 dajs 260 arrests were made in the Montreal area though not one arrest was made in any other part of Canada. On December 4, 1946, Maurice Duplessis, Fascist-minded premier of Quebec and tool of the ‘Church’, hurled a boomerang that devastated his own ranks when he deliberately ruined the prosperous business of one of Jehovah’s witnesses whose only offense was that of supplying bail for his brethren. This abuse of political authority for such obvious “religious” persecution aroused the ire of freedomloving Canadians throughout the entire country. It brought nation-wide publicity and many expressions were made championing the cause of Jehovah’s witnesses and denouncing his actions. Protest meetings were held throughout the country by various organizations; resolutions passed and forwarded to the Duplessis government; newspaper writers branded Duplessis “a sawdust Caesar”, a “minor-league Franco”, as “the focal point of fascism”, etc. One paper remarked, “The cause of Jehovah’s witnesses has aroused the Canadian people more than anything else for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opposers of truth in Quebec were showing by their bitterness that the title “Quebec’s Burning Hate, for God and Christ and Freedom” was an understatement. It became necessary in our fight for freedom of worship to make public her insane persecution of the Lord’s children, that it might be a testimony against herself before all liberty-loving people. The second leaflet, “Quebec, You Have Failed Your People!” was distributed country-wide in three languages, and completed in frigid January weather. There were arrests daily (as many as thirty thrown into jail in one day) sometimes for no greater offense than boarding a streetcar. Court appearances were both during day and at night. To get bail, arrange release and keep track of the hundreds of charges was a heavy burden. At the same time appeal cases and other special legal proceedings were being conducted. During the four months, November to February, there were 843 arrests, bringing the total cases pending in the courts to more than 1,300. The majority of the arrests were on trumped-up charges of “peddling”, etc. So enraged were the opposers that 64 brethren were charged with “sedition” and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“seditious conspiracy”. This serious charge is not new to Jehovah’s witnesses, for It was leveled against us prior to World War II. Indeed the apostle Paul was charged with being “a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews”. Our Princely Leader, Christ Jesus, also was charged with sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This fierce, mad rush of the enemy did not shake or move the true ministers of the Most High. They stood their ground and endured hardness as good soldiers. Again the forces of righteousness were called in to support the fight, and on March 2 every company in the land put on or supported a special public lecture: “The Fight for Freedom of Worship in Quebec! Awake Canadians to the Facts!” The facts concerning our fight were there given. The eyes of the nation were on us. Practically every newspaper In the country was taking up the issue. People of good-will were having their eyes opened while religionists fumed at the tremendous favorable publicity we were receiving. Many of the newspapers in Quebec were “frothing at the mouth”, but still the fight went on. The March 2 lectures inaugurated a nationwide campaign inviting the people of Canada to petition the government for a Bill of Rights guaranteeing freedom of speech and freedom of worship. This was part of the fight. Civil rights in this country are enjoyed only by tolerance or sufferance. They are not guaranteed. A declaration of rights would make it possible to carry our fight for freedom of worship farther, and certainly for a longer period of time. The petition campaign was carried on through the month of March amidst severe beiow-zero weather. Over 500,000 signatures were obtained—the largest petition ever presented to the Canadian Parliament. As a result of the nation-wide publicity of this petition and the thousands of letters to members of Parliament calling for a Bill of Rights, the government finally set up a committee to consider such a measure. Part of the difficulty has been the lack of suitable appeal to the higher courts. In Quebec there is no appeal from the decision of the municipal Recorder’s courts. Efforts are being made to broaden the right of appeal to the Supreme Court. Thus the national issue of civil liberties raised by the faithful course of Jehovah’s witnesses has caused thousands of freedom-loving Canadians to realize the inadequacy of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also we have utilized every known legal remedy to get the cases into the higher courts, and many practically unknown methods. Denied protection by one court, we have appealed further. Recourse has even been sought to the Supreme Court of Canada, but we were Informed they did not have jurisdiction to hear our cases. Back again into the Recorder’s courts our cases have landed. However, the zeal of the Lord’s people is undiminished, and the fight starts all over again. Actions, appeals, writs, motions and special remedies have been employed in every case that came to trial. No cases have been abandoned until every avenue of defense was exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The intense hatred of some of the officials in Quebec broke out in open opposition in the shape of a special provincial law empowering local municipalities to prohibit distribution of literature. A penalty of three months or one hundred dollars cash could be imposed for distributing one handbill. It was thought that now they had Jehovah’s witnesses in the bag, and they would swoop down like vultures on the apparently helpless brethren. But we were directed otherwise, and the enemy was outmaneuvered. The ministers in Quebec were instructed to go from house to house preaching the gospel by word of mouth, and using the Bible, where possible the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span><span class="font4"> Now the brethren are spending their full time preaching the gospel instead of languishing in Quebec’s filthy jails. Under the Lord’s direction we shall be victorious, for no power can successfully withstand tile Almighty. Our fight for freedom to worship Jehovah in this country is by no means over. Indeed it is only beginning. The totalitarian spirit is here and will produce further schemes in endeavoring to stop the forward march of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fighters for true worship have been greatly strengthened in Quebec by the return of many of our pioneer ministers who have recently received training at Gilead School, including a groundwork in the French language. Actually 62 Canadian brethren graduated from the 9th class, of which number 3 were immediately assigned outside of Canada, 12 were appointed as servants to the brethren in Canada, and the remainder returned to Quebec and district, some of which territories have never received a proper witness. A further group of 22 brethren from Canada is now in training in the 10th class. We rejoice that so many of our brethren are thus equipped for service anywhere in the world-wide field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord will give strength unto his people and bless all with peace. Happy is our lot and grateful are we to abide under the shadow of his wings and continue by his grace to receive his mercy and lovingkindness I Therefore we will gratefully continue to praise and exalt his holy name among the people of this country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the present time there are 19 missionaries in Chile who were sent there from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. These brethren are in different cities, namely, Concepcion, Santiago and Valparaiso; and one brother is traveling as a servant to the brethren. Their influence has been felt in Chile. They have been working in close co-operation with the company publishers, and a splendid increase has been effected during the 1947 service year. There are now 137 publishers working regularly in the field, and a peak was reached in August of 175. Eleven companies are organized throughout the land; but, even with this fine increase, the call comes for more workers. The expansion work is going forward in Chile, and some people of good-will in that nation are being comforted and are praising the Lord. The Branch servant sets out a very interesting report; and, although not all of it can be published in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> excerpts are taken therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of praising Jehovah is indeed a blessed one. It is blessed because it honors the One worthy of all praise; because it causes others righteously disposed to unite their voices in the praising work; and because it is a guarantee of life to the one doing the praising. No greater privilege, therefore, could present itself to Jehovah’s witnesses and their faithful companions on earth today than to fulfill Jehovah’s command to “praise Jehovah, all ye nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">World-wide we behold the Lord’s organization breaking forth to the right and left in fulfillment of the prophecies long ago written. To our brethren in lands where the Kingdom publishers number into the thousands our report will seem small indeed. We barely average as many publishers as a good-sized company In the United States. Yet the same commandments and task of preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” for a witness to the nations confronts this small group of Kingdom publishers as in lands where they are blessed with many more laborers. It is with particular joy to us, therefore, that we are able to contribute to the worldwide expansion by the spirit of the Lord operating through his willing servants in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two years ago there was an average of 65 publishers in the field. Now we can report an average of 137 for the year and a peak of 175 attained in August. This manifests Jehovah’s blessing and calls for greater activity in appreciation thereof. Having this evidence of approval from our God we take it as the “go-ahead” signal for the entrant new year of service, determined by his grace to aid many more of good-will to come forth and praise Jehovah’s name during the succeeding twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is now a little over two years since the first graduates of the Watchtower School of Gilead in New York arrived in this land. During the year their ranks were strengthened by the arrival of more of these specially trained ministers. These brethren are now located and working in the three largest and most important cities in Chile. In spite of language and other barriers, which are gradually being overcome as these brethren make themselves “Chilenos” for the sake of the gospel, they are doing the greater part of the service work. In this they have the faithful co-operation of the native brethren and the newer publishers who have seen their zeal for the Lord and have joined wholeheartedly in the work of praising Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Daily the special pioneers have interesting experiences in the field. They can’t help but have these joyful encounters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer made a back-call on a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer </span><span class="font4">subscriber a few months back. The man also had the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth” </span><span class="font4">book but had given up studying it as he couldn’t understand it. The study arrangement was introduced to him and readily accepted. Leaving unexpectedly on a trip, he arranged for the publisher to continue the study with his two daughters of 16 and 18 years of age. Incidentally, although Catholic he had never wanted his daughters to confess to a priest. Eager to learn the truth, these young girls advanced rapidly and in the course of a few brief weeks were attending headquarters’ meetings. Usually the next step of getting these new ones into the service is a big one. Not so in this case. Hearing the announcement about Sunday group witnessing one of the girls went directly to the publisher instructing her and asked to accompany her in the service the following Sunday. Now both girls are regular publishers. The mother has since become very much interested and it appears that the entire family may yet be publishers of the only good news, the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four principal campaigns were carried out during the year. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign in September and October was the first of these, resulting in 297 new subscriptions. Next followed the great </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign of 1947. In comparison with the 1946 campaign’s 513 subscriptions, 710 were taken during 1947. Following closely in the wake of April’s special activity, which was one of our best months, came a special campaign in this land: the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Be Olad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font4"> to men of influence. The brethren pitched in gladly, serving doctors, lawyers, embassies, police, school and government officials. In fifteen days our entire stock of some 5,000 booklets was exhausted. We could reach only some of these persons, but a good witness was given. Perhaps later on we may see the effects of this campaign. The encounters and experiences were interesting. The consul of Mexico, for example, upon identifying the work with Jehovah’s witnesses accepted the booklet and stated: “Thank you very much. I shall be glad to read It and pass it along to someone else.” The minister of Turkey wanted to know more about Jehovah’s witnesses. He had read about them in the States. The publisher was only too glad to aid by making a back-call and placing with him </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”. </span><span class="font4">The results of the special three-bound-book campaign which concluded our service year are gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the heat of the political crisis a bill is diabolically hatched and shoved before Congress to make Catholic religious teaching compulsory In all public schools—the first step in a desperate attempt to regain the foothold lost some years back and enslave the masses once more under the rule of church and state. Fortunately there are still some freedom-loving people here as elsewhere. The bill has been the center of heated discussion from all sides. A courageous and clear-cut editorial in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Noticias Grdficas</span><span class="font4"> of September 15, 1947, a Santiago daily, took up the fight and fearlessly exposed the sinister purpose back of the bill—the suppression of freedom of thought and conscience, and the re-uniting of church and state, which would end democracy in Chile and bring in once again the tyrannical rule of priestcraft. A judge on the Appellate Court of Santiago likewise sees the sinister purpose back of the bill. All his life he has fought against the encroachments of the Hierarchy, knowing full well its poisonous and disastrous effects upon the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our hopes, our desires and our lives are tied up In Jehovah’s new world of righteousness, which is near at hand. In unison with our brethren world-wide our one desire is to serve The Theocracy; its King, Christ Jesus; and its Founder, Jehovah God. With a new year of service ahead and with a message of comfort, peace, hope and life we are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to continue forward in the blessed work of inviting the nations to praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">One wonders whether the true message of God’s kingdom will ever reach all parts of China. It is such a big country and so many millions of people live there compared with the few witnesses that the prospects look very discouraging. But Jehovah God through his Son commanded that this gospel of the Kingdom should be preached in all the world, and China is part of it; so the witness goes ahead there too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been a number of faithful brethren in Shanghai for years. During the past service year the Society sent two Gilead graduates to Shanghai to help the brethren in organization. The conditions they found there among the people generally are enough to cause anyone’s heart to ache. The population of Shanghai has increased greatly during recent years as the war and the general conditions have driven many people from the land and into the cities. Shanghai now has about five times its comfortable population. This gives the publishers plenty of people to talk to, and they are finding ‘hearing ears’. Jehovah’s witnesses are just getting started in Shanghai, and the Lord’s people throughout the world will watch with keen interest what happens in this land. The Branch servant, who is looking after the work generally, sends in a very interesting report, part of which is published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers in China are probably the fewest in numbers of all the large nations. Their fewness has made them seem like a small island in the midst of this great sea of humanity. Nevertheless they realize that upon them falls the responsibility of finding and feeding the Lord’s “other sheep” in this land. The publishers know that such a great task could not be accomplished without the help of the Lord, and they have looked to him to open up the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The faithful stand of our brethren in Quebec brought great publicity to Jehovah’s witnesses in this city. Headlines in the newspapers announced “Quebec Outlaws a Religious Sect”. This caused considerable unfavorable comment. We had not received any information about the persecution of our brethren in Quebec, and so we were without an answer to refute the charges of “sedition”. However, Jehovah provided us with the answer, for just at that time we received a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> setting forth the full facts. We immediately got busy to inform the public of the truth. Letters were written incorporating much of the material in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and these were taken to the editors of the principal newspapers. Practically all printed the full letter, with the result that a good witness was given regarding the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. The effect of all this was that more people wanted our literature when we went from house to house. Indeed the Devil’s effort to turn the people against Jehovah’s servants had the opposite effect: more were now favorable to us. We feel that we have our brethren in Quebec to thank, for their faithful stand has been a means of spreading the gospel in this distant land. Much publicity was also given when the public press printed substantial extracts from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's </span><span class="font4">magazine article on Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The news that the president, Brother Knorr, was to visit Shanghai brought great rejoicing among all the brethren. For very many years no president or representative of the Society had visited China, and the brethren longed for the joys of an assembly. Also it was realized that the work needed reorganizing, there being many problems in the way of forward movement. When the time arrived the brethren went to the airport to greet the travelers, only to be informed that the plane had developed engine trouble. However, it was expected later in the day. The brethren waited, but still no definite news. The airport authorities were unaware that the flight had been canceled. In the meantime a telegram from Brother Knorr was taking two days to make the short journey from Hong Kong. It eventually arrived. The news that Brother Knorr could not. get a plane to Shanghai in the time available came as a great disappointment to all. We felt that we had been dealt a heavy blow, but the Lord would make good our loss in some way. Efforts were made by the Branch servant to join Brother Knorr at Hong Kong, but It w<sup>T</sup>as found impossible to get a plane on such short notice; all reservations had been booked weeks in advance. However, amid our great disappointment we thought of our brethren in other parts of the earth and we were glad that Brother Knorr bad been able to keep his schedule and serve them, who were just as eagerly looking forward to his visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a long time the brethren have watched the graduations of the classes from Gilead. Would some be assigned here? was always the question in our mind. We had long ago written, requesting Gilead assistance, and this had been promised. Then early in the year came the news that three had been assigned to China and would arrive soon. Two arrived in June; one more is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When witnessing the brethren meet the people In their humble homes and are able to see just how the people live. Nothing has been done to improve the living conditions of the people, the government being preoccupied with fighting the civil war. Except for the Kingdom these people have nowhere to turn for help. The brethren well realize this, and are willing to endure the difficulties, the dirt, evil smells and disease in order to get the message to the people. During the summer months the great heat has to be endured. Meetings are conducted with doors and windows open to get relief. Most brethren make use of the traditional Chinese fan, but still perspiration flows freely. Open doors and windows allow for much noise from the street to be heard, such as the monotonous tune of a Chinese fiddler, who, imagining that everyone loves his music, keeps it up with great gusto; and many other such noises have to be tolerated when meeting together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The zealous work of a brother in the interior of China has caused the religionists to fear for the “safety” of their flocks. One of their members after reading the books took his stand for the truth and joined in actively in the witness work. These so-called Christian religionists resorted to the Devil’s tactics, bringing heavy pressure upon the new publisher, and bribing him into returning to the “church”. This new publisher gave way under the great pressure. The same method was used against the brother, offering him a job in their religious system. The brother turned them down flat, giving them a straight answer from the Word of God. The so-called “Christians” they have produced have come to be known here as “rice Christians”, because they serve God just for the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feel confident of having a full share in the great expansion work and thereby sharing with our brethren everywhere in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. For this we are truly grateful and give thanks unto our God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The few of Jehovah’s witnesses serving the interests of the Kingdom in Colombia are zealously pushing forward with the work. The Society has sent many missionaries to Colombia. A number of them have returned to the United States because of sickness or other causes, but those who remain are diligent in the service and, by the Lord’s grace, will endure to the very end. The people of this country groan under the heavy domination of the Catholic Church, which has always tried to keep the people of South America in ignorance and to rule them by superstition. The people are burdened down with their political disturbances and their religious weights, but, despite this, some progress is made in the preaching of the gospel. Some interesting experiences have been enjoyed by the publishers, and a few of these are related by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preaching is continuing to increase, and with it the attendant blessings and joys of service. During December two brethren were sent to visit the Paz de Rio company back iu the Andes. Its two regular publishers were happy for this provision and the company servant’s brother was also there, having traveled from his home in another state, about three hundred miles distant. He wanted to be baptized and to return to his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font4"> as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. His desire was realized and this office has been pleased to receive his monthly reports. One day was spent in witnessing on the mountainside, after which a service talk was given to thirty-four attentive hearers in the open patio of the mountain home where the Kingdom Hall is located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following day, a Sunday, was devoted to witnessing in the valley where the village of Paz de Rio is situated. Less than ten percent of the population was at home, due to a big religious </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'‘fiesta”</span><span class="font4"> that day in the “plaza”, where a religious procession was in progress. Unexpected publicity for us came when the procession halted and the long-robed priest leading it announced in a loud voice: “I am Informed that some strangers have come to our midst to disrupt our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘fiesta’.</span><span class="font4"> I understand that they are to deliver a Bible lecture. I protest. I prohibit any Catholic from attending this Bible conference that is to be given by irresponsible men.” About an hour later the “irresponsible men”, Brothers Tracy and Brodeur, combined their limited Spanish, each giving half of the lecture “The Destiny of This Earth”. Thirty-five listeners stood and squatted in the open </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">patio</span><span class="font4"> of a good-will person, amid the continual bursting of rockets (peculiar to South American festivals) and the crow of a rooster that one of the attenders had brought along. After several books were placed tile two-hour walk up the mountain brought the brethren together for a final meeting, a Spanish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">study by candlelight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">January found a “lost sheep’’ appearing at the Bogota missionary home. Over a year previously this man had contact with the Brooklyn office. He was overjoyed at the prospect of being able to work in conjunction with a Branch office in his own country, and spent two days in the service with us. Since that time we were able to visit him, and now he reports his activity regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the missionaries at the hot, coastal seaport of Barranquilla established a company and now have about five regular publishers. One of the brothers there placed literature with a family and on subsequent back-calls placed approximately fifty books and Bibles with them and their friends. The home servant writes of his experience contacting a person of good-will through a subscriber back-call. After the obtaining of two subscriptions and placing four books and the starting of a book study, this man was desirous of letting his friends know about Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of his friends were professors, and hence the pioneer soon found himself giving a ten-minute discourse (thanks to his ministry training) to an assembled audience of seventy-five teachers and pupils on the subject “Who Are Jehovah’s witnesses?” This was followed by the obtaining of two subscriptions and placing ten books and an urgent request to return after school vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By God’s grace and under the direction of the permanent Governor of all nations may many more voices be heard In Colombia giving praise to Jehovah’s name and kingdom during 1948.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers of the Kingdom have taken the yeartext for 1947 very seriously and have moved ahead, aiding the people in Costa Rica. They have shown their love for God by praising his name and going forward continuously in the field, preaching from house to house, working on the street corners with the magazines, making back-calls, and conducting book studies with those of good-will. As a result the little group of publishers in Costa Rica has increased by 131, and during the year an all-time new high in publishers was reached of 576, to compare with 377, the peak last year. Yes, the publishers in Costa Rica are saying, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant in Costa Rica has sent in a very interesting report. Not all of it, by any means, can be reproduced here, but portions of it are, which will give the reader an idea of the zeal and determination on the part of the brethren to push on in this, their best year of service thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preaching campaign was not confined to the urban territories nor to the heavily populated territories here on the Central Plateau surrounding San Jose, but faithful pioneers and company publishers have gone into regions where the towns are small and scattered and land travel limited to the slow, lumbering oxcart. Three of our San Jose pioneers went into Guanacaste when it was possible to witness effectively; however, the rains came and they had to return, because they could no longer get to their territories. They found many sheep-like persons and are anxious to go back as soon as it is dry enough, which is usually around the middle of December. The dry season will last then until June. To get to this territory our pioneers go as far as Puntarenas by train ; from there it is an overnight trip by launch up the Gulf of Nicoya; and from there a 15- to 20-hour trip by oxcart. Quite a trip for sisters!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A small group in another part of Guanacaste province, at Tilaran, that had gotten hold of the truth from the brethren at Puntarenas wrote in for company service in June and were organized and reported as a company In July with two publishers. Then in August two new pioneers from Puntarenas went there to begin the full-time service; with their aid a total of seven reported time in the field for that month. This section of the province is mountainous and getting around is not so much of a problem as it is in the more level sections during the rainy season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alajuela, one of the Central Plateau cities, has always shown much good-will and a number of them had home Bible studies in their homes when publishers from San Jose could get there. Gradually some of these developed into publishers, and by January 1 there were seven reporting. On the first Sunday in January the circuit servant and the Branch servant made a special trip over with the idea of forming this group into a company. This was accomplished, and since then they have reported a peak of 13 publishers. A group of three special pioneers was sent there to help them on April 1. These three sisters have been a great aid to this new company both in getting new ones into the field and in the company organization itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year saw the forming of five companies in addition to the twelve we had at the beginning of the year. There are more almost ready to be formed, and with the continued efforts of the brethren this will be accomplished. These isolated groups see the advantages of having a company going ; they realize that by having their own organization the Society’s representative calls there every six months to help them build up and spends a week with them in the field and in counseling them on their weak points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With seventeen companies in the country these can be served in that many weeks each six months. The rest of the time Brother Blackburn dedicates to fuil-time missionary service. The companies have all built up since the inauguration of this service. Lack of transportation to many places makes his two circuits difficult, but whether it is by rail, by air, on horseback, on foot or by canoe he gets to his assignment on time and gets into the field to personally instruct as many as he possibly can at each visit. In San Carlos, for example, there are no facilities, and after getting to the company’s headquarters he has to travel each day to get to the publishers, as they all live scattered from each other. Then, instead of one big public meeting on Sunday, the neighbors are invited in and a meeting is held at each stop. Even the native brethren marvel at his stamina in the tropic sun and rain and against the ever-present Insects in this yet untamed wilderness where tiger and bear inhabit the woods along with the wild boar, the deer and lesser animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last two weeks of August the Branch servant and his wife went to Golfito, on the Pacific coast, to witness to the 8,000 or so people there that have to see to the getting out of the bananas from the well-cared-for farms of the United Fruit Company that stretch up the fertile coastal plains for about 75 kilometers. No previous arrangements had been made for our stay, but through the kindness of the management we were permitted to stay In one of the company’s guest houses and to eat at the club. When the time came to settle up we were informed that we had been guests of the company and no pay was accepted for either food or lodging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early Tuesday morning we were calling on the people with the literature, and at the end of the day three of us had placed 83 bound books. In the course of the day we found a family that had had studies in their home here </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">San Jose; so arrangements were made for a study in their one room in the barracks provided for the laborers. Nine were present and arrangements were made to have another study on Friday night, with a study in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> on </span><span class="font4">Sunday. This study group was left in the hands of another person of good-will we met until such a time when the Society saw fit to send one of its representatives there for a longer stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To get to our territory from the zone we had to pass the Catholic church and the parsonage. No doubt the two Franciscan priests the Fruit Company brought in from the States soon became tired of seeing us pass in the morning with three bags loaded with books and then to see us return about 11: 30 witli them empty, only to repeat the procedure in the afternoon. For we hadn’t been there long before we heard that the priests had warned the people with threats of punishment if they took the books. This gave us a better opportunity to witness and to tell the people why they had been warned, with the result that many really took interest to see what it was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also worked the zone. Here is where the Americans and white-collar Costa Ricans live. The houses here are much different from the barracks, where the ‘peones’ live. All are well kept, yet not all are the same size; the size of a house a man gets does not depend on the size of his family but upon his category with the company. Most of the people in the zone treated us kindly and a good amount of literature in both English and Spanish was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had met the man of the house next door, and this particular afternoon we decided to call there and witness to his wife. On the way over the Branch servant mentioned to Sister Siebenlist that it was strange that in all this lot of Americans we had not found one that in some way was connected with the witnesses. After a few minutes with Mrs. Abbott we learned that her father in New Orleans was attending the meetings when he could and that her niece and husband were dedicating all of their time to the witness work. She accepted the offer along with a No. 10 Bible and asked us to return. While there a visitor came in and another Bible was placed with her. Another lady who had been in Honduras with the fruit company had obtained </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom la at Hand”</span><span class="font4"> from a pioneer there and she eagerly accepted four books and placed a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Monday, September 1, came all too soon, yet it was time to get back to the office and take care of the Society’s business there. The friends we had met came to the airfield to see us off and to remind us not to forget them. Although the weather had been extremely hot, and because the town stretches for about two miles on a narrow strip between mountains and sea, the extra walking had us quite tired bodily, but we were refreshed knowing that we had found some of the Lord’s “other sheep” and that they were anxious to keep in contact with the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When all results were totaled we found that we had left behind us more than 400 bound books, many booklets and magazines, along with obtaining four subscriptions. Indeed two weeks well spent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a whole the past service year has brought great rejoicing to the brethren in Costa Rica. Almost all are beginning to see the organization in its true light and are appreciating what the work is. The service is a joy to them and they watch all advancements with keen interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through Theocratic ministry many have become good speakers and are able to help a lot in that direction. The more mature brethren are being given more of the responsibility to shoulder, and in another year or so the work here should take on a well-rounded-out aspect. It has been a joy to work here and see the work grow from month to month, and now it has been from year to year. We claim no credit for ourselves, but give Jehovah the praise and honor for having blessed the efforts of his faithful servants here in this land. We continue to look to him for further increases and blessings and trust in his loving care and protection as we do our share as commanded, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Again a wonderful witness was given in this land. The publishers in Cuba have been very zealous for the past five years, and every year has seen a very marked increase, including the service year 1947, when a new peak of 3,682 publishers was reached. The brethren in the “Pearl of the Antilles” have zealously moved forward in the ever-expanding work of preaching the Kingdom truths throughout Cuba. They have eagerly taken hold of all the provisions the Lord has made for the preaching of the gospel. This year’s report shows that they have enjoyed to the full the circuit assemblies and the circuit arrangements. An outstanding thing in the Cuban report is that in 10 out of the 12 months of the service year the publishers reached new peaks! The Branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences that show what has been accomplished in isolated territories by just one or more pioneers. The general report that follows will be an encouragement to all the readers of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit activity meetings were the outstanding features of the assemblies. At these meetings, the importance of giving practical aid to the irregular and inactive as well as to the new ones was stressed. In addition to much counsel and instructions showing the publishers how it could be done, many examples were given showing how the Lord had richly blessed the efforts of the brethren in this country in giving practical aid to the new and weaker ones. One faithful and hard-working pioneer related how, about five years ago, when lie started to work in a territory that was completely virgin, there wasn’t a single publisher in it, and that today, five years later, there were nine companies with 291 company publishers and 8 pioneers in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another pioneer told how three years ago he started to work in a territory that had likewise never before been worked, and now, three years later, there were three companies with 232 publishers and 16 pioneers in this territory. (This pioneer has organized still another company since the circuit assembly.) Two other pioneers related how, seven months after starting to work in a completely new territory, they had organized a new company with 90 associated in it. These experiences thrilled all in attendance. In relating these experiences these brethren showed the importance of rendering practical aid to the new and weaker ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public talk “Blessed Are the Peacemakers” was enthusiastically received, and proved to be of great benefit to the many people of good-will, showing them who are the true “peacemakers”. At these assemblies the brethren rejoiced to hear of Brother Knorr’s round-the-world trip in visiting many of the Branches, and attending the conventions arranged for in many of these countries. They also rejoiced to hear of the great increase in number of publishers in Cuba, an increase from about 150 publishers in early 1940 to well over 3,000 in 1947. After the assemblies the publishers returned to their homes spiritually refreshed to continue on in the great expansion work. They are all anxiously looking forward to the coming circuit assemblies. These gatherings are truly the provision of the Lord, in this the Lord’s due time for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in the past years, the brethren have enthusiastically supported and pushed the company book-study work. This has also aided greatly in the increase in publishers. Practically all of the 22 new companies organized during the year were formerly company book-study groups. During the past two years, six company book studies in the territory of one company have been organized into six new companies. Due of the servants to the brethren reports that during his first visit to one of the companies a group of zealous plo-neers working with the company were just at that time starting to work in a new part of the company’s territory. A short while later these pioneers organized a book-study group there. On the servant’s second visit, six months later, lie found that there were 45 new publishers in that part of the company’s territory, witli a good number of them putting in over 60 hours a month in the field service, and three of them ready to start out in the pioneer service. He said the knowledge of the truth that these brethren had, for such a short space of time, was amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The companies, realizing full well the importance that the public meeting campaign plays in the Kingdom expansion work, have pushed this feature of the work, and the results show the Lord’s rich blessings upon their efforts. Hundreds of those who first became acquainted with the Lord’s organization through the public meeting work are now publishers. The number of meetings held during the year show an increase of more than fifty percent over last year. One of the companies had as many as six different series going on at the same time in its territory. Many of the companies are holding series of public talks at night during the week in the homes where the company book studies are held. In doing this they are obtaining excellent results. This has greatly aided in building up the good-will interest in the territory around the study, as well as increased the service activities of the groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New public talks were started in December. These gave added impetus to the campaign. Handbills with designs similar to the ones used in the States, and printed on our newly acquired job press, also gave an added stimulus to this feature of the work. Over 2,500,000 handbills were printed during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other outstanding events of the year were the special December campaign with the new booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> in Spanish, and the special Memorial activity in April. The results obtained in these two campaigns were beyond expectation. December witnessed the greatest number of booklets ever placed in any one month, as well as a new peak in publishers. The Memorial week-end In April saw 4,646 attending the Memorial, and 4,046 at the Sunday afternoon public talks. As a result of the special Memorial week-end activity, a new peak in publishers was likewise reached in April. In preparation for these two campaigns the Society stressed the importance of starting new ones out in the service. It is interesting to note that many of those who were first given the opportunity of participating in the service in these months are now very active publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bringing great joy to our hearts was the thrilling information received from the Los Angeles convention, telling of the great expansion work going on in all parts of the world, thus showing that it is now Jehovah’s due time for the expansion of his true worship into all nations. Fully realizing this, the brethren in this land are united with their brethren world-wide in the ever-expanding Kingdom work in all nations, as Zion ‘breaks forth on the right hand and on the left’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country, which is situated in the heart of Europe, has felt the pains of war, but has come through it in pretty good condition. Czechoslovakia is getting back on her feet rapidly. There are about 12,000,000 people who live in this nation that fell under the power of the Hitler government in the spring of 1939. Seventy percent are Czech-speaking people, and about 30 percent Slovenian. Jehovah’s witnesses in this country consider it a great privilege to represent the King and the Kingdom along with their brethren in all parts of the world. Jehovah has blessed his work in this country. Many people of good-will have been made glad with his people and have joined with them in the service. Despite the opposition and persecution that befalls Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia, the work goes grandly on. The outstanding events of the year are reported by the Branch servant, and this report shows the joy and gladness on the part of the brethren in Czechoslovakia. You will read it with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the outset the year promised to be most prosperous and encouraging. From the end of World War II, when the door to the free worship of Jehovah opened wide before us, we had been constantly searching for suitable office accommodation from which central location the witness work could be taken care of for the whole country. The Lord heard our entreaties, and right at the beginning of this service year we were able to negotiate for the purchase of a house. The funds with which to buy this house were not on hand in full, but it was encouraging to see with what readiness the brethren throughout the country placed their money at the disposal of the Society as loans, and many as gifts, so that already on November 2, 1946, we were able to move into our new Bethel home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This house is very suitable as a Branch office of the Society, and, additionally, the Bethel family have quiet working and sleeping quarters, which they appreciate very much. They all know that it is a special favor for them to work in this place and to serve their fellow publishers throughout the country. At the time that this report is being written nine brethren are engaged in the office and shipping department of this Branch. Much more effective work can be done in these new quarters than in former months when we were scattered all over Prague working and living in the homes of various brethren. The purchase of this house means a powerful step forward in the expansion work. The brethren of the Berne Branch office were very helpful in supplying us with a consignment of necessary household goods for the furnishing of our home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A still further joyful event immediately at the beginning of the service year was our first postwar general convention, which was held in Brno on September 27 to 29. This was all the more encouraging as it was the first general assembly of all the brethren in our country again after a period of nine years. Participating were 1,400. We received the reports of the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cleveland as published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> in good time, so that in the main our convention could be arranged according to the Cleveland program. The public lecture “The Prince of Peace” was attentively listened to by almost 1,700 persons. There were 131 new publishers that symbolized their consecration by water immersion. Without doubt this convention was a great stimulus to further service, as evidenced by the field service reports that followed; but this was eclipsed by far by the second general convention held in this service year, from June 3 to 5, 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For long months we had looked forward to this time and to the anticipated visit of the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brother Knorr, and his secretary, Brother Henschel. Arrangements were made for a convention to be held to coincide with Brother Knorr’s visit, and again the city of Brno was chosen for this event. Great was our joy when, on June 3, not only could we welcome Brothers Knorr and Henschel at the airport in Prague, but also Brother Covington and a brother from the Berne office. Many matters pertaining to the service work in Czechoslovakia were discussed and much valuable counsel received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inexpressible joy throbbed in the hearts of the 1,700 visitors to this second general assembly held on June 4 and 5 as they listened to the encouraging words of Brother Knorr and his companions. The brethren and friends of the truth were most enthusiastic, and this joyful assembly will remain long in their memories. The crowning event to this grand convention was a public lecture advertised for the last evening, when Brother Knorr addressed an attentive audience of 2,300 on the subject “The Joy of All the People”. During the convention we had the biggest immersion service ever performed in our country, when 173 persons of good-will publicly testified to their determination to serve Jehovah God and to worship him alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had difficulties of all kinds to overcome in procuring the necessary paper for the printing of booklets. Despite this we were able to have different booklets printed in the Czech and Slovakian languages to a grand total of 510,000 copies. Foremost was the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font4"> of which we were able to publish 120,000 in Czech and 100,000 in Slovakian. In addition 250,000 copies of the leaflet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> and a large quantity of handbills and various forms were printed. An effective help in the providing of literature were the two large consignments sent from Brooklyn which arrived during the year. This co-operation of our brethren In America Is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The course in Theocratic ministry has been introduced in all companies and the brethren are making good use of this provision through Jehovah’s organization in order to become more effective publishers, “perfectly equipped for every good work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Czech-speaking parts of the country the ministers of the gospel seldom come up against opposition; so, on the whole, they can peacefully continue in their work. Here and there the biased press, mostly of religious tendency, has sought to put Jehovah’s witnesses in a false light by slander ; but the people do not pay particular attention to these defamations. On the other band, the clergy in the Catholic regions of Slovakia behave with the utmost intolerance and brutality. With their agitation they endeavor to suppress the preaching of the Kingdom message. There are often cases were the mob, spurred on by the priests, have fallen upon and ill-treated our brethren to such an extent that many have had to seek medical aid. For these religious “defenders” of Christendom no weapon is foul enough to use against the witnesses of the Most High. They frequently threaten to kill the ministers of the gospel for the one reason only that they do good in publishing the truth. Such modern-day persecution of Christians is continually on the increase, making it necessary in the interests of the free worship of God to institute three lawsuits against these workers of violence. One was ruled in favor of the brethren and two are still pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These difficulties are unable to check the forward march of the work of proclamation, however. The goodness of Jehovah and his approval and blessing far outweigh all the suffering that the adversaries of God’s people can bring upon them. And the Lord has richly blessed us in the past year. Our hearts are filled with deep joy and we are happy to stand for the righteous cause of Jehovah and his “Prince of Peace” with all our brethren earth-wide. Truly, nothing can be compared to the joy of proclaiming loud the lifegiving call: “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It certainly must be a pleasure for a Branch servant to settle down in his office and make out a year’s report, and especially is this true for Brother Dey in Denmark. The last report he made for this country was in 1940, when he hastily wrote out his report for the year in pencil after the Nazis had taken over. Shortly thereafter he was interned and kept in confinement until the war was over. The reason for his being put away in a concentration camp was because of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font5"> It got on the nerves of the Nazis; they couldn’t face the facts. While in the camp, Brother Dey witnessed to all the guards and those in the kitchen as well as to the inmates. After his release from the concentration camp he had the opportunity of coming to America, where he visited Gilead and attended the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. Before he returned to again take up the work in Denmark, he was given special instruction at the Bethel office in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been quite an increase in the work in Denmark since 1940, when Brother Dey was taken away. Then there were 1,244 publishers in the field, while now there are 2,724 on the average. So the Branch servant, along with all the publishers in Denmark, has real cause for rejoicing. The report by the Branch servant gives one the feeling shared by all of the Danish brethren toward their fellow workers throughout the world. Here again we see that Jehovah’s witnesses are one nation, one people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two happenings have hindered the work considerably this year: (1) a very severe winter with temperature far below zero, day and night for weeks on end, and (2) a four months’ typographers’ strike in Copenhagen, which prevented our getting our magazines printed and also the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font4"> as well as the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”.</span><span class="font4"> Denmark is a very windy land, and this intensified the wintry cold. One pioneer was blown off her bicycle on an icy road and has been on the sick list ever since, while other pioneers have had to retire for reasons of health. Indeed, our pioneer ranks fell to 23 one month, but now, by reason of arrangements made by the president at his visit in June, they have increased again to 53, and we hope soon to have more joining up, as application forms are asked for from time to time. This is very encouraging and will without doubt give a great fillip to the work, as many of the small companies are weak and have asked that pioneers be sent to help them to get better organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have now a 13,000 edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and 45,000 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> for although 7,700 and 20,650, respectively, are sent by post to subscribers, yet there are many single copies placed, some regularly and some irregularly. The clear presentation of the truth in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is much appreciated, and also the stress laid upon the privilege that is ours to publish the good news of the Kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has, of course, always been the same in all languages, but now </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> will also be the same as to the bulk of its contents. So, all over the earth Jehovah’s witnesses are presenting the same message, in the same way, and at the same time. Without doubt, the ever-increasing spread of these magazines will help many people of good-will to take their stand for the truth before the great and terrible day of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The annual convention from June 6 to 8, at which our president and his secretary were present, was the biggest ever held in Denmark. It commenced with 3,123 and ended with 3,325, while at the public meeting 4,034 were present. It was good to have our American brethren with us and to hear their reports on the work in the various countries they had visited in their world tour. The unity obtaining among the Lord’s people all over the earth was emphasized, and it was gladdening to hear of the Lord’s blesslfig on the work in every land. The public lecture, with its clear proclamation of the fundamental truths, was much enjoyed, and many newly interested ones with whom book studies had been held were present, especially from Copenhagen. One of these wrote saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I was in K.B.Hallen on Sunday afternoon and was much enthused by the fine way in which the convention was arranged and in particular, of course, by Mr. N. H. Knorr’s lecture. If in course of time it comes out as a booklet I should very much like to get a copy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One pioneer in a town 100 miles away had brought no less than 16 newly interested friends to the convention, and seven of them were out in the work for the first time. Yes, it was a happy and blessed time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In harmony with directions from head office, Denmark is now divided into eight circuits, and in that connection we are very glad to have two of our brethren who journeyed to Gilead last year back with us once more after their course of six months’ intensive training at the school there. Both of them are employed as servants to the brethren, and, additionally, the one for the Copenhagen circuit is also district servant for the other seven circuits. It is very good to have brethren trained in all the latest head-office methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is one point we must not omit to mention, viz., street witnessing with the magazines. This was recommended by the president at the convention and introduced at the circuit assemblies with very good results. The police have shown themselves well disposed so long as we follow their traffic regulations. One difficulty is that cloth to make satchels is very scarce in Denmark. Here an American brother on holiday unselfishly used quite a deal of time In securing material from various concerns. Another brother cut up and printed the bags and a sister is now sewing them, so before the month is out we hope to supply a small army of street workers witli satchels as they have them In the States and this will be a further aid In placing the magazines and advertising the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Denmark is a food-producing country and so far as food is concerned its inhabitants are well placed. However, it is far otherwise in the matter of clothing. Food packets they have been able to send to other lands, but clothing is very scarce in Denmark. However, just as in the early church Paul took the collections from Macedonia to help the brethren in Jerusalem, so in our day our brethren in America and Canada have helped us here in Denmark, as well as in other lands, with plentiful supplies of clothing, very difficult to obtain in Denmark and then, too, very expensive. When last year’s report was made ten tons had been received and office brethren and pioneers helped. Later on brethren al) over Denmark received help. All together, 2,520 brethren were benefited in this way, and they were very grateful to their American brethren. The following letter is a sample of many received: “When next you write to America will you kindly send our heartiest greetings and thanks for the grand gift they have sent us?” Another letter was phrased thus: “The company assembled at a work meeting desire to convey their deep appreciation and thanks not only for the gifts but also for the spirit of which they are the expression. The clothes are a real help in a difficult time and have given pleasure in many homes. We will show our appreciation of the generous gift by standing together with our American brethren in the same spirit and power to drive the battle to the gate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year we have received and distributed seven tons of clothing from our brethren In Canada as arranged by head office, and all feel deeply grateful for this further expression of love from our brethren across the water. The following letter from the company servant in one of the circuits is typical of many more. “Including children we have helped 315 friends. I am convinced that this gift has been of great help to the friends and has called forth many expressions of joy and thankfulness. In behalf of all these friends I therefore beg of you to let our heartfelt thanks be sent over to head office.” The Canadian shipment benefited 1,691 brethren, and all the brethren In Denmark are deeply grateful for these gifts of clothing sent by their brethren in the States and Canada and pray Jehovah’s blessing upon them for their loving-kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And so with warm love in our Lord the Bethel family send their greetings to you and all the Bethel family In Brooklyn. Daily do we remember you and all your colaborers there and at Gilead to the end that you may all be given grace, wisdom and strength to carry out the glorious work entrusted to your care.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Two and a half years ago the Society sent to the Dominican Republic the first of Jehovah’s witnesses to preach in that land. These were some graduates from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. They took up their assignment in the capital city. Now there is a company of Jehovah’s witnesses with 43 publishers in Ciudad Trujillo. There has been a slow but steady increase in the number of publishers in this land. Last year there were 16, and now there are 59 regular publishers, with a peak in June of 84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last decade the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been losing its grip on the people. They see the selfishness of that religious system and have very little respect for it. However, not having learned of the Bible or having been taught its contents, they just travel along in the world, getting out of it what they can. The truth is the only thing that will bring the people comfort and hope. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Dominican Republic are trying to aid the people to follow the truth so that they may gain life in the new world. The Branch servant’s report sets out some interesting facts and the conditions as they exist in the Dominican Republic, showing how the people are being comforted and taking their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The past year has been one with many blessings and one in which we have had much ireedom to spread the truth. No serious opposition has arisen, aside from warnings against our work being published in Catholic papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the year a new missionary home was opened in San Pedro de Macoris, making a total of three homes in the country. Though only two missionaries are there, yet they had success from the very beginning, as the following experience of one of them, enjoyed while making the bus trip to Macoris from Ciudad Trujillo, will show:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While making the trip from Ciudad Trujillo to our assignment we were riding on a bus which carried, in addition to passengers, such items as groceries, furniture, livestock and poultry. As the bus was very crowded, I thought I would have to stand, but it happened that I was offered a small portion of a seat which was shared by another lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Noting that I was an American, she spoke to me in English, inquiring as to why we were going to Macoris. This opportunity to witness to her was used, though none too effectively amidst the crowing of the roosters and the squirming of a hairless dog right under my feet. I was able, however, to take her name and address, and, after getting settled in our assignment, I made a back-call at her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That was the start of a book study which has been in progress now ten months. Now she, this inquiring ‘other sheep’ who was met by chance on a crowded bus, is also a Kingdom publisher and is ready to use every opportunity to witness, be it from house to house, on back-calls or on book studies, or even on a crowded bus!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the world-wide </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower-Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign was announced to begin January 1, it was feared that we could not participate in it, because in the previous subscription campaign, though we took many subscriptions, uc had great difficulty in getting the magazines delivered, due to a faulty postal system. At the suggestion of the Society, however, we did have a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign in which we took 272 new subscriptions. Instead of relying on the old-world postal system to deliver the magazines, the publishers supplied their own Theocratic delivery service. Allowing the subscriber’s copies to come direct to the Branch office, the publishers who took the subscriptions then dutifully delivered the magazines personally. This has been to our advantage, resulting in many more personal contacts with the readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were greatly encouraged by having three Dominican brethren enroll in the pioneer ranks during the past year. These brethren have all learned the truth during the last two years. The manner in which the newest pioneer came in contact with the truth is peculiar in that it is the “model” experience of the first contact, the back-call, the book study, then a publisher, and finally a pioneer, in so many easy steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people here have been kept in darkness for hundreds of years by the Catholic Church, and many are fully aware of it. Thus they are turning from religion and are grasping for the truth. As they have failed to find it in religion, so have they failed to find it in the philosophies of men. The way in which one publisher here learned the truth is related in the following experience turned in by the publisher holding a study with him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ ... he would occasionally use the columns of his newspaper in which to make remarks such as this: ‘Today the parade in honor of the Virgin of Altagracia passed these offices. In her honor, young boys exploded firecrackers about her worshiped image being carried by her reverential devotees. And though at one moment a firecracker blew off the hand of an unfortunate youngster, who by exploding the same was seeking to do her honor, her cold stare continued unbendingly forward as she ignored his pain.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When the census takers asked this editor what his religion was, he told them that he was an atheist, for he did not believe in religion. Then, In April of 1947 the Spanish edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest</span><span class="font4"> carried the report about the Glad Nation’s Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. Though professing to be an ‘atheist’, this man, who had sold his paper several years before, was so captivated by this article that he hunted up the sign reading ‘Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's witnesses’, and started attending the meetings. He has obtained all the literature in Spanish. After one month of attending meetings, he enrolled in the Theocratic School. Discovering from Theocratic definitions that his daughter bore the name of an ancient opposer of God, he went to court to have her name changed to one not out of harmony with the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now an able Kingdom publisher, he has seven book studies of his own in his home town about fifteen miles distant from the capital, where the local Catholic priests have dubbed him ‘the preacher’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On reviewing the past year’s activities and seeing the forward progress of the witness work, we remain convinced of the fact that this is Jehovah’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes. Jehovah has made conditions very favorable under which we work, and obviously it is his will that we take advantage of these favorable conditions and do as much work as we can. For that reason, none of us wants to slack the hand or let the momentum gained slow down and stop. We wish to w<sup>r</sup>ork while there is opportunity here, for sometime conditions may not be so good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before closing, I wish to express on behalf of the Gilead brethren here not only our gratitude to Jehovah for using us in his service, but also our gratitude for the arrangement made for our comfort and health in the missionary home, knowing that we enjoy such blessings not by right, but by the grace of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The great majority of the population in Egypt are Moslems or Mohammedans. Only a few million are Copts, belonging to the Eastern Orthodox religion. Then there are thousands of other persons: Greeks, Italians, Syrians, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Armenians and other minorities which go to make up the population of Egypt. With this mixed population and the mixture of languages, one finds it quite difficult to express himself going from house to house; but Jehovah’s witnesses in that land are puttting forth an earnest effort to find the “other sheep”. The general condition of the Egyptian people is that of misery and poverty. Many do not have homes in which to sleep; so they must make someone’s doorstoop their bed for the night or even use the streets for their bedrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large number of the people have a real problem on their hands to feed their two or three wives and their children on their small incomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the many forms of religion and the difficulties of the people, the message of the gospel goes on, and some are hearing. There are now 68 publishers in Egypt who are becoming better organized due to the help of the newly established Branch. The Branch servant makes the following report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is really a great joy and a big help to Jehovah’s witnesses in Egypt to have our own Branch. We recognize that this was a provision of the Lord as part of the great expansion work that is now taking place in all the earth. On July 1 the Branch in Egypt began to operate. Our first big problem was to locate offices and a home to house the Branch servant and those associated with him. Housing conditions are bad in Cairo, but finally a suitable place was obtained. Soon thereafter two graduates of Gilead arrived in Egypt to assist In the organization of the work, and this made glad our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first thing to do was to send one of these brethren to visit the various companies. So along with a translator he went from place to place, trying to organize new companies and stabilizing those that had been formed in earlier years. Visits were made to persons in prisons for German troops, who had heard of the truth and requested someone to call upon them. A group of 15 interested prisoners are having regular studies and are beginning to realize that there is only one hope for the world, and that is God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event of the year was the visit of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel, and the one week that they stayed in Egypt is, for us, one of unforgettable days. Public talks were arranged for in Cairo and Alexandria, and the total attendance was 415 at these two meetings. Much counsel and instruction was given to the brethren, which was greatly appreciated. Egypt needed this visit, and our desire for more help was again answered in the arrival of the two Gilead graduates who came from Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many problems to overcome here, particularly the battle against religious superstitions and the great ignorance of the Egyptian people. The majority of the people are unable to read or write, so the work becomes twofold : not only giving Instruction in the way to the Kingdom, but also helping the people to read and write, so that they will be better qualified to do their own studying. The little group of faithful servants of the Lord are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to expand the Kingdom message here in the vast valley of the Nile river. We rejoice greatly because we have a part with all of our brethren throughout the earth in this great educational work which is expanding under the leadership of the “Commander to the People”, Christ Jesus. We in Egypt appreciate our responsibility and are inviting the people with the cry, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers for the Kingdom in El Salvador are looking for men who are seeking Jehovah, whether they be bond or free, rich or poor; for they know that God made all men alike. While there is a marked distinction between the two classes in Latin countries, still Jehovah’s witnesses serve both with the message of the Kingdom. Excellent progress has been made during the past year. In 1946 there was an average of 22 publishers, while during the 1947 service year 80 regularly joined in the proclamation of the Kingdom, and a new all-time peak of 136 ministers of the gospel was reached for El Salvador. This can be attributed to the large number of back-calls and book studies that are being conducted regularly. The report of the newly appointed Branch servant in El Salvador is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Awake! Awake! El Salvador, stand up! You have been entered in the expansion contest. But how? And by whose permission? Is it religiously, or politically, or militaristically that you are expanding? No, that is not the answer. You are expanding in truth, in proper education, and in God’s Word, the Bible, much to the shock of the religious leaders; but, lo, by the permission of him who stretched out the heavens and put his name over a boundless universe, Jehovah of hosts is the One, the God of all expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His true name, along with the glad tidings of his Theocratic Government, was brought here to this small nation tucked away among the small republics of Central America but a few years ago, by Gilead graduates with an eye for an “all nations” expansion of true worship. Their desires have been met, especially during the past year, by hundreds of men of good-will, who display their heartfelt thanks that Jehovah’s witnesses are in their midst with real spiritual food instead of the husks that religion offers for a big price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neither are we now alone in the service of praise in making house-to-house calls, back-calls and book studies, but at this date we have more than 125 ministers of the gospel, which have not been sent here by an outside source but which Jehovah has raised up, from their own native ranks, into his glorious treasure of service. As up to the present day two of the above ministers were not satisfied with just being company publishers, they went pioneering. Are they successful? The reports are very encouraging and gratifying to compare, as one pioneer in his first month of service reached a peak of 205 field-service hours with 77 book placements along with five book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the ranks of these new publishers and active Interest for the King we find doctors, bankers, lawyers, general business people and many poor. There is a sharp division here between the money class and the poor as far as the world goes, thus creating a barrier between the two classes. However, we have both classes at our public lectures, weekly meetings and even into field service, one sitting alongside the other, apparently enjoying each other’s company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among our dearest associates and touching to any kind heart are our blind men that see. It is true they do not see the light of day, but the light of truth is not barred out, no, not one ray is obscured to them. We have not only one or two of such blind, but four. Are they publishers? Yes, in the highest order; not one ray is absorbed and stored away for a selfish purpose, but the rays strike only to again be reflected in a most illuminating manner. They gain their meager living selling daily papers and government lottery tickets, but they live not by bread alone; so it is seen that among the bunch of daily papers clung tightly under their arm there is the most important magazine of the day, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two companies in the republic, one here at San Salvador, the capital, and the other at Santa Ana, which is situated high on the mountains in the heart of the coffee belt, at the western end of our small republic. The latter is the younger of the two companies, but very thrifty and growing rapidly. The last circuit assembly was held there with a climax crowd attendance of 475 persons. You can imagine our joy upon seeing that gathering of bright goodwill faces, beaming witli smiles, as they intently listened to the public address, in Spanish, “Blessed Are the Peacemakers.” The company, as a result, has strengthened itself manyfold since that circuit assembly; surely a noble provision of Jehovah for his “other.sheep”. Before the assembly the good-will people appeared skeptical of Jehovah’s witnesses, thinking, “Well, as soon as they get all their books sold they’ll just leave and we’ll be left behind.” Now they see it is a permanent thing and that Jehovah’s witnesses are here for good. They have become confident and now exercise faith in Jehovah and his Theocratic organization, seeing eye to eye with us though we were from another nation, realizing that signifies nothing as we have become one under the Kingdom. There is no race barrier, as our love for one another is deep and sincere; they know that our battle Is their battle, that our trouble is their trouble, and that what the Lord gives he equally shares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though another year has ended in the King’s treasure house, we are much richer and stronger, being made better equipped for the fight ahead, and our intentions are to push the battle deep in the year and years to come until he who directs all shall say, “It is done.” “Praise Jehovah, all ye nations,” and awake from the dust of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country has its problems as a nation. As the burdens are heavy upon the nation, so these burdens fall upon the people. Due to the great sufferings and hardships through many years of war, the Finnish people have had time to think and wonder what it is all about. Many are seeking something better, something with a real hope, something that will bring life and peace and happiness instead of turmoil and war. Jehovah’s witnesses have brought the answer to thousands in Finland, and many have believed. In 1946 there were 1,803 publishers, but today there is an average of 2,281, and a new all-time peak was reached of 2,696 servants of the Lord. Yes, in Finland the people have been giving a 'hearing ear’, and they appreciate the truth. The report of the servant to the brethren gives expression to their appreciation and shows that the publishers are really zealous in trying to help the people of good-will. Here we have another nation where the praises of God are a testimony before the people, and many are giving an ear to this new song, a song of praise. The Branch servant’s report, which is very interesting, follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit arrangement has given a very fine push to the work. The circuit work started January 1 with 17 circuits. Now we have 20, as the companies have increased by 84. The first assemblies were started in April, and in September they will begin the second time around. On the first time around, 18 circuits were served, from which 239 companies and 2,204 publishers were represented. That means about 86 percent of the peak of the publishers in these circuits. Attending the public lectures were 5,985, and during the assemblies 136 symbolized their consecration. All the reports bear witness of great joy among the friends, and we are all looking with very keen interest upon the second time around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole activity has been helping more and more newly interested to take their stand on the side of the Lord, consecrating themselves to do his will and symbolizing it by water immersion. The big increase is easily seen, when this year is compared with the previous year. The year before, 192 were baptized, and now 666. The number of publishers has increased from 2,073 to 2,696, which means about 30 percent. Yet, there is still much interest in the country, and we see clearly a very great work before us, and by the Lord’s grace we are trying to do our best, in order to help all people of good-will to know of the Kingdom and its blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the Lutheran religion is the state belief in our country, it is taught in all the schools. Of the whole population, 96 percent are enrolled as Lutherans, although we have the law of religious freedom which we got in 1923. The reason may be that the religionists practice such a pressure that many have not courage to go out of the church, especially as many have experienced that it is easier to get suitable secular work if they belong to the state church, which has the best reputation in the eyes of the vast majority of the people. Anyhow, the law guarantees, under certain conditions, a possibility for the children to be taught during the lesson of religion something else, which the board of the school will accept. In one of our biggest cities the brethren succeeded in arranging time for children to be taught in the truth instead of religion. A special classroom was provided for them, and as textbook </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font4"> was used. A consecrated sister, a former schoolteacher, was accepted by the board to do the teaching. From her interesting report I might cite the following: “From the 29 pupils, 14 symbolized their consecration, and 22 took part in all the various forms of the witnessing work. The youngest of the children was 6 years and the oldest 14. The teaching advanced well and the children were attentive and bright. Their behavior can be mentioned with praise. With their parents they have taken part in the circuit assemblies, as well as in the study meetings of the company. The work has been delightful and interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are very grateful for the great help we received from our brethren in Sweden, Canada and Norway. It has made it possible for many of our pioneers to go out and continue in the Held. On account of the war, it has been very difficult to get clothing, and the little we have gotten has been very expensive. The big amounts of various kinds of clothes which by the kind arrangement of the president of the Society were sent from Sweden and Canada provided many of our full-time workers with necessary clothes. How grateful have the workers been for this provision! Brethren from Norway have sent food packets to our pioneers, who many times have special difficulties with their food, as well as with their lodging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the many outstanding and much appreciated items for this service year was the return of the 4 Gilead graduates who had had the privilege of being graduated from the Bible School and by your kind arrangement were sent back to Finland. Gilead had been beaming to us as an unattainable star which we admired from afar, but to which, we thought, we never should reach. Now we are very thankful and glad for having four Gilead graduates among us, and we have seen that Gilead is worthy of this name, because the schooling of our brethren there has turned out to be a good “heap of testimony” in our country, both directly and indirectly. That far-away twinkling star, Gilead, has in this way become a near-by sun which warms and lights us with its Theocratic effect, and to which—no wonder—many hope to attain sometime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most appreciated event of the service year was, no doubt, the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel, in .Tune. The brethren had been eagerly waiting for the president and his secretary, and on June 11 the American visitors finally arrived by steamer at Turku, the former capital of Finland. The Branch servant and some 50 publishers from the Turku company were there to meet the long-expected guests and to welcome them. On the way to Helsinki the travelers stopped to inspect the Kingdom Farm, making some suggestions concerning the wmrk there and its arrangements. At 6: 30 p.m. the brethren were in the Bethel home, being soon busily engaged in the preconvention work. In addition, many improvements were made so as to bring the Branch work into line with the general Theocratic arrangements world-wide. In accordance with the American Branch, here too appointments were made for Bethel servant, office servant, factory servant, and farm servant; and it is believed that the work henceforth will move along more smoothly at the Bethel home. The family very much appreciated the kind care for its welfare shown by the American brethren; and It is a matter of fact that a true family relationship was established during the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel which we were lacking before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In connection with the visit a convention was held In Helsinki, with more than 3,000 of the brethren present. It was certainly very encouraging, because we, to this point, never had so many publishers in the field. The assembly was the most thrilling and enjoyable feast ever held by the Lord’s people in this country, and blessings upon blessings were poured upon the conventioners: the releasing of the booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government,</span><span class="font4"> the convention paper, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> which was a real surprise for the brethren, and a new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”;</span><span class="font4"> many powerful discourses by the American brethren, including the statement by the president concerning the reorganizing of the Branch work; and the public address, the climax of the assembly, with 5,300 listeners, out of whom more than 2,000 were strangers. It was a joy, too, when 184 new publishers were immersed as a symbol of their consecration to do Jehovah’s will. The Finnish people in general are very stiff and calm, and they rarely reveal their emotions, even in rare occasions; but during this blessed convention the enthusiasm ran high and it was not unusual to observe tears of joy in the eyes of the elderly publishers, and from time to time stormy applauses interrupted the speakers. The brethren were grateful, too, when the president in one of his discourses set forth for his audience the great issue and explained the matter of neutrality. It was delightful to hear how the brethren world-wide had held their neutral position amidst the great conflict of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year just ended has indeed been a very marvelous one, and we find no words to express our deeply-felt gratitude to our God Jehovah, who has poured out such great blessings upon us. We can do nothing else than pray that he may help us to use all our faculties in the most effective way to glorify his holy name in helping the people of good-will to find the truth so that they also may join with us in singing his praise. We use also this occasion to express our great thankfulness and warm love for all the help and encouragement which we have got from you, dear Brother Knorr, and the head office In Brooklyn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The servants of the Most High in France worked diligently during 1947, fighting for liberty and true worship. It was their keen desire to be recognized by the government of the land as a people worthy of carrying on their true worship. During the war, because of Catholic action and hysteria, a ban was placed upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and the law prohibited their activity as an organized group. The French brethren filed papers for the organization of a French Society of Jehovah’s witnesses, and for the entire year this matter moved from one department to another in the government offices. Our attorneys did all that they could to get this new Society recognized and to show to the police and all departments of the government the good work that the Society would do, pointing out the Christian educational activity in which Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged. However, it was only because the brethren themselves vigorously pushed this matter in all the governmental departments that we finally received advice that the Society was recognized by the government and that they had a right to proceed under their new charter. Just at the close of the year the Branch office cabled the Brooklyn office, “Home secretary signed decree. Society recognized. Praise Jehovah.” This brought great joy to all the brethren in France as well as making glad the hearts of the American brethren, because it opens the way in 1948 for real organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant in Paris sends in a very interesting report, and in reading it one can feel the joy and gladness of heart possessed by the brethren. The Lord has been good to our brethren there; and, while excellent progress has been made during the service year, with an increase of more than 200 publishers, 1948, we believe, will be the great expansion year in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hearts of the French brethren began to beat with expectation and joy when they first heard that Brothers Covington, Franz, and Suiter, directors of the Society, would visit France and hold conventions In various parts of the country. For eight years no assemblies had been held in France, and 80 percent of the brethren had never attended such a gathering of the Lord’s people, as many of them had only heard of the truth and become associated with the Society during and after the war years. The conventions surpassed even the best expectations of the brethren, as a total of 6,500 assembled in the cities of Lyon, Strasbourg, Paris and Douai, which was eight times as many as in any previous French assemblies. The brethren were greatly strengthened by the discourses and felt nearer than ever to Jehovah’s organization. We were also privileged to have Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel meet in Paris with Brother Covington to take care of some Branch problems, and 800 of the brethren assembled in Paris for some final words of encouragement in Kingdom activity, which were delivered by these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people of postwar France are now looking for better times and the amelioration of their difficult conditions. However, despite the hard labor of the people to better the lot of the nation, conditions seem to get worse instead of better. Because of this, the ears and hearts of numerous people are now being opened to receive the testimony of the new world, and Jehovah’s witnesses have been welcomed in their preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In years past the brethren gathered in little family groups, but beginning with this year all companies hired halls in which all the brethren could meet for study and service meetings. This has contributed greatly to the unification and the expansion of the work in France. Although we lost a great number of brethren who returned to their homes in Poland, others have quickly stepped in to take their places. Despite a hard winter, which was made doubly so for the brethren in France because of lack of fuel, the work has not suffered, but has gone ahead ; and such has been the increase that a number of companies have been subdivided into units, as in Paris, where there are now three units. So the number of publishers is steadily increasing, and we ended our service year with 2,380 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because the Bethel home, office and literature stocks were in three different locations 20 kilometers apart, collaboration was very difficult and much time was lost traveling on the railway and subway. Therefore it was with much gladness that we greeted the president’s instructions to sell the old home in the suburb and purchase a suitable home in Paris. This matter was finally resolved by Brother Knorr during his visit to Paris, and now the Society owns a well-constructed house in a quiet section of Paris where the whole Bethel family works and dwells together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in the office and shipping department has all been done by eight brethren who rejoice in the privilege they have of serving their brethren throughout France. We were very glad to receive some supplies of literature from the Brooklyn office; and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> in the French, Polish and German languages are supplied to the companies by the French office. Although there is a great scarcity of paper, we have been able to print 115,200 booklets, 255,087 Bible studies, 52,400 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> and 282,000 forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank Jehovah above all that we have always had sufficient funds to press forward in the expansion work; and, despite the expensive living conditions, we have lacked nothing, even now being provided with a new Bethel home which we so much needed In order to get better organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the brethren were interrogated at the offices of the local police as well as by the gendarmes. No real difficulty has ever come of the matter, however, as in nearly all cases the brethren were able to continue with their work after explaining their good service as Christian ministers of the gospel. In only one case was a brother denounced by a gendarme and taken to court, but he defended his Christian course of action and was acquitted by the judge.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>FRENCH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">1 am very glad to be able to give you, dear Brother Knorr, a favorable report concerning Afrique Occidentale et Equatoriale Franfaise, that is to say, Ivory Coast, Togo and Cameroun. Every day we receive letters from these countries in which the brethren write us to order literature and tell of their joy to know of God’s purposes and the gospel of his kingdom. The work is going ahead well, especially in Cameroun, where there are now two companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, one in Douala, and the other a company of about 50 brethren at N’kongsamba. No doubt additional companies can be formed in the near future. We have the addresses of approximately 50 other persons of good-will in these countries whom we are also keeping supplied with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other literature. In the coming year we plan to do all we can to help these brethren and the people of good-will in these countries to know Jehovah’s organization for true worship and to have a part in singing the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking back at the end of the 1947 service year, we can say from deeply thankful hearts: “Praise the Lord, all ye nations; for great is his kindness toward us.” Jehovah has opened the way for a great new work in France. We are now recognized as a Society by the state, and have already obtained a fine Bethel home. The groundwork Is well laid for the performance of great activity throughout France in honor of the King and the Kingdom. This means hard work, but also great joy and many blessings for those who share in the work. The work in France will go ahead, to the end that all who breathe may praise Jehovah!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The conditions in Germany are not at all happify-ing. According to the Branch servant’s report, which cannot all be published herein, conditions are getting worse and worse as far as the people in Germany are concerned. The shortage of food, the housing shortage and lack of clothing all go to make the outlook very grim for the future, and especially for the coming winter. Despite all the despair, Jehovah’s witnesses move ahead with real joy, singing the praises of God and aiding the “other sheep” to gain a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A marvelous increase has been accomplished only by the Lord’s grace, and many people of good-will have been gathered together. Public meetings have played a tremendous part in getting the message to the people. The circuit assemblies have helped in the organization of those who love righteousness and want to engage in ministerial work. The many meetings that have been held indicate the real hunger on the part of the people for the truth. The lecture that attracted the greatest attention during the year was the one entitled “Jehovah’s witnesses in the Crucible”. This was delivered 694 times during a six-month period to audiences totaling more than 120,000. This lecture has aroused the Hierarchy, and they have brought much persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses. But, despite all this, the work grows rapidly, because the Lord’s servants in Germany are taking the same stand as they did before World War II. They are taking their stand for God and his kingdom and, therefore, receive his rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Portions of the Branch servant’s report are set out here, which will make glad the hearts of all readers. This report should cause all the publishers throughout the world to be more determined than ever to devote their time and energy to the service of God; for they are able to do it under much more favorable conditions than our brethren in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new arrangement of circuits, the regular visits of the servants to the brethren, and the circuit assemblies, prove to be a great blessing in this country. Certainly this arrangement comes from the Lord, because nobody could think out something that would serve better to the strengthening and establishing of Jehovah’s covenant people and his Theocratic organization. So from all parts of the country we get news and reports which show that the visits of the servants to the brethren are welcomed with delight in all companies. This is especially the case where the servant to the brethren keeps strictly to organization instructions in performing his tasks. The threads of order become stronger and the group and pioneer work is progressing. The organization is tightening and the publishers become more aware of their responsibilities and privileges, and peace and unity in the companies are increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in last year, also in this year a number of public lectures have been given over the wireless in western Germany. These proved to be of great advantage for the work concerning the gathering of the “other sheep”. Short lectures have been sent from Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Baden-Baden and Hamburg, whereas there would not open' any possibility to proclaim the truth over the air in eastern Germany. Yet the radio stations in Berlin and Leipzig have broadcast quite good reports about our conventions there, which reports gave a favorable picture of our organization. Also in this sphere the influence of the Hierarchy is clearly to be seen. It is she that tries in sullenness to silence the voice of Jehovah’s witnesses in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through our lecture “Christians in the Crucible” the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church recognized our fearless stand. The many truthful proofs of her alliance with the Nazis and Fascists in the past, and the uncompromising attitude of Jehovah’s witnesses, are making them quite disconcerted. They now organized the young men from their associations, real “storm troops”, called “Kolpingsohne” (sons of Koiping, famous Catholic). With these seditious hordes they are keeping up the methods of the Nazis in trying to disturb and to break up the lectures and assemblies of divine service of Jehovah’s witnesses. They like to kick up a row inside the hall, very similar to the methods of the SS and SA. Those “Christian” ruffians even do not shrink back from using the knife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whereas assaults of this kind are not known in the Protestant east of Germany, some severe attacks have been reported in the British and American zones. It started in Regensburg and other places in Bavaria, and now cases of Nazi-Catholic intolerance are also making their appearance in the British zone. They try all means and methods to silence the warning voice of Jehovah’s witnesses. In Verden on the Aller stink gas was used to bring the lecture to an untimely end. In Paderborn it is the town council, which seeks to hinder our brethren from holding their meetings of worship by canceling without notice the schoolrooms, in which the meetings used to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two brothers as representatives of the Society from our office in Wiesbaden traveled to Paderborn to give two public lectures as protest against this unchristian and unfounded attitude of the town council. Because they could not find adequate rooms they chose the place before the town hall with permission of the English military government. In spite of this permission the aidermen of the town tried to prevent the assembly by forbidding the brethren to use the place. When, at 4 p.m., the time when the lecture was to take place, hundreds of people were assembled before the town hall, they had to be told that the town had forbidden the use of this place and had threatened to make use of their domestic right and have the place cleared by the police. But spontaneously the people followed the invitation to go to another place near by, which was not the property of the council, and there the speech was delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of the year was the long-expected joy of the visit of the Society’s president. And the Lord blessed this visit above all expectations. To our regret it had to be restricted this year to western Germany only, but we are sure that Brother Knorr had the special guidance of the Lord when he permitted Brother Covington once more to come to Germany and to visit Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Brother Knorr’s advice we refrained from having a general convention in Germany on occasion of his visit. So it happened that only at the very last hour, about nine days before its beginning, an assembly was arranged in western Germany. In spite of this short term and inadequate preparations we had a richly blessed assembly in Stuttgart. Seven thousand brethren came and appreciated the privilege to hear and to see face to face the president and his two companions, Brother Henschel and Brother Covington. Brother Covington’s trip to different assemblies In Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover and Essen caused great joy and gratitude by the brethren assembled at these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are engaged In the erecting of our new building In Wiesbaden. In spite of the very difficult conditions in all fields of the building trade, we are hoping that in one year’s time we shall have the building completed to the extent that we can move into the office, the printing plant, and the bedrooms for the family. Then we shall also in this place work with all energy to help the companies and to further the work of proclaiming the Kingdom in the whole country. It is very difficult to get and to transport the necessary building material; and it is very difficult to find a way to get the brothers who are needed as workmen, but who are today tied and kept by their local employment offices. But as the erection of our buildings in the east of Germany, in Magdeburg, came to pass as by a miracle of the Lord, so he will also be with us In the west, in Wiesbaden, and we are full of confidence that also over there everything will be accomplished to his honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special providence of the Lord is to be seen in the event of evacuation of our brethren, who had to leave the eastern provinces when these became occupied by the Poles. Many hundreds out of Silesia and East and West Prussia had to leave their homes and came into the weslern zones. Telegrams were sent to our offices from these pitiable ones who were robbed of everything they had, asking advice as to what to do. Some uttered the wish to settle in common. But they were advised by our offices to put their trust in the Lord and to leave their settling entirely to the authorities. Certainly nothing would happen without the guidance of the Lord, who would be able to destine their lot as in the days of the first Christians, where “they<sup>7</sup> that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word”. So it happened that the majority of these brethren were settled in the British zone and just in the blackest Catholic district. They started to go from house to house, to make back-calls and arrange back-call book studies, and now one company after another is forming in these large districts where within the memory of men no beam of the light of divine truth has been shining. More than 1,500 of such faithful witnesses of the Lord have been brought out of Silesia into those absolutely Catholic parts of the country. These light-bearers of the Kingdom are stirring up the nests built in former times by the Hierarchy and are greatly disturbing the monks and priests in their slumber. Their howling rouses the suspicion even of their most ardent churchgoers. One of these “pastoral caretakers” was once called to give “extreme unction” to an old granny of some family, but he did not turn up. After the granny had died, the family complained and the priest declared moanfully the Bible Students were to give a lecture, which he had to prevent in any case and in his “official zeal” he had forgotten his official duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How great was the joy in many cases when occasionally at the circuit assemblies shares from the American and Swiss donations were distributed. If the clothes received would not fit, they were altered to fit or exchanged for articles of the proper size. The circuit assemblies became also a special joy for the evacuated brethren, as a certain compensation for the tribulations of the past months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So has the relief work through the Society caused much joy and proved to be a blessing in this country. The rich gifts of the American, Swiss, Swedish and other brethren have often evoked an unspeakable joy in the receivers. One can imagine scenes, as described in some of the letters received at this office, when faithful, wholly consecrated persons, whom starvation had changed to skeletons, unpacked their parcels from America or Sweden kneeling and crying! Touching letters from these pitiable fellow servants give an idea of their prayers ascending out of deeply-moved hearts to our heavenly Father, praising him and thanking him for the unexpected joy, prepared through loving hands in a foreign country. Poor and needy publishers still receive continuously such gift parcels, to their joy and strengthening to further service. That does not mean that It is possible to keep the hunger from the Lord’s faithful people. Oh, no I The needy ones are too many, and too great is the misery. But the Lord will see to it that in his own good time this condition will be lifted. All know that and nobody is doubtful about it, but each endures in great patience and witli a proud joy this “our light affliction, which is but for a moment”, knowing that such attitude secures a share in the great work of vindicating Jehovah’s holy name. Just as in the case of Job, an imperishable reward will replace the sufferings of all those who trust wholly in the Lord and who do not impute to him anything absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just during these days, when the year’s report is in preparation, the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> came from America with the news that at the great convention in Los Angeles the president made the suggestion to the many thousands of assembled brethren that the German and Austrian brethren be supplied with food and clothing. What a joy and jubilant sound that will cause in our country!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Out of the same </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> we see as well that the number of publishers in the whole world has reached 200,000. Just today, the 12th of September, we have established the fact here in Magdeburg that the total number of publishers in Germany is now 20,811. That means that here in this country, so poor and so plundered, lives a tenth of all publishers of the new world and of the fighters for the honor and supremacy of Jehovah God. That makes our joy perfect and helps us to forget the sad and miserable conditions. It is a visible proof of the great blessing the Lord has bestowed upon the service that has been done under so much hardship and so much privation and want. There is a continuously increasing joy of the Kingdom streaming out of our hearts, and we have the invincible will to make greater efforts to his honor and to the benefit of the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The German Bethel family in Magdeburg, as in Wiesbaden, considers it as a marvelous privilege to serve the Lord in this place, dedicated to him. With all energy and ever-renewed joy everyone does his service in his appointed place and does not miss any opportunity to have a share in the field service or any other feature of service. All the brothers and sisters -remember with great joy and gratitude the blessed hours of fellowship with our president and Brothers Henschel and Covington. They all feel themselves united with all faithful fellow workers all over the earth. They send their brothers and sisters in Brooklyn and throughout the world their love and best wishes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece have undergone a bitter religious-political persecution as they have sought to push the advance of true worship in that land. The church and government are against Jehovah’s witnesses and have put forth every effort possible to stop the circulation of the literature and the proclamation of the gospel. To aid the brethren in Greece two graduates from Gilead were sent to the Branch office, and they have been a real help in organizing the work. However, the government is determined to have these two brethren deported from the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message that Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching in Greece is the same message that is being preached in the United States, but the Greek Orthodox Church does not want this message for their people. The United States government is spending millions and millions of dollars in Greece; and the president of the United States claims that there is freedom of speech in Greece, but the facts show otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to print the entire report as furnished by the Branch servant, but the portions that are herewith printed will give the reader some idea of what is going on’in Greece. Faithfulness to God comes at great price, but Jehovah’s witnesses in Greece prefer to have the favor of God rather than the favor of men who are opposed to God and to righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prevailing conditions in this country have given the government and the Orthodox Church, the state religion of Greece, the needed excuse to clamp down on the work. Full-scale civil war has been raging for over two years, which has further hindered the service activities. Throughout Greece bands of men, generally led by the Communists, have been waging their bloody attacks against the present government. The battlefield is everywhere. The only safe places have been the cities, but of late some of these have been invaded and homes burned. During the daytime the government is able to hold control of the country, but at night the guerrillas take over. Travel between most villages is not permitted, and many have to get permits to work on their own farms outside of the town. To combat these guerrillas the government has organized local-citizen organizations in every town and village, known as “Hetis”, which are armed by the government; and these, of course, take the authority into their own hands. They generally are fanatical religionists and have caused us much trouble. With this general unrest, the matter of serving in the armed forces has been raised. There being no exemption for ministers of the gospel from military duty, the brethren have bad to take the consequences of not serving. There are a large number in army prisons, where they are standing fast under very trying conditions, but the Lord upholds and protects his servants in their faithful stand. Some have been tied and beaten for several hours with barbed wire in an attempt to break their integrity, but in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As none of the companies have Kingdom Halls, all meetings are held In the private homes of the brethren. Our problem and the need for exercising care to safeguard these meetings can best be illustrated by the following case similar to many, many others. At Karkara, near Salonika, seven brethren were assembled at their weekly study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The police came and hauled them to the station, where one of the officers started beating the brethren with a club. One brother was struck in the eye and was blind for many days thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almost all the companies at one time or another have had their meetings broken up, the brethren maltreated and brought to trial, some before martial courts. This has necessitated small group studies rather than having the entire company come together; and thus some companies have as many as twelve </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> studies and four service meetings a week. Occasionally it is necessary to change the places of study because the brethren have been warned of an impending raid by the police. In Athens and vicinity the units are practically in the last homes available because the others are known and watched by the police. Now they alternate their days and hours of meeting to minimize the possibility of discovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In an endeavor to overcome this problem, several visits were made to the chiefs of the government police, who not only refused to allow us to assemble freely, but demanded that we stop our work. The director was told we would not stop 1 Whereupon he threatened to make martyrs of all of Jehovah’s witnesses if we continued our activities! Now we have entered a petition with the Ministry of Education and Religion requesting a permit to have a Kingdom Hall as a center of worship in Athens. It is hoped that this will be issued, as it would greatly help in pushing the advance of the true worship and many people of good-will would then begin to assemble with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The end to which Satan and his dupes will go to defeat the Lord’s work is well illustrated in the following experiences: At the town of Vrontamas, a group of gendarmes or armed police of the villages, along with several “Hetis”, found Brother Tsembelis having a book study with a newly interested woman who was readily learning the truth and had made much progress. After giving both a severe beating they wanted to hang the sister, but the villagers intervened. Much torture befell the brothel<sup>-</sup> as they attempted to break his integrity by making him kiss idols, do the sign of the cross and renounce his faith. Seeing that they could not break his integrity, he was shot and killed by these officers. Other brethren in this same village were severely beaten and one sister had her arm broken because she would not make the sign of the cross. Later they ransacked all the homes of Jehovah’s witnesses in the town and then departed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two days later this same group of gendarmes and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hetis </span><span class="font4">went to the near-by village of Gortsia looking for Jehovah’s witnesses. All the homes of the brethren were searched and Bibles and other literature were taken. One sister was confronted in her home by these men, stripped naked, hanged upside down and then tortured by pouring cold water on her. Nine sisters and two brothers were then gathered into a cellar, where they all were mercilessly beaten for some time. Later the police started back to their station, taking with them all the brethren. On the way the pioneer brother was taken into the woods and executed. He was one of the best pioneer publishers. He died faithful to his commission. While on their journey one of the sisters had the opportunity to explain to the captain in charge who Jehovah’s witnesses are. He explained, “I am not to blame. You have many enemies, especially the priest, who induced me to act against you.” Two days later all the brethren were released. It should be noted that they were not doing service work nor assembling together. In both villages the police left instructions that if Jehovah’s witnesses did not start going to church, to notify them and they would return!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other objects of attack by the Greek Church have been the school children who have been denied an education because of their refusal to participate in the religious ceremonies each morning or to attend church. Some have been horribly mistreated by the teachers and other children. Lectures have been given in the classes against Jehovah’s witnesses, and later questions on these lectures appear in the examination! Notwithstanding, these young witnesses of Jehovah have stood firm, and have given a good testimony and continued to remember their Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The courts have even convicted parents because their children attend Jehovah’s witnesses’ meetings. One father was convicted for proselyting and was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment because he was bringing up his child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord! If any children are discovered in the meetings by the police, the above charge is invariably levied against all present. In further making them objects of persecution, the Church has endeavored to forcibly baptize children whose parents are Jehovah’s witnesses. The parents were powerless to do anything, and were viciously beaten by the police if they objected. Many times this inquisitional method was used, and each time it turned out to be a marvelous witness to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all these difficulties it has necessitated waging a continuous battle in the courts of the land in defense of the true worship. According to what figures we have, 706 brethren were arrested and brought to trial during the service year. Of these, 126 were convicted and sentenced from a few days to many months in prison. The others were either dismissed or postponed for rehearing. This has resulted in a very heavy financial burden to the brethren and to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One company servant observed, “A pioneer means one who is devoted to a life of prison, parole, fines and severe beatings.” Yet the faithfulness of these fighters for the New World is marvelous to behold. One pioneer brother in the city of Athens was arrested six times in twenty days and still he kept going, until the Society removed him from this territory because of the threats of bodily harm by the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most outstanding blessings of the year was your visit to Greece. Many problems were ironed out during the three days you and Brother Henschel were here. Although we could not have a convention and few of the brethren got to hear you speak, yet all were pleased with the future plans made for the Kingdom work. Everyone will remember it as a great milestone in the advancing movement of the true worship of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So at the close of this service year we can look back and see how fitting are the words at Jeremiah 1:19 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.) :</span><span class="font4"> “And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee,” and truly the Lord has delivered his servants because of their faithful stand. His protection has been manifold and It has strengthened the hands of his people to do his will. We rejoice in the privilege of service that Jehovah has granted us during the past year and look forward to the future to have a greater part in the work of praising and vindicating his word and name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>ALBANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since early this year many attempts have been made to contact the brethren in Albania, but all efforts have failed. A traveler from Albania to Greece reports that at the present time there are several companies in operation and that they are joining with all of Jehovah’s witnesses in the world, praising the name of the Most High. Very little literature comes into the country, but once in a while we learn that some has reached the brethren, and they use it in their studies. The only thing the publishers of the Kingdom can do in Albania is to preach the gospel by word of mouth and to use their Bibles. Every effort is being made by the Society to get in touch with the brethren in Albania by regular correspondence. But we are assured by a traveler that they are working and holding high the truth of the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">While Brother Knorr was in Greece he arranged for the Athens Branch office to look after the brethren in Turkey, since they were closei- and the communications were better than with the Brooklyn office. The proclamation of the message of the Kingdom in Turkey is hindered by the adversary. The Turkish government officially banned the work after reading our literature. However, at Memorial time 18 brethren came together to celebrate the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is new interest associating with the Lord’s people in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the publications that have been sent from the United States have been confiscated. Occasionally some literature gets through and it is immediately put to good use. It is loaned to the people to read, and, later, the publisher returns and tries to follow up the interest if there is any. It can thus be seen that most of the work is done by word of mouth. But the brethren are not discouraged, being thankful for the privilege of being able to serve the Lord. The Greece Branch has sent them some booklets, and efforts are being made to send them some more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite all difficulties that the brethren are having, they regularly meet together and study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> which they receive regularly. At the present time they hold their service meetings once a month. However, they have been instructed on the need of having them every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the latter part of the year the Society reorganized the brethren in Istanbul into a company with its own servant arrangement in order to push forward the work. Now the Greek </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> is being sent to them regularly. The brethren are anxious to Une up with the Theocratic organization and they are waiting for someone to visit them from this office to instruct them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Three years ago there were only three or four persons in all of Guatemala who were serving the Lord and holding high the message of truth. Now there are 75 regular publishers, with a peak reached in August of 112. Up to this time the majority of the work has been done in the capital, Guatemala city, but a few of the witnesses have now moved out into other sections and small companies have been formed in several of the other towns. It is quite easy to place literature; but the Gilead graduates who have gone to Guatemala have given good instructions to the newly interested persons, with the result that they are following through with back-calls and book studies, being keenly interested in carrying on the great educational work that Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying on throughout all the earth. Some excerpts from the Branch servant’s report show the zeal of the brethren from Gilead and tell some of their good experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ten more Gilead graduates arrived during the year, making a total of twenty now working in the capital. This necessitated the establishing of a new missionary home, getting settled and accustomed to new living conditions and becoming familiar with a new language; but they have devoted themselves to aiding the people of good-will to praise Jehovah, assisting them individually and in regular group work, to ‘stand at the door and knock’, showing them how to make back-calls, conduct their own studies, and do magazine street work, in fact, all features of service. Some who </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> year ago were attendants at book studies now have their own studies and are taking new interest out themselves. The productiveness of following Christ Jesus’ example in praising Jehovah is seen in the fact that during the twelve months of service we have had nine peaks in publishers, and instead of the two or three publishers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2%</span><span class="font4"> years ago there are now 112.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding among the experiences is that of a 16-year-old boy who began studying last September. In February he left the city for the country, but continued to study privately. His parents require him to go to school, but his desire is to praise Jehovah full-time, as evidenced by the following from a letter he wrote shortly after entering school: “In this school I shall never acquire wisdom with respect to the Word of God, the Bible, which is what I am looking for; therefore I want to include myself with Jehovah’s witnesses because in them I see the intelligence and the desire to teach others with patience and without selfish interest. I can no longer continue in absurd teachings and worldly hypotheses. I am thirsting for justice and truth, and this I can find only in the Bible. I want to establish myself on the immovable Rock, knowing that the only way of escape is the Theocratic kingdom under Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another publisher states that ‘in following up placements in my territory I started a study with a young Catholic girl’. She practically memorized the lesson. As we continued to study and she began to take her stand she met with increasing opposition from her well-to-do mother and husband. They tried to force her to go to mass, and finally burned all of her literature. Then she came to my home and we studied </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> as she also speaks English. She used two books, one to study and from the other she tore the pages out and put them In a magazine to study at home. Her family continued to oppose her; her husband threatened to divorce her. Finally they sent her to the United States, telling her she couldn’t come back until she stopped this “foolishness”. She was baptized before she left and in a month’s time returned. Since her return she has been regular in the service and takes her books home to study in front of her family and sees now how Jehovah strengthened her to stand firm on his side of the issue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country is one of the smallest republics in the Caribbean, but here, too, the message of God must go forward. A group of Gilead graduates who are now missionaries in Haiti are doing good work, but finding it difficult to arouse the interest of the people. In the previous year, 1946, there were 10 publishers, while now there are 16, of whom 6 are missionaries. A peak of publishers was reached in June, with 26, and it is hoped that these will be helped further in learning the truth and taking their stand for the Kingdom. There is much work to be done in Haiti, and we feel sure that the message will be preached here, too, the same as in all other nations of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meetings have aroused much interest in Haiti. However, when the talks are finished, very few of the people have any questions to ask. What is really needed is more book studies among those interested, and we are trying to establish these. In the early part of the service year there were 8 brethren baptized, and these are now serving the interests of the Kingdom. In addition to the brethren from Gilead a few natives have now entered into the pioneer service. These brethren have been working some outlying towns at a little distance from Port-au-Prince, where the Gilead missionaries are located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In July two of the missionaries traveled to the northern part of the island, where Haiti’s second-largest city is located, and a good witness was given to many interested people. Some of them are very anxious for the missionaries to return and continue to give them instruction in the Bible, for it is their desire to render praise to Jehovah. They can clearly see that the Protestant and Catholic organizations have nothing for them in the way of hope or life in the future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers, for a number of years, have borne the brunt of the work in the Hawaiian island-group. While they are not great in number, they still do more than half of the work that is accomplished by all the servants on the islands. This is real missionary territory. The greatest obstacle to meet is the many languages that the islanders speak, which include Hawaiian, Japanese, the various Filipino dialects, Chinese, and several others. The missionaries have done their very best to learn enough of the various languages to present the truth and then leave with the people the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant and his wife, who have been in the Hawaiian Islands for many years, have always enjoyed their service there. But the service year of 1947 has filled their hearts to overflowing, because the fruits of their labors are so manifest. They have planted and watered for years, and now Jehovah is giving the increase. The Branch servant’s report is very interesting, and shows the splendid progress of the work in the Hawaiian Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soon after the beginning of the year those brethren from Hawaii who had been privileged to attend the “Glad Nations” Assembly at Cleveland returned to Hawaii. Strengthened thereby, those who could entered the pioneer service, while some unable to do so put In greater effort and longer hours than previously. This inspired others to push on in the work with Increased zeal. Shortly thereafter came the visit of the Society’s president and his secretary to Hawaii, stopping off on their way around the world. This was the big event of the year, both in service to the brethren and by way of witnessing publicly. They arrived just in time for the first circuit assembly in the Islands and Brother Knorr in the capacity of district servant did much to encourage and stimulate the publishers in their work. That was the real beginning of the increase in number of publishers, and of time spent in the field, both of which have since continued to grow. From a low of 97 publishers and 2,700 hours, a peak of 163 publishers and a peak of total hours of 5,234 for any one month was attained. So during the year, by the Lord’s grace, there has been a goodly increase in number of publishers, and more than 10,000 increase in hours spent in field witnessing, with a consequent expansion all down the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hawaiian people are very superstitious, formerly worshiping many strange gods. They will go strongly for healing, women preachers and suchlike. Now it is good indeed to see them beginning to break away from their old traditions and grow in knowledge of Jehovah, and begin to worship him in spirit and truth. The brethren in one rural section who have been witnessing and holding book studies in the homes of Hawaiians still attending the local Hawaiian church report how the minister got up in meeting and berated his congregation for permitting outside people to come into their homes and conduct Bible studies, and told them to discontinue all such meetings at once. This was too much for one of the married couples who were enjoying the studies in “Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True”,</span><span class="font4"> and they stood right up in church and told the minister in the presence of the congregation how they had come to know and love Jehovah through these Bible studies, and that they would continue their study of the Bible whether he liked it or not, and that if he wished he could count them out of the church right then and there. This made a good witness to the others present, and now the interest and studies held with people from the same church are increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Public meetings are held in English, Japanese, Korean and Ilocano. Book studies too are conducted in the same tongues, and also in Hawaiian. The provision by Jehovah of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> has been a real boon both in feeding and in instructing the publishers themselves, as well as to others of good-will through its use in back-call book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting to note that although quite a few publishers were taken away from the Honolulu company to form the two new companies, still the Honolulu company </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">the year showed an increase of about 50 percent in publishers in spite of such loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reviewing the events of the year, and noting the way in which Jehovah led his people, and considering the stimulating nourishing food he served his people in the presence of their enemies through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and its kindred publications, with the psalmist we truly can say: “Know ye that [Jehovah] he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. ... be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For [Jehovah] is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.”—Ps. 100:3-5.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">About two years ago the Society sent its first missionaries to Honduras. This is a Spanish-speaking country, and at first the language presented a few obstacles; but the missionaries carried on diligently, learned the language, and now the expansion of the work is very evident. There are now four companies organized, due to the servant to the brethren activity on the part of the Branch servant. Last year there were 19 publishers of the Kingdom, but during the 1947 service year the monthly average of publishers had increased to 45. The brethren there rejoice in their privileges of service and appreciate that there is still much territory to be worked. Undoubtedly there are many people of good-will living in other towns where the missionaries have not as yet been able to go and preach. The Branch servant’s report is very interesting, but only a small portion of it can be printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">News of the Cleveland convention and the many joys experienced by the brethren there was what the Gilead graduates and other publishers here were waiting for. And at the beginning of the service year that’s what presented itself in the visit of T. H. Siebenlist and wife during the week of September 22-29 while on their tour of the Branches in Central America after the convention. This was an occasion of much joy for the brethren In Honduras, most of whom were very new in the truth. The talks, pictures and releases directed from the grand convention in Cleveland brought them closer to the Lord’s organization, and they were thankful for this provision of assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in November two more Gilead brethren arrived in the country ready for their assignment. Immediately the servant to the brethren together with four of the missionaries set out for the next-largest town in the republic, San Pedro Sula, which is located on the north coast about 60 miles inland from the Caribbean sea. Tiie airplane took us the long way around, making a large circle of the country before carrying us to our destination. We stopped at several other large towns along the way and we wondered how long it would be before our expansion work would take us to these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon arrival we started looking for a suitable home for the missionaries. In discussion with one homeowner we were asked, “Whom do you people represent?” We replied, “We are Jehovah’s witnesses.” “Say,” he said, “we have been waiting for you people to come here for a long time.” He went into the house and came out with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Verdad Os Hara Libres</span><span class="font4"> book in his hand, which he had obtained from a friend of his. Then he began to enumerate the people that had read the well-worn book and who wanted to hear more about it. All this, and the door-to-door work hadn’t even started! We were overjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">San Pedro Sula is the stronghold of the evangelists in Honduras, they having been organized here for twenty years or more. As a result of a public meeting lecture which was attended by four or five of the evangelists, the “pastor” devoted his Sunday sermon to roasting Jehovah’s witnesses. He called out the names of those who had dared attend a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses and publicly shamed them, so he thought. When he was through many in his congregation began to wonder what Jehovah’s witnesses did have that made their pastor so angry, for they knew personally that many of the things he said were not true. The following week another public lecture attended by more evangelists answered it for them. They learned about the new earth and the many Kingdom blessings in store for men of good-will, which will be showered down from the new heavens. W’hat a release from previous error it was to many of them! The pastor is still gnasiiing his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Memorial this year climaxed a two-day assembly for each of the companies. It was a time of increased activity in the field and an increase of joy for the brethren, as this month a new peak of publishers was reached for the country. Many new ones took part in handbill distribution for the first time, which was to start them out as regular publishers. A total of 121 gathered at the several towns to hear the public lecture Sunday afternoon, while a total of 89 attended the Memorial that night. Of the 89 attending the Memorial only 1 partook of the emblems, showing that these ‘companion sheep’ recognized their position with the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are ever thankful to Jehovah God for the much spiritual food provided through his organization. We appreciate receiving this spiritual food printed in the language of the country so the people of good-will might benefit through this means of preaching the gospel. Our gratitude is to Jehovah for his unspeakable gift which provides the means whereby the missionary work may be carried into each new country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Splendid progress is being made here despite the present difficulties in this country, which has just gone through a terrible war. Although the brethren encounter very severe opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, they have increased from 661 in 1946 to 989 in 1947. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is being printed in Hungary now, and there are thousands of subscribers. It has also been possible to obtain some paper and print booklets, which are now being distributed. A few excerpts from the Branch servant’s report show the conditions under which the brethren must work. They are going ahead rejoicing, knowing that they must stand for the Kingdom, and that alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present democratic police are no more the blind tools of the clergy, as was the case with their predecessors. For instance, soon after Hungary had been made a republic, an over-zealous “democrat” learned that Jehovah’s witnesses were speaking about some kingdom and he immediately ran to the police station, reporting that Jehovah’s witnesses were back again; that they were speaking against the republic and exercising reactionary influence. The brethren were led to the chief of police, who called them to answer for their activity. But the sergeant became very friendly as the brethren gave him a witness about the Kingdom, and he instructed the officials who had brought the brethren to him that they should not hinder these people in their work, as they were doing good. Then he turned to the brethren and said : “Go along and continue to preacli these things. I let you go free on condition that you tell this to all the people whether on the streets or in the houses so that nobody is left out. It would be very good if all people would act as you do ... ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The priest of a larger village was just leaving the church after mass and found that the place was full of Jehovah’s witnesses. Off he ran to the police and demanded that these people be stopped from going through the whole village and exciting the people there. The police commissioner, a man of good-will, answered him: ‘Go along home, Mr. Vicar, don’t be afraid of these people, because they aren’t doing anything to hurt you or anybody else. They couldn’t even force these people to take life.’ The priest disappeared ashamed and the brethren had a splendid opportunity of giving </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a good</span><span class="font4"> witness to the many people who came out of the church and who lingered in the square.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the clergy have perhaps not so much influence with the police as formerly, they still create enough enmity against us and in many cases they are successful in using under-oflicials and mobs against the Lord’s people, but, by Jehovah’s grace, these attacks often either fall back upon the attackers themselves or fail of their purpose through other circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The compulsory religious instruction In the schools is a good tool in the hand of the enemy. In this country the parents are obligated to send their children to the religious instructions of an established religious system, otherwise such children cannot make progress in school even when they are bright scholars. This causes much worry and unpleasantness to consecrated parents who have children of school age, and often leads to the children’s being expelled before they have finished their school training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our beloved brethren in Switzerland sent us a fine consignment of clothing at the beginning of this year again, to aid the brethren here in their necessity. Of this, 2,151 adults and children have received gifts of clothing, and by this means many publishers were enabled to go more suitably clad into Jehovah’s service. Above all, we are grateful to our heavenly Father and Provider for these gifts of love, but we also thank our dear brethren with full hearts that they have thought of us in our need.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are 400,000,000 persons in all of India, speaking many languages and having many beliefs and religions. Certainly there is plenty of work there for publishers. There are approximately 2,000,000 persons for each publisher now in India. By way of comparison, at the same ratio there would be but 5 publishers in New York or Greater London, 6 in all of Canada, or 4 in Australia. And it must be remembered that in years gone by there were just that few Jehovah’s witnesses in these various places; but now wonderful progress has been made. If it is the Lord’s due time for his message to break into the minds of the religious, superstitious people of India, it will be done. The servants of the Lord in India are going to try and will put forth a wonderful effort to that end. The report by the acting Branch servant is very interesting, but as it was much too long to publish in full, excerpts were taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Famine, crippled communications, riots, arson, the transfer of political power from the British to the Indian, the dividing of the country into two independent nations, curfews, massacre and civil war: in the midst of nation-wide conditions such as these the keynote struck by the servants of the Most High has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">expansion.</span><span class="font4"> Only Jehovah could thus inspire them, only his spirit could make its realization possible in such circumstances. Only by his adding his blessing to their labors could they end the year with the highest number of publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Expansion? Surely an impossibility amidst such conditions ! Humanly viewed, yes; but the Word of God is full of examples of expansion accomplished under conditions even more seemingly impossible. For nothing is impossible with Jehovah, and it is the unshakable faith of Theocratic publishers that they are “workers together with him”. Because he has given the command through his organization to expand, to “enlarge the place of thy tent”, these step forward with boldness, confident that the time for expansion at last has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very first difficulty confronting the Theocratic publisher is to find some platform upon which the minds may meet. These people have no regard for the Bible; while “reason” and “logic”, which with others serve to give them that regard, are terms learned at college and discarded at its gates. Even their words have a different meaning, making intelligible conversation almost impossible. For example, to the normal man “truth” means that which is in accordance with facts, anything contrary being untrue. But not to our Hindu graduate. Truth to him is according to the person holding it. To him a thing may be both true and not true. If you think that fire burns, then that is truth to you; and if he thinks that it does not, then that is truth to him, and both are true. He will agree that your carefully and logically balanced argument is the truth, and the next minute agree with the exact opposite. Both are true!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no such tiling as truth, there is no such thing as error. All is truth and all is error. There are no such things as evil and good; evil is good and good is evil. There is no God, there is no Satan; we are God and we are Satan. All is God. That chair upon which you sit, you think it lacks life? That is because you cannot detect its higher thoughtwaves or communicate with Its intelligence which, he says, is higher than yours. That chair is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And so it goes on. These are just samples of the mental make-up of the “educated” Hindu. The Kingdom publisher is often at a loss just where to begin his refutation. Many a patient hour has been spent teaching the Word of God to such, only to discover eventually that the contact’s attitude toward his former conception has not changed in the slightest, but that he has simply added another “truth” to the heterogeneous mass that he already holds. Yes, the publisher is true, the Bible is true, and the Ghita is true and Hinduism is true. All is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For many years a small handful of publishers have struggled against these odds, and it is to their intense joy now to see that the tide has turned and that there are certain prospects of expansion ahead. That which contributed most to this was the visit of the president to this country, the first presidential visit since 1914, and also the posting of some Gilead graduates in the country. All things point to expansion. It so happened that the arrival of the president and of the graduates coincided, and so It was an excellent opportunity for a convention. This was arranged. In addition the Branch office experienced a careful overhaul, and the Gilead brethren were given their assignment in Bombay. Arrangements were also made for literature to be translated into the vernaculars, and the companies in the country were formed into circuits with one of the Gilead brethren being appointed as district servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two of the six Gilead graduates have been assigned Bombay. These have taken the Bombay company under their wings and have established themselves as firmly in the hearts of the brethren as they have in the land of their assignment. Under their influence the Bombay company makes steady progress. They find their days very full, even as Brother Knorr predicted they would, and spend two hours of each wrestling with the Marathi language and most of the rest wrestling with the Marathi mind. Theirs is real spadework. Often at Bethel table there is a discussion on the persons they have met and how best to deal with the problems met with, and it has been a great pleasure for the Bethel family to have them with them, and they are hoping there are more to follow like them I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a country so flooded with religion as in India just anything may happen. Whatever it be, we have the sure confidence that “no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper”. The Kingdom has come, and it has come to stay. No power in heaven, no pow’er on earth, can uproot what Jehovah has planted; neither demons nor men can break down the true worship of Jehovah that he has built up in this land through his Vindicator, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As there stood faithfully in the year that was past, so there stands at the entrance of this new year, unflinching and undaunted, a small handful of people who place The Theocracy above every human government, and who are determined to meet and defeat the tremendous odds heaped against them, and prove themselves, by Jehovah’s grace, truly “a people for his name”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the course of the year just past brethren who had taken refuge in India during the Japanese occupation of Burma trickled back to their own country, swelling the company at Rangoon from 8 publishers at the beginning of the year to 24 at the end. Contact w<sup>r</sup>as re-established with some brethren who had remained in the land, and with praiseworthy zeal these unitedly entered upon their divine commission of taking a message of comfort to a war-torn and dispirited people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the early days of the brethren’s return social conditions were chaotic and the usual conveniences almost or entirely nonexistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in the midst of such conditions that the newly organized company not only served the Lord but demonstrated real enthusiasm about it, putting in an average of over 30 hours per publisher per month during the year. With creditable enterprise they overcame the lack of a Kingdom Hall by building their own from mats of woven bamboo, and displayed inside in three languages the joyful yeartext, “Oh Praise Jehovah, All Ye Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Rangoon company was little more than organized and on its feet when the good news was received that a Gilead graduate was being sent to Burma. No sooner had he landed in the country than news came through of Brother Knorr’s intended visit, and hard upon that came further good news of the dispatch of yet another Gilead brother. These things filled the brethren with joy and confidence, for it became apparent that there was much work yet to be done in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Burma, and the Lord was preparing an organization there capable of doing It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom interests have been increased in Burma over the past year, and the prospects for the year ahead are bright Indeed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since the report for Ceylon was submitted last year good progress has been made, chiefly because of the arrival of the four Gilead graduates. Until these arrived there had been regular activity on the part of one pioneer, and a few company publishers had reported sporadically. That there was real interest in the island and that there were persons of good-will desiring to serve the Lord was made manifest by the visit of the servant to the brethren two months before the graduates arrived, 19 publishers reporting service for that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their pioneer missionary home, from which the Gilead graduates operate, is situated about six miles out of Colombo proper and is located in a large compound containing hundreds of coconut palms. These nuts grow proliflcally In Ceylon. It was greatly to the entertainment of the neighborhood that one of these brethren would be seen climbing these trees, native fashion, and keeping the home supplied with all the nuts and coconut milk that it required. Daily the milkman brings his cow to the door of their house and milks it In their presence, just to prove to them that it is the Ceylon breed of cow that gives the water, not he!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real work will not begin in the island until the native population is reached in its own vernacular. In order that this may be done the Gilead brethren spend some time every day learning the Singhalese language, and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People </span><span class="font4">are being translated into that language and into the language of north Ceylon, Tamil. When these instruments are in the hands of the brethren we may expect to see the roots of The Theocracy sink deeply into the real soil of the country, the native population, for without doubt many of these are of good-will toward God and will be glad to praise him when they learn of the only life-giving government, The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>PERSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">One company publisher, a Persian national, left India for Persia and has taken with him six cartons of books. Since he left no news has been heard of him beyond a report of work accomplished on the boat on the way across. He proposes to become a pioneer there as soon as his circumstances will permit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country has about 45,000,000 inhabitants. In years gone by many of the Italians fled this land to find peace and contentment in other countries. They did not like the oppression of the Catholic-controlled country, and they sought freedom. This does not mean that the millions who remain are contented with conditions; they are not. There is a great anticlerical movement under way in Italy, particularly among the men. They are fed up with the poverty and ignorance in which the Hierarchy has kept them for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the Lord’s grace, the truth is going forward in Italy today, and it is our hope that we can bring much comfort to the people. Sicily, at the foot of the “boot”, has also received a good witness during the year, and the interested people there are being organized into study groups. There are now five graduates from Gilead in Italy. These have all taken up their residence there and are looking after the interests of the Kingdom committed into their care. The Branch that has been organized is operating well, and the servant of the Branch makes the following report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For hundreds of years the Roman Catholic Church has been, and still is, the state church in Italy. The inhabitants are about 96-percent Catholic in name only, because the majority seem to be dissatisfied with the Catholic religion, clinging to it because they know not where to go. However, in this postwar era the position of the Church In Italy is very unstable and is being challenged and attacked by anticlericalism. Jehovah’s witnesses are not to be classed with the anticlericals. Their only desire is to preach the gospel and Announce to the good people of Italy the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ as the only hope for them. If the people of Italy vote for the state church or desire to do away with it, that is their business. Jehovah’s witnesses do not mix in the political and religious doings of this world. We wait upon God’s kingdom to eliminate all wrongdoers and bring peace to humankind. Then, and only then, will the good people in Italy be able to enjoy a righteous and perfect government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The end of the war brought a measure of religious and political liberty to Italy, such as was never before enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers who were persecuted and arrested and condemned under Fascism were released and their numbers strengthened by the return of prisoners of war who had learned the truth in other countries, notably England, Australia and South Africa. These young men have become zealous publishers and have been an incentive to the organization in Italy. The time has now come for Jehovah to provide for a Branch office of the Society to be firmly established here, in order to guide and direct the brethren and organize them for efficient field service. The brethren were eager to get started, and welcomed whatever provisions the Lord would make for them through his visible earthly organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as possible after the end of World War II the Society arranged to send Gilead missionaries to Italy. The first one to arrive was sent out on the road as a servant to the brethren in November, 1946, and a few months later, in January, 1947, two other Gilead graduates arrived in Milano, where the Branch office is located. The Branch servant and his wife were to do missionary work in Milano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time soon came when the brethren inquired about the possibility of a convention, the first postwar assembly for Jehovah’s people. This provision soon came. What a joy it was to the Italian brethren when it was learned that they would have a convention in Milano and, more than that, the president of the Society would preside! This assembly was the outstanding event of the 1947 service year. It was just what the brethren needed to stimulate them for greater activity. When one considers that in Italy we had an average of 148 publishers reporting monthly during the year, the number of 225 brethren in attendance was indeed an occasion for rejoicing in the Lord. Many persons of good-will were unable to attend, due to the distance to travel and expense. Brother Knorr’s personal discourse and brotherly counsel to these brethren was enthusiastically and eagerly absorbed by all present and the brethren still remember that joyful convention day, May 16, 1947. At the public assembly an attendance of 700 persons was had at Cinema Zara in Milano, and after the discourse, ‘-The Joy of All the People,” so aptly interpreted by a young brother who learned the truth in a war camp in England, hundreds welcomed further information and practically everybody accepted literature. The response from the public as to the convention demonstrated and proved to all the publishers that the Italian people would listen to the message of the Kingdom in great numbers, and this more than anything else went to show the need for actual witness work, studies with the people, and also public meetings. If the publishers did their part and preached with all their might, there was no doubt that the Lord would give the Increase and people of good-will would listen, accept the truth, and then act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr’s visit to this land accomplished much for the Kingdom work. Henceforth, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> would be translated and published in Italy for the Italian brethren. Two young zealous Italian publishers were selected for training at the Branch before being sent out on the road as servants to the brethren. Probably some day Italy will also be represented at Gilead. These provisions were certainly a blessing from Jehovah for the advancement of the work in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year this Branch received another shipment of Bible literature, making this the second. In addition, we had printed here 50,000 copies of “Be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Glad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font4"> and 50,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses in the Crucible,</span><span class="font4"> all of which have built up our supply of literature to a fairly good measure. Translation of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> is in progress and it is hoped that the coming year will see this book published in Italian. The work being done by our brethren in Brooklyn is w<sup>y</sup>ell appreciated by us and undoubtedly demonstrates the unity that welds the organization as one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year 1947 has closed with our best monthly report thus far. We reached a new peak in publishers, and rejoice in this and numerous other blessings from Jehovah, too many to mention all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Splendid progress has been made in this island of the British West Indies. The great forward advance may be attributed to the large increase in number of back-calls, which jumped from 35,000 in 1946 to 68,193 during the past service year. The book studies also increased to 1,182. There are a million and a quarter people living on this little island. Many are interested in the Bible, and Jehovah’s witnesses are helping them to understand it. There are a number of the graduates of the Gilead school serving in Kingston, and they have helped considerably in bringing about good organization. There are 127 companies now, and 6 circuits. Throughout the entire island good attention is given to the public meeting activity, and the publishers wholeheartedly support these meetings. The Branch servant gives an interesting observation on what is going on in Jamaica now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The public meeting work here is gradually increasing. The brethren are now getting better trained in public speaking, since they have been putting to good use the ministry instruction received in the Theocratic ministry school. More speakers are qualified, and consequently more talks can be given as the smaller companies are borrowing speakers from the companies that can provide them. In the companies where the lectures are given, the work goes ahead at a faster pace. The Center unit of Kingston company rented the Race Course to put on a series of lectures. There are about 130 publishers reporting, and they advertised well with handbills and placards for these talks. The average attendance at the talks for the whole series of eight was about 1,000. One of the talks was given to an audience of 1,154!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the Jamaicans seem to be God-fearing; for on Sunday one finds many of them on their front step reading aloud the Bible. The school children are taught the Bible in school, while many of them can quote much of it by heart. The thing that many of them are just waiting for is to have someone come to them with the key to an understanding of it, so they can learn what the proper service to Jehovah is. There is no persecution of the witnesses here at all, except a little mocking now and again. It is hoped that more Gilead graduates can soon come here to look after certain sections of the territory in Kingston that are not being properly covered as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As reported last year, not many children have been publishing here; but we are happy to report this year that the parents are taking more oversight of their children and helping them to have part in the praising of Jehovah, too, by encouraging them to join them in the service. One little girl of nine years of age not long ago reported that she had three studies. One was so far away (about two miles), that she took a brother with her who lives nearer to it, in order to turn it over to him. Many of the young children can read better than the grownups; and, when they come to meetings, they sit quietly all throughout, listening, instead of whispering or running around the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So we have closed a grand year of praise to Jehovah, and the blessings are unspeakable. Last of all to mention, but not least, the service year ended with a grand climax of praising by a new peak in practically every feature. Peak In publishers, 1,411; pioneers, 79; public meetings, 108.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>JAPAN.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are a number of brethren in Japan who have been associated with the Society for some time. How many are standing firm for the Lord now instead of following a man it is difficult to say. Junzo Akashi was appointed Branch servant in 1927, and the president of the Society believed then that Junzo Akashi was wholly devoted to the Lord and believed the truths as set forth in God’s Word and explained through the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine. Just at the close of the service year, August 25, 1947, Junzo Akashi wrote a letter to the president of the Society, expressing his disbelief in the things that the Society is teaching and has been teaching for a number of years. Quoting from his letter, he states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After about A.D. 1920, however, the explanations of Scripture announced by the Society became step by step dulled, confused, and self-coutradicted.” In his letter he makes other comments showing that he did not believe what was published as far back as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> book. Still, through all these years, he played the part of a hypocrite and remained as Branch servant. He has been removed as Branch servant because of his numerous expressions in this letter to the president of the Society to the effect that he is not in harmony with any of the actions that we have taken in the great expansion work of preaching the gospel in all the world for a witness. He passes judgment on the Society ; for he says, “There is no material difference between what she [the Society] is doing and what other religious organizations are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feel certain that Jehovah God, the Great Shepherd, through his Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, will not neglect the “other sheep” in Japan, but that he will raise up someone to look to their interests so that his “sheep” will not be scattered. The Society will do everything to help those faithful Christians who believe God’s Word and are not looking to a man. Those who follow the teachings of the Lord’s Word will be led in the right way. Junzo Akashi has been told that by his own words he has proved himself to be a hypocrite, especially since 1926. The Lord had quite a few words to say about the hypocrites in his day, and they apply equally well now.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A number of years ago the government threw off the yoke of the church which had weighted down the country, and since then it has made rapid progress. However, because of the many years of slavery to the Catholic organization, there still exists only the two classes, the ultrarich and the very, very poor. Now, however, a middle class is beginning to appear. As to Jehovah’s witnesses in Mexico, the majority of them are of the poor class with regard to the material things of this world; but their zeal and obedience to the Lord is outstanding. Marvelous progress has been made by the brethren in Mexico during the 1947 service year. It would be impossible to set out all of the details, but some of the interesting experiences and high lights of the year are set forth here as reported by the servant in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord through his spirit can accomplish anything. One of our major problems is that about forty percent of the Mexican brethren cannot read or write. But this is slowly being overcome. A few years ago in one of Brother Knorr’s visits he was informed of this difficulty and, since we have a legal corporation here and are chartered as an educational organization, he encouraged all the brethren to learn to read and write and for those that knew how to read and write to teach others. His talk showed results. In turn the servants to the brethren were informed of this, and as they visited companies they mentioned to the brethren Brother Knorr's talk. One of the servants to the brethren working in southern Mexico visited the company Colonia Dolores, Chiapas. In this company there were 25 publishers and only 3 could read and write, the rest being illiterate. The servant to the brethren talked of the importance of knowing how to read and write to aid others to learn of the truth; and in his second visit around, nine months later, there were 50 publishers there, 15 of whom had learned how to read and write. On his third visit around there were 85 associated with the company and the majority had learned how to read and write. An interesting detail about this experience Is that, with the exception of three Catholic families, this whole town was composed of Jehovah’s witnesses. When they saw the unselfish work of Jehovah’s witnesses, they took an interest in the truth, and now they too are on our side. Obedience to the Lord’s will always shows results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the brethren from Gilead relates the following interesting experience: “About a year and a half ago a friend of mine in New York sent me the name of a person of good-will living here in Mexico. His mother, in California, had originally witnessed to her. As soon as possible I visited the lady and found her to be very much interested. She took all the recent publications in Spanish, including a Bible, and subscribed for both magazines. The following week I started a study with her. When I came for the study, her living room was full of people she had invited, including her sister, son and daughter. The sister immediately asked for a study in her house, which was in another suburb. Her living room, also, was full of people when I went, and among them was a friend who wanted a study for her family too. Each of these studies progressed rapidly and shortly the ladies were coming to the hall. Then the lady with whom I had the original study died, and the last thing she said to her children was that they should continue studying, which they are doing. Soon afterward her sister became a publisher. Her son and a daughter of another person with whom I study married and moved to California. Within a few weeks the mother of my friend who originally found this good-will in the States met them while working from house to house and is now studying with the young couple. Three months ago another son married. His wife came from a Catholic family that was very much against the truth. The wife, however, heard one lesson and decided that she wanted more. Now she has thrown out all her ‘saints’ and she in turn has been practically thrown out by her family, and now has her own private book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“So from the one back-call slip, sent all the way from California to New York and to Mexico city, there are now in progress five studies with people who, without doubt, will soon form a part of the ‘great multitude’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has been gracious to us in the last service year, permitting us to reach a new peak in publishers of 4,867 and giving us an attendance of over 9,000 in the Memorial services. The whole past service year has been one of joy for us, and we climaxed it by finally starting the circuit assemblies in August. We do not have enough servants to the brethren nor any district servants, so during the vacation period three brethren from the office served as district servants in five different circuit assemblies in northern, central, eastern and western Mexico. The peak attendance at the five assemblies was 1,572, and, of these, 1,103 worked in the field during the assemblies. The majority of the brethren in these circuits could not attend because of their financial condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A tropical storm hit one of our assemblies on the Pacific coast, and, even though the hall was without lights and sound equipment, the assembly was a success. Twice the floor of the hall was under water and, not having any other equipment to use, the brethren used their bare hands and sandaled feet to sweep out the water. In a short while the hall was ready to be used again. One of the most interesting things about the Mexican brethren is that problems are not things that hinder their paths, but just temporary things which they automatically overcome. Their hard and rugged lives and their day-by-day existence do not dampen their Theocratic spirit, because they will go to any extreme to carry on the witness work. Their spirit is truly wonderful to behold. As for proof of their zealousness and how it affects the Roman Church, read the following circular which is distributed in this country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Don’t be Surprised I Those agents of a Protestant sect vulgarly called Jehovah’s witnesses and also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia,</span><span class="font4"> if they haven't called at your house yet, without a doubt they will. These individuals, that zealously follow their cause, try to sell or give away well-presented books and booklets which are published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., of Brooklyn, N.Y.. U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In case you do have some of these books or booklets, destroy them immediately or give them to a Catholic priest. And, even if you are not a Catholic, if you love your country, do not co-operate in any way whatsoever with these sectarians that are supported by strong North American societies which are trying to take from us, the Mexicans, the only common bond which continues to hold us together: The unity of faith under the maternal care of the virgin of Guadalupe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Study your Catholic Religion and don’t pay any attention to these jabberers who are trying to fool you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Diocesan Committee of the A.C.J.M. (Y.M.C.A.)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will take more than the Catholic Church and rough weather and difficult living conditions or anything else that the Devil uses to break the faith that Jehovah’s witnesses have in God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all the obstacles that the war and the postwar conditions have heaped upon the people of the Netherlands, Jehovah’s witnesses have pushed right ahead with the Theocratic organization. Marvelous progress in Kingdom service has been made, and Jehovah’s witnesses in Holland are thankful for their blessed privileges of service. They appreciate the need of organization instructions and have complied with them. The Branch servant’s report shows the joy of the Lord’s people in the Netherlands and what they are accomplishing by his grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without any question of doubt, the earnest application of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> lias been the greatest factor in bringing about this progress and better conditions in the Theocratic organization. While these instructions were first introduced in the Netherlands in March, 1946, yet it has taken much time in changing over from the methods of operation the brethren were accustomed to during the war years and immediately after the war to the new methods as outlined in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font4"> During the war years the brethren had to use very rigid instructions and methods of work in order to carry on with the preaching of God’s kingdom in spite of the vigilant watch of the oppressive enemy. Such instructions and methods of work were quite proper for that period of time because the circumstances required the taking of such steps, and we know that such had the Lord’s rich blessing, because of the wonderful increase during the war years. But with the ending of the war came a great need for new instructions; instructions that would better care for the thousands of new publishers ; instructions that would teach all those publishers how to more efficiently take care of the great field of witnessing that the postwar world offered to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A comparison of figures of the service work in the Netherlands from 1939 until the present year of 1947 not only shows the splendid increase of the Lord’s organization during and after the war, but also shows the certain benefits that always result from a diligent application of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span><span class="font4"> In 1939 there were about 400 publishers reporting in the Netherlands; the end of the war in May, 1945, revealed 2,300 publishers. In .Tune of this year we had a new all-time peak of 4,247 publishers, associated with 102 companies and units. Yes, in this little country wrested from the waves, expansion is an actuality too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time we had summer vacation pioneers enrolled this year. And we surely don’t regret that we did! This arrangement was received enthusiastically by the young brethren, and many responded to the call, so that the total number of full-time servants that were on the list in August of this year was 204, to compare with 114 in June of this year. Daily praising their heavenly Father gave some of them so much joy that they wanted to continue as general pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special-publisher work in the Netherlands has brought forth remarkable results that are truly gratifying to consider. This work began in June, 1946, by assigning four pioneers in the city of Maastricht, a city of 33,000 inhabitants in the province of Limburg, in the very southeastern corner of the Netherlands. This city is very predominantly Catholic and until the entry of the special publishers there was no organized company of Jehovah’s witnesses, neither was there any definitely known interest. But within a very short time the special publishers have accomplished a work that is amazing. At the end of August we received the first report card from the newly organized company of 11 publishers, and since that time the reports have shown a gradual increase until Maastricht now has a well-established company of at least 18 publishers who are averaging at least 30 hours a month per publisher. In the month of August 1947, they averaged 46 hours. Already'the new company has produced from its ranks one general pioneer and three summer vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure, such bee-like activity of the special publishers in bringing about these results did not escape the attention of the Catholic church in Maastricht; in fact, the “stinging” just got a bit too much for her. It was not long after the specials had begun their work of preaching of God’s kingdom to the inhabitants of Maastricht, that a small pamphlet entitled “Look Out, Poison!” began to be circulated about the city. Before looking inside of this small folder, the reader’s attention is drawn to a very grim-looking skull and crossbones near the top of the cover page, the three abovementioned words at the middle of the page, and a large exclamation mark near the bottom. The supposed-to-be very “ominous” contents read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“You certainly cannot buy poison in the stores to take your life, or the life of someone else. But you can buy poison at the doors from the witnesses of Jehovah, that will not only poison you, but will also take the life from the soul of others. They make themselves appear very pious and have their mouths filled with devout proverbs, but at the same time they are selling a slow-working poison. The blue book, entitled ‘Children’, and the ‘free’ pamphlets are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">life endangering</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">forbidden literature.</span><span class="font4"> They want to take the faith of our fathers from the heart of us Catholic Limburg folk. But that nevbb! Beware of these witnesses of Jehovah. They are ‘false prophets that come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within they are rapacious wolves’. (Matt 7:15) Door tight, to ‘Jehovah’s Light’!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you think for a minute that such an ominous-reading pamphlet frightened many of the good folk of Maastricht (including Catholics) into not even daring to look at any of the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses? Quite to the contrary ! This pamphlet no sooner began to circulate when many of the good people of Maastricht began to sit up and take notice of these “famous” Jehovah’s witnesses that were around them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following letter from a brother shows the extent to which a religion-weary person of good-will appreciates the truth when once having heard it :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I was given the address of an interested person, and made a back-call. The man was the director of a large factory, who at one time was connected with a religious organization, but became disgusted with what he saw practiced there and refused to have anything more to do with religion. After having started a book study in his home, he made the following proposal to me. He said, ‘Sir, by studying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book and after having heard several of your public talks, I can see that there is only one organization upon the earth that can bring about real peace among men, and that is the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. I have a large factory and office force and I would appreciate it very much if you would come to iny office and tell my staff something about this.’ I arranged to deliver a public talk to his friends. At the appointed time I went to the office and saw that he had arranged everything as promised: a large room had been made ready for the talk and chairs all stood side by side. The director himself acted as chairman. After having given the public talk, I explained our work to the listeners and was able to place 4 books and 6 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazines. I was asked to come back. The next visit was spent solely in answering their questions, with the result that I was asked to conduct a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book with the whole staff. I placed 10 books and 10 question booklets and am now conducting a book study with them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An outstanding event of the past year that brought us great pleasure was the visit of our two American brethren, Fred Franz and Grant Suiter. They were with us for eight days in the month of June, the first three days of their stay with us falling on June 13, 14 and 15, wffien w<sup>T</sup>e had our big convention in Amsterdam which was specially arranged because of their visit with us. This convention was a great joy and pleasure for all the brethren, especially so because of the many discourses they were privileged to hear Brothers Franz and Suiter give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following this event we had the pleasure of having the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, together with his secretary-companion, Brother Henschel, in our midst, although their stay with us was very short. The days they were with us were very busy ones in talking and checking over the various matters pertaining to Kingdom interests. During the second night of their visit with us the brothers gave discourses to the Amsterdam company of Jehovah’s witnesses (making up an audience of about 1,000 persons), about points of interest on the round-the-world trip they had made thus far, and Brother Knorr concluded the occasion with a very timely discussion of Romans 14 that afterwards raised many comments of appreciation over the admonition given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We wish to take advantage of the opportunity afforded us in this report to give an expression of our thanks to the Society and the brethren in America and Canada for the many tons of clothing that it was the privilege of our Branch to receive for distribution to needy brethren throughout the Netherlands. Words are hardly adequate to express our appreciation, but we do want our brethren to know that we deeply value the sacrifice that they made on our behalf and to know that we are all the more drawn together with them in the bonds of Theocratic love and unity. In all we received three shipments of clothing from the United States and one from Canada, the four shipments consisting of 313 cases of used clothing, 35 cases of used shoes, and 11 cases of used bedding. The four shipments together made up a net weight of 54.6 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to the status of the Society with the government and other authorities, it can be said now that this is far more favorable than in the previous year. It is well known now that the Society is a clean organization with policies guided by Christian principles of truth and righteousness. It is known, too, that we are not a bunch of seditious booksellers, but a powerful international, educational, charitable organization, an organization of Christian ministers, that is doing a good and practical work for the “spiritual and moral reconstruction” by supplying the needy people of the Netherlands with strong spiritual food with which they can feed and strengthen their minds and so be protected against being dragged into the pit of delinquency and immorality by the masses that are unable to resist the subtile dangers of this postwar era.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Four and a half centuries ago John Cabot caught his first glimpse of this new-found land after crossing the stormy seas of the Atlantic. Later he organized a fishing colony to come to this island and carry on a fishing industry. Practically all of the population of Newfoundland today are fishermen. They live in hundreds of small villages and hamlets along the island’s rugged 6,000 miles of coastline. These people are meek and humble and are glad to hear the truth. The Society’s boat “Hope” reaches many of these fishing villages and has brought much comfort to the people. Graduates of Gilead were sent to Newfoundland to aid in the expansion work a few years ago, and they have proved to be “fishers of men”. The Branch servant’s report is very interesting, and a brief excerpt therefrom is published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first month of the 1947 service year brought with it certain events that betokened an expanding of the witness work in this land. Seven Newfoundland delegates arrived back from the convention at Cleveland filled with zeal and enthusiasm engendered there. Two others, natives of Newfoundland, who had attended the convention, did not immediately return but accepted the gracious invitation of the Society to stay in the United States for several months to attend the eighth class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Also during September, the new property purchased in St. John’s was occupied by the brethren. It consists of an eight-room house which is used as the Branch headquarters and missionary home, together with an adjacent building which has been converted into a commodious Kingdom Hall for the St. John’s company. Yes, the Kingdom work in Newfoundland was expanding!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">October brought its blessings to the Newfoundland “fishers of men”, for during this month they had their own Newfoundland “Glad Nations” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses In St. John’s. For the three joyous days of October 18, 19 and 20, eighty brethren enjoyed in a limited way some of the delicacies dished up at Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in the rest of the world, the cold, wintry months of January, February, March and April were special months of activity for the Newfoundland “fishermen”. Subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font4"> were the watchwords. A high quota of 600 new subscriptions was set. At the end of April the tally showed that 720 had been obtained. Had not Jehovah God blessed us? In February the two Newfoundlanders who had attended the eighth class at Gilead, and who had both graduated with merit, returned to this land to apply their wealth of newly-acquired knowledge. Opportunity knocked for them in more ways than one. They had studied Spanish at Gilead, and even knowing they were to return to the English-speaking country of Newfoundland, they applied themselves to this study. They had not been back more than a month when a Spanish fishing boat came to St. John’s to effect repairs and was destined to stay here for two or three months. Our Gilead brethren lost no time. They found all the sailors Catholic in name but, upon hearing of the blessings of the Kingdom, they became extremely interested and obtained literature and Bibles In their own language. Arrangements were made to invite them to the Kingdom Hall in St. John’s to listen to a public lecture in Spanish. As many as 18 came. Two such lectures were delivered by the newly-arrived Gilead brethren before the Spanish ship left port.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s 50-foot motor launch “Hope” began operations June 18. The boat Is a very effective method of reaching the isolated outports and fishing villages. Sound equipment mounted on the boat aids in the public lecture work. After a few weeks of back-call work in the zone of last year’s operations, the boat came to St. John’s, in that Newfoundland was going to be blessed with another convention In July with Brother Knorr here in person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because a president of the Watch Tower Society had not visited Newfoundland since the days of Pastor Russell, Brother Knorr’s visit here July 11-13 was an event of keen interest to the Lord’s people on the island. A three-day convention in St. John’s was arranged. Nearly all the brethren in Newfoundland are fishermen by trade and, since July is one of their busiest months, many could not attend the assembly. However, over eighty brethren convened and helped to advertise Brother Knorr’s public lecture, “Permanent Governor of All Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s boat “Hope” flew a large banner between her masts, advertising the talk. The boat circled the harbor making spot announcements from the sound equipment, with which instrument Brother Knorr was able to audibly advertise his own lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The personal and intimate talks given the brethren during the convention by Brothers Knorr and Henschel touched them deeply. The whole convention program seemed to carry the theme of service and proper Christian conduct. All attending were greatly blessed and left fully determined to push the advance of true worship in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this blessed service year now in the past, Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland are determined not to sit down and rest and to watch the time clock, hoping this service work will soon be brought to a close at Armageddon. No, they are determined to push the true worship to the uttermost parts of this island, thus to aid ‘the man with the writer’s Inklrorn’ to ‘place a mark upon the foreheads’ of the Newfoundland people that sigh and cry for the worldly abominations so visible to all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand have gone ahead, preaching the gospel for two years without the restraint of a government ban upon them. The brethren have not been hindered in their organizational work. They appreciate, too, the presence of Gilead graduates who have helped them in their field-service activity. Already the number of pioneers has increased and there are a few more company organizations. The people of good-will have associated themselves very definitely with God’s people. In 1946 there were 568 publishers on the average; 1947 brought 678, and a new peak was reached in August of 779. The work in New Zealand is expanding, all to the glory and honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1947 has been an outstanding year in the New Zealand field. First came the “Glad Nations” Assembly at Wellington, December, 1946, which for enthusiasm and attendance was by far the best convention enjoyed to that date. It was the first time since 1939 that all publishers had been able to meet together in one united assembly. So this season was one of unusual gladness as old friendships were renewed and new ones made. The Cleveland releases arrived by the last available ship, and an obliging carrier whisked them from the dock on the eve of holiday closing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before all the conventioners had returned to their home towns, the first Gilead graduate appointed to New Zealand arrived and quickly took his place within the framework of the local organization, serving the companies as servant to the brethren. This provision of the Lord has been a great blessing and has brought about an improvement in organization, more in keeping with headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next, in early March, we had the pleasure of a visit from the Society’s president, Brother Knorr, accompanied by his secretary, Brother Henschel. Such an unprecedented event was keenly appreciated by the brethren in this remote country, and we look forward to regular visits from the president, feeling that such are necessary to keep us in step with the Theocratic organization in its forward march. Furthermore, the personal contact with our brethren from headquarters enabled us to better appreciate the Theocratic setup. Our visitors, by their position as “servants of all”, emphasized the manner in which the Lord manifests his approved representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final feature of our most eventful year was the inauguration of the circuit assemblies. At the outset there were three circuits and, therefore, three assemblies were arranged to be held during August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From its introduction, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> caught the fancy of all and the subsequent subscription campaign skied our report figures to an unprecedented peak. In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaign alone, 33 percent more subscriptions were obtained than in the entire previous twelve months. Two enthusiastic publishers secured 16 subscriptions out of a possible 19 houses in one street. The later four-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ait'ake! </span><span class="font4">campaign also showed good results. The total of new subscriptions entered during the year was 6,012.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This second year clear of bans and restrictions has found the New Zealand public less sensitive to their former patriotic bias. The Labor government, by its social security legislation, takes care of the material needs of the people. Parents receive 10/- weekly for each child under 16 years of age, and a generous pension is paid to the aged and incapacitated. Additionally, free medical service and medicine are available to all. The keen overseas demand for New Zealand’s primary products has created an air of prosperity which lulls many into a sense of false security. These have no desire for Kingdom blessings, but others see the surface veneer covering the rottenness of the old world and express a desire to stand on the true and safe Rock.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this small country of volcanoes, revolutions and beautiful lakes you will also find a little group of very happy witnesses of Jehovah who are enthusiastically praising Jehovah’s name. It was only a few years ago that some graduates from Gilead were sent to Nicaragua, there to start the work of preaching the gospel and expanding the Kingdom message into that field. A good report is made this year by the Branch servant. It shows continual progress, even against adverse conditions. The joy of Jehovah’s people is again shown in this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has graciously led many sincere persons of good-will out of the world’s darkness and into the light and service of his organization during the past year. The blessings gained and enjoyed by his “other sheep” here far outweigh the difficulties they experienced in obtaining the truth. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saldn del Reino</span><span class="font4"> has come to be a landmark in the capital city and other places and is mentioned by everyone but the religionists and their “shepherds”, those that love darkness and show great anxiety at seeing former members of their congregations standing on a street corner with the magazines or working from door to door or even entering a public meeting with Jehovah’s witnesses. Two years of steady witnessing have pulled the cork from the religious bottle and courageous persons are fighting their way up and out into the free air that surrounds the Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first month of the service year saw 23 publishers zealously working in the field and preparing for Nicaragua’s first convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. Brethren returning from the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly in the United States brought stimulating Information to the local brethren about the world-wide expansion work and other blessings received at the assembly, and a notice that there would be two special representatives from the international convention to take part in the local program put even more enthusiasm into the preparation. Thousands of handbills and special letter-invitations were purchased and stacks of placards and window signs were held in readiness. At the beginning of the convention week Brother and Sister T. H. Sie-benlist arrived and advertising began in earnest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All religions here are generally agreed that there are really three gods instead of one, their only opposers being Jehovah’s witnesses. How the old mother of the doctrine hates to see her children learn of her lies! That hurts, but it is almost more than she can bear to see them out publishing the truth to their former associates. One of the brethren placed a Bible and a book in the door-to-door work with a young man. Calling back in a month, the young man told him that the family was radically Catholic and that his father was going to destroy the books, but that his sister had kept him from it. The family moved before the sister could be contacted. After the Kingdom Hall was established in the new location and a public meeting was being advertised, the girl was located in the same block as the hall and she was still holding on to her books, and was anxious to study. The family attended mass regularly and was especially devoted to a picture of Mary on the living-room wall. The girl went to mass in the morning and to the public meetings in the afternoon on Sundays. As the study progressed Mary disappeared from the wall, the mass was dropped, and every week for the last four months of the service year this wide-awake girl has regularly published the truth from door to door and in the magazine street work, meeting her many Catholic friends and endeavoring to awaken them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, some of those brought up in Catholic families never have been able to swallow religion’s farcical rituals and have had the fortitude to stand up against them because they were wrong. While advertising a public meeting a publisher contacted a woman that had acquired </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> a year before, had read it, but admitted that she did not understand it. A study was arranged and she began attending meetings. Her Catholic family and close friends had always looked upon her as a rebel because she had accepted the Bible as the truth and refused to believe that it was a sin to do so, as the “father” said it was. She had been the target of Protestants as well, but had remained free from organizational ties. Astounded at what she learned in the studies, she began using her Bible on her friends to convince them of the truth also, and read day and night to learn more. Door-to-door work was hard for her and street-corner work was harder, but she is now striving for GO hours a month and has definitely joined the ranks of those giving praise with their lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final month of the service year came and went quickly, but it proved to be the most blessed month of the entire year. A series of four public discourses was arranged and strenuously advertised by the company in Managua, bringing a record attendance to one of the city’s theaters. Several new brethren came to help, and the fourth new peak, of 65 publishers, plus an all-time high of hours made Nicaragua realize more than ever that the expansion program was in full force. Two more brethren were immersed at the end of the year and two others have filed applications to do their part in the full-time service during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to see that the message of the Kingdom is preached here. An outstanding thing in their report for the year is the number of public meetings they have had. They have pushed this work into every nook and corner of the land—the big cities, the small towns, the parks, outdoor meeting-places—and with good results. The people of Norway know of the Kingdom and know that Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to preach the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early part of the year there were certain obstacles that stood in the way of progress, but as the year moved along more people of good-will associated themselves with the organization until a new peak was reached in Norway, of 972 publishers. The brethren in Norway are making a good comeback after their difficulties of the war years. The Branch servant, whom we sent to Norway from the Brooklyn Bethel home, gives us the following report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had an average of 766 publishers, composed of men, women and children of all ages and all walks of life. These were scattered over this large land of Norway to the north, south, east and west. Many of our companies are small in number, often just one or two who are isolated somewhere in the country; but they are doing good service. What the brethren needed most was instruction and guidance, and this came to them with good effect through the servant to the brethren work. It was in December that this new feature was introduced into Norway. Four servants were appointed to serve the 78 companies that were organized into circuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were a number of conventions held during the year, but the one looked forward to with the keenest interest was the one held in Oslo where the American brethren, Brothers Knorr and Henschel, were able to serve on their world tour. Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway put forth every effort to attend this assembly, and were well rewarded. The travelers had just finished attending an assembly in Stockholm, Sweden, after which they journeyed to Oslo, arriving in time to serve that assembly well for two days. The public talk, “The Joy of All the People,” was attended by 1,446. However, Brother Knorr’s talk based on the 13th and 14th chapters of Romans, which was clearly and logically set forth, was the one thing of the convention that the brethren best remember. The Norwegian brethren no longer want to worry about little personal matters, and the practical illustrations given in the talk helped them to understand better the fact that the Kingdom interests must be sought first and that loving one another Is not just an expression but something that has to be actually lived. These thoughts were indelibly impressed upon our minds at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway have stressed particularly the public meeting work and have put forth a real effort In this regard. There are one or two experiences that are of outstanding interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the Oslo units had difficulty finding halls in their territory for the talks; so they bought a public-address system. This summer they went throughout their rural territory holding public lectures in the city and town parks. This has proved to be a very good way to hold lectures In the summer in this country, because most of the people spend their spare time in the open. At the different series held during the summer months attendance has been from 50 to over a hundred, with many more people in homes around the parks listening in through open windows or while sitting at leisure on their porches and doorsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This same company, having obtained permission from the park department to hold public talks in a park of a small town, had held one lecture. Placards had been set up around town advertising the second talk in the series. One publisher engaged in setting up these placards reported that all had been torn down the next day only to be replaced by a placard announcing a mass meeting of the townspeople to discuss some political grievance they had. An investigation was made with an effort to show the city fathers that they were in the wrong by not going to the park department to learn if the park was available for them. But no, “this is our town and our park; we can do as we like with it.” Not desiring to stir up trouble, Jehovah’s witnesses decided to postpone their meeting two hours so that the town could have their mass meeting. The faltering, hesitant town speaker behind a beer-case rostrum, talking over poorly-working speaking equipment, drew a mass of bored public of 80 persons. At its elose, the witnesses set up their speaking equipment, folding speakers’ stand of pleasing construction, and announced they were ready to begin (by playing a beautiful musical record), all in fifteen minutes’ time. The Theocratic-ministry-trained speaker held the interest of his audience of nearly 100 to the close of his talk. How true the words of wise counsel, ‘If it be of God you cannot stop it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another interesting experience was related in a town where a company had rented a hall for a series of four talks. Two had been held, with attendance of 40 and 45, when the hall manager phoned that his hall was no longer available to Jehovah’s witnesses. A public-address system was borrowed, a park across the street from the hall was obtained, and advertising went on as usual, with hand bills and literature from door to door, while the publishers explained what had happened. The attendance at the next meeting increased to over 100, with many more listening from their homes close by.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are 23 graduates of Gilead working in the Republic of Panama and among the people in the Canal Zone. The Branch office is in Panama city where a missionary home has been established. Other missionary homes are located in Colon and in the interior city of David. A marvelous work has been accomplished during the past year by these brethren along with the company publishers and other pioneers who are associated with them. Immediately after the “Glad Nations” Assembly at Cleveland, Ohio, Brother and Sister Siebenlist were sent through Central America, visiting the Branch offices and holding conventions. One of such assemblies was held in Panama, with good success. The assistance these two brethren gave to the publishers in Panama was greatly appreciated. Other helps to the work in Panama were the new books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font5"> which are being readily received by the Englishspeaking people. The report of the field-service work in Panama which was furnished by the Branch office is very interesting, and parts of it are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Starting off expansion early in the service year, the company in Panama city was divided into two units, Spanish and English. The previous year the combined peak of publishers was 63, and this year the Spanish Unit had a peak of 26 publishers, while the English Unit had a peak of 80, or a total of 106. Coldn, the second-largest company in the Republic, has also had an increase in publishers, from 35 last year to 61 this year. This increase is due largely to the work of the Gilead graduates in these two cities the past two years. The local brethren have co-operated splendidly in putting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> into effect both in their field service and in their company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Panamanians are very expressive both verbally and with gestures in showing their appreciation for the light of truth and freedom from the yoke of religion with its traditional mass and “purgatory” racket. A group of 8 to 14 of those who have come out of the Catholic church have recently begun to meet for a book study at the Branch missionary home in Panama city, where they love to exchange experiences they had in the church. One woman who had once been wealthy told of the death of her cousin and how, since their priest had often exhorted them to acts of charity, she asked that he donate his services in a mass for her cousin; but no, he could not do that, as he had too many relatives he had to support. She told him she was not asking for his money, only that he say mass, it would cost him nothing. Still he could not, as the bishop would see by the records that he had not reported cash received for his services and would report it to the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been no open opposition to the work except in Colon, where a priest tried to get the owner of a hall used for public meetings to deny us the use of it on the grounds that we are against the Catholics. The man refused, and told the priest that it looked to him as though the Catholics were against us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Street magazine work in Panama city and Colon is always interesting, as these two cities are located on the famous canal where one meets people from all over the world. Picture yourself on a very narrow sidewalk lined with hundreds of vendors with their easels displaying lottery tickets, and flanked by cantinas with juke boxes blaring full blast, and thousands of people milling back and forth looking for the “lucky” number among the lottery tickets, or on their way into or out of a cantina; and you have a picture of magazine work in Panama. Frequently you would hear a passer-by say, “Why, Jehovah’s witnesses are here too.” Never a dull moment I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One man handed a magazine publisher a dollar and asked that his subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> be renewed. The address given was in El Salvador. Another man wanted the subscription sent to his brother in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For some time we have desired to get some work started in the interior of Panama, which includes all of the Republic outside of the cities of Panama and Colon and the Canal Zone. David is the largest city in the Interior, and early in the service year five Gilead graduates were sent to this city to introduce the Kingdom message to these Spanishspeaking natives, many of whom, under Romish religion, have never seen a Bible. A missionary home was established and the work of expansion began in David and surrounding towns. Only one brother was conversant with Spanish, which is spoken exclusively in David; but, by the Lord’s grace, six months later all five were sufficiently well versed in Spanish to be able to conduct the first Spanish circuit assembly held in Panama, each taking an active part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much literature has been placed and a company organized in David. As many as forty persons have attended the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and service meetings held in the mis-slonary home; also, a series of public meetings has been held in the city’s finest school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much of the territory there consists of adobe houses and thatch-roofed bamboo huts called “bohios”, the majority of which are occupied by pigs and chickens as well as humans. It is nothing unusual to be greeted at the door by a fat, grunting pig tied by the neck to the leg of a bed or table inside, or to have the study Interrupted by the cackling of a hen that has laid its egg in an open dresser drawer or under some article of furniture in the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By working in these mountain villages, they have had opportunity to observe real primitive life. They have eaten their food prepared over open fires; slept in beds of canvas; fought mosquitoes, and side-stepped snakes. They have literally lived with these people and have come to know their habits and customs. They now know that their reason for putting a handkerchief between their lips before leaving public meetings is to avoid taking cold; and that they burn cow dung before their doors during a thunder storm to keep the lightning away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since receiving instructions to work the rurals, a special effort has been put forth in the Coldn area to do so; and the pioneers and company publishers have co-operated in getting this done. On Sunday morning a group of publishers charter a homemade bus called a “chlva”. The publishers are let off along the highway in pairs, to follow trails back through the bush, as the jungle is called, and seek out the “sheep”. Very good results have been obtained. A study has been started in one small settlement, which is attended by 20 to 25 persons who show much interest. Public meetings will be started there soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although there is much ignorance and superstition among the people throughout Panama, enthusiastic publishers hope, by the Lord’s grace, to in time extend the Kingdom message to the full limits of the republic.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This small semitropical country of vast forests and many rivers started the service year with four graduates from Gilead. During the year six more were sent into the country to carry on the expansion work. Paraguay has had the oppressive hand of the Catholic Church over it for centuries, but here again is another nation that must hear the truth, and God’s servants have gone forth to disciple the people of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good progress has been made during the year, and there is now an average of 34 publishers. With the clergy and the revolutions in the country they have had a difficult time, but Jehovah’s witnesses have pressed on faithfully in the expansion work. Some excerpts from the Branch servant’s report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the confessionals the clergy refused to give absolution to the mailmen If they did not stop delivering the Society’s magazines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to subscribers living in the capital, Asuncion. As a result, many of the Society’s magazine subscribers did not receive their copies. To overcome this move of the clergy to withhold the spiritual food the Lord has provided for his people here in Paraguay as elsewhere throughout the world, it became necessary for the missionaries to deliver the magazines to all subscribers living in the capital area, instead of having the city’s mailmen do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the latter part of March of this year (1947) a revolution broke out in Paraguay, which lasted for six months. Many of the people the brethren were calling upon for back-calls and book studies have fled the country, because they feared violence and imprisonment. Then, too, free movement was very much restricted in the capital by reason of the many soldier guards posted throughout the city. These conditions restricted the brethren from making back-calls and book studies upon those still remaining in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the greatest period of the revolution that was raging in the country, the capital’s transportation was nil. Due to the opposing, rebelling Paraguayan army which had the city blockaded, there was a gasoline shortage. Consequently there was no bus service to be had, and the city’s 18 dinky streetcars were crowded to capacity to care for the capital’s estimated 152,000 inhabitants. There were many days, too, when even this extremely poor service was not available to the populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the above it can be seen that the brethren, especially those residing in the capital, were obliged to overcome many obstacles the Devil put in the path of Kingdom progress here in Paraguay. Other difficulties that confronted the brethren are the regular four-hour siesta which is observed daily throughout Paraguay, the extreme religiousness of the people, and the scorching tropical heat of the country. All of these things proved rather trying at first to the missionaries who had recently arrived from the United States to seek for the Lord’s “other sheep” in Paraguay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, despite the difficulties, the past service year has been a blessed one for the brethren who had the wonderful privilege of serving the Great Theocrat, Jehovah, in this idolatrous land, and some progress has been made in advancing the Kingdom Interests.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The land area of the Philippines consists of 7,083 islands. However, scattered throughout this vast territory, there are only 7 cities with a population of 25,000 or more. Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is now reported to have a population of over 1,000,000 persons. There are now 178 companies organized which are being visited regularly by 10 servants to the brethren. There has been a splendid increase during the year. In 1946 there was an average of 1,033 publishers, while the 1947 service year had an average of 2,471, with a peak of 2,902. Considering the difficulties under which the Philippine brethren had to operate during the war, the Lord has certainly blessed them in gathering together the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new Branch servant was appointed during the year, a graduate from Gilead. The change was made because a better organization had to be established in the Branch office. The former Branch servant and his family still remain in the office because they have faithfully carried on their work. The report from the Philippines for the year is very interesting, and parts of it are herein set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">American rule of the Philippine Islands for over forty years has fostered a genuine love of liberty among the people here. It has encouraged widespread education, with the result that the Filipinos are among the most enlightened people of the Far East. This has resulted, too, in a widespread use of the English language. Last year the Philippines gained independence, but their form of government closely resembles that of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having tasted the educational advantages and freedoms of a democratic form of government, the people of the Philippines are, on the whole, very receptive to the message of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. Even those who have not had educational advantages are eager to learn and will take the time to discuss the Scriptures diligently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers of The Theocracy have been energetic and resourceful in keeping the Kingdom message ever before the people. In addition to the regularly arranged service activities, two outstanding assemblies were held in Manila. The first was the “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly, December 18-20, 1946. This was our echo of your grand international assembly at Cleveland, Ohio, in August of the same year. Upward of 5,000 heard the thrilling discourse on “The Prince of Peace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came the “Praise-giving Nations” Theocratic Assembly—from March 31 to April 2, 1947. This crowned the year with Jehovah’s goodness, because it was then that you were here, Brother Knorr, with your companion, Brother Henschel. The joy of the publishers was unrestrained. Clearcut counsel on organization and conduct in the field cleared away many puzzling questions in the minds of the publishers. Their vision of the Theocratic organization and its operation throughout the earth was enlarged. The proper use of our tongues was emphasized. Let them abound with the praise of Jehovah! If we do that there will be no time or occasion for finding fault with our brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By your presence you prepared the way for the graduates of Gilead School, who were to follow you. Three of these landed at Manila on June 14. Two of these are now in the servant to the brethren service and the other is in the office. Another landed on July 20 and is also serving as a servant to the brethren. These Gilead-trained servants to the brethren are a great assistance to the companies in better organizing for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the lack of dialect literature, the increase in the work here has been so rapid that it is necessary to look for new quarters for the Branch office. This presents a real problem, as so much property was damaged during the war. Manila was terribly wrecked. Its finest buildings are now in ruins. Real estate has mounted sky-high in value. However, we trust in Jehovah to direct us in the selection of quarters that will be both serviceable and becoming to the blessed work in which we are permitted to engage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tills report would be incomplete without the experiences of some of the Filipino servants to the brethren and pioneers. The servants to the brethren have shown commendable faith and courage in serving their brethren under hardships and dangers. The Hukbalahaps, an organization of Filipino night raiders, keep the countryside of central and northern Luzon In a state of terror. They raided many villages In the past months. They demand all the food and equipment they can carry away with them, and refusal means death or having one’s home burned to the ground. Last week-end we received a report from one of the servants to the brethren that the village of Mayantoc was burned to the ground by raiders who were after food and any other supplies they could get. The servants to the brethren in Luzon island are ever in danger of these lawless elements. They face many hardships in getting from one company to another and in working with the company publishers, many of whom are very poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their work has not been carried on without opposition from the religious “goats”. While visiting the company at San Marcelino, province of Zambales, a servant to the brethren gave a public discourse in the town plaza. The mayor had issued a permit to use the plaza and the bandstand. This happened to be located directly in front of the Roman Catholic Church buildings. Upward of 200 were in attendance, including the mayor, the chief of police and other municipal officials. Students from the parochial school lingered to hear the lecture. After the speaker had begun his address the church bells began to make a great noise, apparently to drown out his voice. The audience continued to give rapt attention to the brother. Soon a priest in his long robes was seen in the crowd trying to dissuade others from listening further. All to no avail. When excerpts from the works of Cardinal Newman were being cited and quoted in support of statements made in the talk, the priest cried out in a frenzy: “Stop 1 Stop!” At the same time he waved his arms and clapped his hands. However, the mayor proved to be a real man. He told the priest to cease disturbing an orderly meeting, as a permit had been issued to use the town plaza for that purpose. No amount of argument by the priest would sway him and the meeting went on to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the circuit assemblies starting out the new service year, we confidently look forward to a great increase. This is the time for expansion, and we know that Jehovah will be with us no matter what the problems we face.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Good advances have been made in Poland during the 1947 service year. The work in every respect has been better organized. This is due somewhat to the meeting of the Branch servant with the president of the Society when he made his trip through Europe this past year. The Branch servant’s report shows how the interest of the people of good-will continues to grow. For example, there were 18,150 persons who attended the Memorial service this year, to compare with 12,401 the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two graduates of Gilead are now working with the Branch office, and their knowledge of Theocratic instructions has been a real help to the Branch organization and to the brethren throughout Poland. Excerpts from the Branch servant’s report are very interesting and show what the brethren have to contend with in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The general situation in the country has improved considerably. While the work at the Branch was interrupted twice the previous service year because those at Bethel were arrested, this year we worked peacefully without disturbance. In some cases where the brethren were arrested in other territory, our personal intervention with the authorities caused them to be set free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I had an interesting conversation in this connection with a military prosecutor in the western part of the country concerning the arrest of three of our brethren, one of whom was a servant to the brethren. The brethren had been held for about a month. After presenting the whole matter to him and answering numerous questions, he seemed satisfied and immediately telephoned for the release of the brethren. He was very much interested in why our cobelievers do not want to serve in the army. After showing our position in reference to God’s law, he clearly understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the conversation, the assistant to the prosecutor came in and, after receiving an adequate witness, testified that he himself was in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp together with Jehovah’s witnesses and that they were fine examples and the most honorable people he had ever met in his life. It was indeed an extraordinary, sublime moment, to hear from the mouth of the assistant prosecutor such commendable words of acknowledgment and appraisal of our brethren who had been in the concentration camps. What wonderful fruits from the sufferings of our brethren during the second world war!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year the Lord’s people in general had the opportunity of continuing the work of praising Jehovah’s name, because many of the Catholic Action forest bands decreased in the country, due to the amnesty granted by the government. Many people who were deceived by the Roman clergy benefited by the amnesty and left the ranks of the Catholic Action bands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are persons who were previously leaders of such robbing bands, and who inflicted horrible injury upon the Lord’s people at the beck of the clergy, who are at present starting to become interested in the truth and who invite the brethren to their homes for discussions and ask how they might amend the harm they did to the people and our brethren while under the command of Catholicism. It is a great wonder what the truth will do in the hearts of the people if they will incline themselves to God’s truth. Although, before, they may have been comparable to rapacious animals, now, because of the effect of the Lord’s truth, they are like sheltered sheep who do harm to no one, but reversely, try to help others who are yet in darkness. Wonderful indeed is the educational work which Jehovah God is conducting at present in the earth by his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The general instructions of the Society have been a great blessing for the Lord’s people here, pointing out to them the plain road and course to Theocratic victory. Many of the more capable brethren did not return from the concentration camps, and because of this the situation in the beginning looked critical. The question was asked: In what way must we approach the work in order to meet the great task ahead of us? Then we were informed of the course in Theocratic ministry which was already in progress in many countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later, when we heard of the public meeting campaign, which was also in operation in many countries, we did not consider any difficulty exceptional to us in our country; so we equally proceeded with the same campaign. In the beginning it appeared to some of the brethren with good intentions that the public meeting campaign could not be conducted everywhere, but, after the company servants were encouraged and strengthened, they went forth to this work trusting in the Lord’s help and guidance, and the results were unexpectedly gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In connection with a convention, I must mention one characteristic occurrence at the main meeting where I showed the Lord’s people the task lying before us and our responsibility to the Polish people before Armageddon. At this time the convention chairman handed me a small slip with the information that two representatives of the Bishop’s Curia were present in the character of spies. This information filled my heart with great joy, and I also informed the Lord’s people assembled of the presence of these two representatives of the Hierarchy and pointed to where they were sitting. I then clearly explained why the Hierarchy hid the name of Jehovah before the eyes of the deceived people and yet continued to pray: “Hallowed be thy name!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When I showed those present God’s verdict which rests upon the whole Hierarchy and cited these representatives of the Hierarchy as before the judgment-throne of Jehovah God for the purpose of receiving their sentence, then the chief representative of the Bishop’s Curia fainted, and one of our sisters had to unfasten his collar, which was fastened in the back, and give him something to recover. When he regained consciousness again he slowly left our large hall before the finish of the talk, and the children of our brethren accompanied him peacefully to the street. This high clergy representative had the opportunity of seeing the good rearing of the children of our brethren who assisted him peacefully, politely and respectfully, not like the Catholic children who behave themselves like a pack of young wolves when our publishers work their villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great witness for the truth was our convention in Cracow, were 7,000 Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions gathered, and during the public lecture the number in attendance grew to 8,000 persons. In the river Vistula, which lies opposite the ancient king’s castle “Wawel”, 427 persons were baptized and confirmed their readiness to do the will of God. The convention was the largest one yet in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another great event for us was the government’s permission for the importation of 250,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind</span><span class="font4"> and 7,500 copies of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> These were the first publications of books and booklets we received from Brooklyn since 1938, and for this reason they caused great rejoicing and enthusiasm among the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A few letters have come from brethren in Portugal in recent years. During this past year it was possible to arrange to send two of the Society’s traveling representatives to Portugal to meet with the brethren and give them instruction. There are several groups of brethren in Portugal and they are doing what they can under conditions not so favorable for proclamation of the Kingdom message. There is one registered company in Portugal that is organized and doing good work. Interested persons throughout the country are in touch with this group of consecrated brethren and it appears that the Lord is blessing the gradual expansion of service in Portugal. Every possible form of assistance that the Society can provide will be given to the brethren in Portugal during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Ever since Russia took a portion of Polish territory, the Polish office has tried to look after the brethren who are living in Russian territory. It is usually a great chore for a servant to present an annual report on a country, but reporting on Russia this year grieves my heart The main difficulty in Russia is not so much with the Russian authorities as with the Catholic Hierarchy, which is trying desperately to crush Jehovah’s witnesses throughout all of Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report on hand covers only eight months, but this shows an average of 3,498 workers. Great persecution has been brought to bear against Jehovah’s witnesses because of their preaching of the gospel, because they attend the meetings and because they present the Bible or even leaflets to the people. Anyone who declares himself to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses gets into difficulty. Many have been brought into court and have had all of their possessions confiscated—their property, homes, cows, horses—and then they have been consigned to hard labor, usually for ten years somewhere in the center of Russia. For being a minister of the gospel they are punished in work camps. Words are not adequate to describe their grievous sufferings. Most of our brethren in Russia, however, are located in the western Ukraine which formerly belonged to Poland, many in Bessarabia, and some in central Russia ; but, no matter where they are, great persecution befalls them now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A petition was prepared by Brother Knorr and Brother Covington on behalf of the Russian brethren, and this was to be presented to the officials in the land, requesting them to give proper recognition to Jehovah’s witnesses because they are worshiping God in spirit and in truth and therefore should be recognized the same as any other religious society. Before this petition was ever presented to the government, the material was seized by authorities within Russia and confiscated. The brethren were brought into court, and a time for trial has been set. It is hoped that all the information in the petition can be brought out In the court, which we believe will be beneficial to our brethren, showing that they are not opposed to the state but that they want the liberty to preach the gospel. Other copies of this petition are being prepared, and it is hoped that eventually they will reach Moscow so that our case can be accurately presented before the government. Our brethren need relief, and everything is being done that can be done to aid them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is impossible to gather a full year’s report on Russian activity, because of severe censorship In and out of Russia, but we do rejoice with our brethren in the grand stand they are taking. Our hearts are eager with readiness to help our</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">brethren in Russia, but for the time being we cannot do anything but join in prayer, entreating the Lord to protect his people in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When one reflects and sees that just a year ago there were only 36 publishers in Puerto Rico, and that now there is an average of 87, one must conclude that expansion has taken place here. These good accomplishments can be attributed to the fine work of the Gilead missionaries who have gone into the territory. They have learned the Spanish language, and after some time have come to understand the people, even as the natives of Puerto Rico are understanding the missionaries. They see the vast difference between religion and true Christianity. Many are forsaking the Catholic organization and are now listening to the truth on the radio and at public meetings. The report of the Branch servant gives us a good picture of progress, and we find hopes for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year saw regular activity being carried on in just two cities on the northern coast of this little Caribbean island. Expansion took place during the 1947 service year and the proclamation work was extended to take in some fifteen different cities and towns throughout the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all ways it has been an eventful year. Our “Glad Nations” Theocratic Assembly came quickly in October and brought gladness and considerable Theocratic advancement. The talk “The Prince of Peace” w’as delivered in Spanish in the beautiful School of Tropical Medicine to an audience of two hundred. That morning eighteen new publishers had been immersed in the blue ocean waters of the Atlantic. Stimulated by the convention, the number of publishers in the island jumped from 58 in September to 71 in October. During the assembly we were happy to make contact with a brother from Cayey, a small town up in the mountains, and to learn, to our surprise, that he had been witnessing quite regularly by talking and placing literature in his barbershop. A month later the Branch servant began spending Sundays there working with him, and by March, when a public meeting campaign was put on, seven were ready to engage in the service. A newly enrolled pioneer brother was later assigned there and a small company formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio program, broadcast free over two stations, still continues to do a good work. Continually, persons are met in different parts of the island who state that they are already acquainted with the message, having heard the radio program. During a public meeting campaign in a town not far from San Juan a publisher was invited in by a smiling lady who said she was glad for the call, having heard the radio program for some time. After “sitting in” on the unseen Bible studies presented in the program she now longed for one in her own home and rejoiced when arrangements were made for one. Another person of good-will, blind, and an ex-radio man himself, first heard the message by radio. Later contacted by a Gilead graduate and studied with, he aided in arranging for a program to be broadcast over a third station, one of the two most powerful in the island. It should soon be carrying the Kingdom message to many persons not only in Puerto Kico but to most of the Islands in the Caribbean area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding feature of the work, however, has been that of the public meeting campaign. All told, 61 public meetings were put on this year, to compare with only 11 last year. Twelve different towns were witnessed to by means of these lecture series. The summer campaign in outlying towns proved to be a delightful arrangement bringing many benefits. Many newly interested persons, timid about witnessing in their home town, began to take part in the advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Practically the only real opposition manifested thus far has come from priests endeavoring to stop these public meetings. Only once have they been successful in gaining a cancellation of our use of the meeting-place. In one section of Santurce a series of eight lectures provoked the goatish religionists to go throughout the area with printed placards which they placed over the doors of many of the homes and which read “No se moleste—Somos Catolicos”, meaning “Don’t trouble yourself—We are Catholics”. One Gilead graduate, on her way to make a back-call on a young man who had attended some of the lectures, noted several of these signs on the houses. On arriving at the house of her back-call she saw that he too had a sign. But this one was different. Nicely made of wood and well printed, it read “Welcome to this house, All of Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back in October, 1946, when we heard of the arrangement whereby Brother Steelman would visit most of the companies In the Caribbean area, we wrote you that we hoped to reach a total of one hundred publishers in the island by the time of his arrival. In July notice came of his visit to begin the following month and, happily, in that same month (July), 102 publishers reported. The last week in August he began visiting the companies in Puerto Rico and with this additional aid a new peak of 119 publishers was reached as a fitting climax to the 1947 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We gladly submit this year’s report, happy that it is one telling of expansion and progress and that it can be added to that of scores of others to testify that multitudes now respond when the call is given, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” And praise Him we shall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The past service year has been by far the best ever enjoyed by Jehovah’s witnesses in Rumania. This, in spite of serious and increasing difficulties. The clergy of Rumania have done everything within their power to stop the progress of the Lord’s work. They hate Jehovah’s witnesses and are using strong-arm squads and government agencies if they can to bring about the stoppage of the proclamation of the Kingdom message. In spite of this opposition which is very apparent to everyone who is seeking after truth and righteousness, the work in Rumania goes grandly on. The report of the Branch servant is very interesting. It is impossible to publish all of his lengthy report, but excerpts from it will give the reader some idea of what is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of companies has considerably increased in the course of the year, namely, from 278 to 389. This shows that the “other sheep” hear the Lord’s voice and are being gathered into his fold. Recently in a small town in eastern Rumania there was a public lecture which was attended by 150 persons. After the lecture 50 of these handed in their addresses desiring to be visited by Jehovah’s witnesses in order to learn more about God’s truth and kingdom. There are at present more people of good-will coming to a knowledge of the truth than ever before. The brethren are systematically working the territory. They shun no effort in carrying the truth from village to village and from town to town. It happens that they walk barefoot up to 60 miles in order to advertise the public lecture in a place where there are no witnesses yet or but a very few. Experience has taught them that if they undertake to advertise and hold a public lecture when there are only two or three, the clergy often succeed in intimidating their parishioners to such an extent that they do not attend, but when such parishioners see other people attending the lectures then they go too. Therefore the brethren help each other as mentioned above; they do not mind walking barefoot 20, 40 and up to 60 miles in order to help advertise a public lecture. This means that they leave about midnight and arrive in the evening of the same day at their destination. The second day is then used in advertising the lecture and distributing the literature; when the lecture is over they start again on their journey home. Some of them use a horse and cart, but most travel on foot. Of course, they cannot do this every week-end, but they can do it once in a while; and so they are giving sometimes two or three or even four lectures on the same Sunday, each lecture being delivered by another speaker and lasting about 45 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Rumanian Orthodox clergy, the same as the Roman Catholic clergy, always support the power of the day. During the war it was Hitler and Antonescu against Russia; now they show their complete willingness to take the side of those whom they fought against during the war. And if tomorrow there should be a new regime, then they would quickly swerve over to that side if it suited their purposes and interests. They have never acted in accordance with Jesus’ words, ‘Ye cannot serve two masters’; no, they are ready to serve another master every day, thus showing that they have never been the servants of Almighty God, but servants of the “prince of this world”. And the end of the Devil’s world will also be their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An outstanding event of the past service year was the convention held on September 28 and 29, 1946, at Bucharest On the first day 3,400 brethren attended it from all parts of the country, representing many different nations, and at the public meeting Sunday afternoon, which took place in the Roman Arena, we had 15,000 in attendance. In connection with this convention, the Rumanian State Railways had agreed to place at our disposal a special train, but a train of a kind that would hardly be used for this purpose In any other country on earth. It was comprised of 43 goods trucks such as are used for transporting cattle and other commodities, but Jehovah’s witnesses who traveled in these vans were just as happy and joyful as though they had been traveling in an American first-class Pullman. To them it was the first national convention ever held in Rumania, and therefore it was a unique experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From all the experiences we have had in Rumania since God’s truth is being proclaimed in this land, we knew that the clergy would try their utmost to strike a deathblow at this convention, but Jehovah’s power through his reigning King was manifest from the very beginning of this assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first one to start the storm of applause at the conclusion of the first discourse was the chief of the state police himself, who was there with a large number of gendarmes, and many of these followed their leader in approving what they had heard. The police were cognizant of the purpose for which they had come there, and so they were very much surprised themselves at this unexpected turn of events. Some of them stated to the brethren that their commission had undergone a change within the very first hour of this assembly, a change for the better for Jehovah’s witnesses, a change in the right direction. The clergy gnashed their teeth in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s spirit, his invisible active force, was operative in a still further capacity among his assembled people. During the war years some difficulties had arisen between some of the brethren in Rumania, and a number of them had come to this assembly with mixed feelings. But Jehovah showered down such bountiful blessings upon his consecrated people that all were swept along by the tide of this manifest blessing and thereby the Lord himself brought about greater unity, peace and harmony among his people in Rumania, which made our hearts glad. This has had lasting effects, and ever since we have had a better spiritual condition among the brethren in our land</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also deeply appreciated that the brother from Berne, and who was able to visit us as your representative, spoke to us on the very things that you, Brother Knorr, as well as Brothers Franz and Covington, dealt with at the Zurich convention. Thus It was as though you were speaking to us, and we are very grateful to the Lord for all these serious but kind and Scriptural exhortations that were conveyed to us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has a Branch office in Cape Town in the Union of South Africa, and this office directs the work in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nya-saland, Portuguese East Africa, St. Helena and Tanganyika, as well as looking after the interests of the Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. Depots have been established in certain of these countries, and reports of the work are sent in to the Union of South Africa. A wonderful increase has taken place in the work in South Africa during the past year. There are 2,400 more publishers who are now serving the interests of the Kingdom than formerly. All together 974 companies have been organized in this vast territory. This year a peak of publishers was reached of 20,003, to compare with last year’s peak, which was 16,128.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is probably no other country just like South Africa. It has its modern cities, while not too far distant there are primitive kraals of straw-and-mud huts, with vast areas of open veld and forests in which all manner of wild game roams. The thousands of publishers in South Africa have traveled through this great territory devoting 5,155,000 hours to the field service, preaching the gospel of the Kingdom to the white and colored alike. The Branch servant’s report on the different countries gives a very interesting view of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In October we had our Cleveland Extension Assembly at Johannesburg. This was the first national convention for several years, and the first six-day convention ever held in South Africa. When we planned it we had hoped that you might be with us; but, as this could not be, we made good use of the Cleveland material and crowded as much as we could of the 8-day program into the six days at our disposal. In all, some 800 European brethren and 2,500 African brethren were present, from all parts of the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new circuit arrangement came into operation in February and the Union was divided into 14 circuits. A Gilead graduate of the fifth class has been serving as district servant, and his ministry has been appreciated. Jehovah’s blessing has rested on the circuit assemblies, and the publishers have made a good effort to support them. In Zululand some of the African publishers walked 78 miles to the assembly point and 78 miles home again. They were 5 days on the road both coming and going. The zeal of many of these friends is really remarkable and it does one’s heart good to see their eagerness to learn and take to heart the instruction received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At some of the African public meetings the interest has been quite exceptional. An African servant to the brethren who had been sent to organize a new company gave a public lecture on August 17. The attendance was 173, nearly all new interest. He writes: “At the end there was a big rush for Sesuto publications. I had only 36 volumes, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lira (Enemies).</span><span class="font4"> They quickly went and the people wanted more. After the lecture those present went away to invite others to come to hear the truth. At 3 p.m. I had to deliver a second public lecture. At 5 p.m. another large group came to the hall and earnestly asked me to repeat the talk as they had heard from the 3 o’clock group that the truth was being spoken In that hall. So from 6 to 7 p.m. I gave the talk for the third time that afternoon. Brethren, there is certainly a great work to be done in this town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past service year seven brethren from this country had the great privilege of receiving Gilead training with the eighth class. All of them benefited greatly by the experience and instruction received, and now, better equipped, they find joy in sharing once again in Kingdom activity in this part of the earth. It is hoped that they are but the advance guard of many more, both European and African, who will yet enjoy all the advantages to be derived from a course at that institution of highest learning.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The most conspicuous incident that marked the almost instantaneous move forward of the work was at Mumbwa. Here, for years there had been a government official in charge who had, by every means possible, hampered the witness work; imprisoned the publishers; broken down the Biblestudy shelters; broken up the Bible-study meetings, and generally done the work of his father well. But he had been warned in a letter that ill treatment of a people in their worship would be his undoing; and Jehovah was true to his word. The magistrate was fined for illegal conduct and made the subject of much official adverse and public comment, and he was replaced by another whose attitude was fair and just and in the highest tradition of British administration. The depot servant visited the district almost immediately and there met, by arrangement, all the chiefs and counselors at their quarterly meeting. The district commissioner, who had seen the huge study meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses at an assembly for two days prior to the arrival of the chiefs, said to them: “Has your opposition to these people stopped them?” And the chiefs wagged their heads and admitted that it had not. “Has it done any good?” No, it had not. “Suppose,” said the district commissioner, “that instead of persecuting and punishing these people you try to help them, and today hear their representative to see what he can do to assist you get over your own real and legitimate difficulties with those of Jehovah’s witnesses who have acted wrongly toward you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A meeting that had commenced with angry resentment against Jehovah’s witnesses ended in a victory for the Lord, and for an hour our work was patiently explained to a packed courtroom. Effectual control, impossible with the previous magistrate, was readily promised, and in response permission was granted for the erection of study centers throughout the district. That night, two chiefs came to the camp where the assembly was being held and said that with the old official gone there would be no more trouble; and today, twelve months later, the whole of the district is spread over with little grass or stronger shelters and the headmen are to be seen attending regularly. Fourteen of them had come to tell the chiefs of their devotion to the Lord’s organization at their big indaba; today that number could be multiplied many times. The European missionary near by has been so impressed by the zeal and conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses that he is reading some of our Kingdom literature, and. much to the chagrin of some of his mission folk, and in spite of protests, he visits the local company servant and encourages with his own people freedom for our message, and witnessing for his own church members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the above is no isolated case. When the European minister of the London Missionary Society arranged to hold a large morning service at one of his churches in the Ka-wambwa district he left his home early and on his way to the church he saw great numbers of people on the road hurrying the same way with Bibles in their hands. He was naturally pleased and hoped for a crowded church; when he got there he found a woman and a child. He went out and began walking around the church waiting for the people he had left behind on the road to arrive, but for an hour he waited fruitlessly. He made inquiries as to who were the people he had seen on the road coming in his direction, and was informed that they were Jehovah’s witnesses going to their witness work and study. At the afternoon service he openly admitted the excellence of the example they had shown and expressed his admiration for their zeal in the proclamation of their message. Whole villages have turned to the truth, and the established missions, except for their school and medical work, are losing ground. The Lord is with his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The government of this country continues to obstruct the importation of Kingdom literature. Representations made by the Society to the Colonial Office in London during the year, calling attention to the unjust treatment received, had some effect. The governors of the four British territories that go to make up the East African bloc (Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Kenya and Tanganyika) have been called upon by the Colonial Office to make a joint recommendation concerning the Watchtower Society and Jehovah’s witnesses. In making such recommendation they have been requested to keep two things primarily in mind, namely, (1) the principle of freedom of worship for all, including Jehovah’s witnesses, and (2) that prohibitions similar to those now existing in these lands have been withdrawn in every other part of the Empire. The good record of Jehovah’s witnesses in these lands during recent years should have been sufficient to prompt an Immediate removal of all restrictions, but, instead of taking such just action, the recommendation is withheld pending an examination of all the Society’s literature! We have protested against this procedure; for the literature was examined before the bans took place. We are now awaiting a reply to our latest protest. Meanwhile the public meeting campaign is being pushed to the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back-calling and public meetings bring forth good results and cause the supporters of religion no end of worry. Desperate and strenuous efforts are made by the clergy and their church elders to cldse the doors and the ears of the people to Jehovah’s witnesses both in the back-call work and in the public meeting campaigns that are doing so much to help the people to see, and to shatter Into so many pieces too, religion’s lies. A typical example of what often occurs may be of interest here to relate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The usual vigorous advertising by word of mouth and by notices pinned up on trees in the villages brought to the meeting place some 300 persons. It was an open-air meeting held next to the main village-road under some of the many shady mango trees that pattern the countryside. As the songs began still more people dropped along to listen, and eventually the talk began. About halfway through, lo, along the road conies the local clergyman pushing his cycle. Unfortunately for him he happened to be passing just as Micah 3:11 was being read out and promptly concluded that the speaker was referring to him personally. This so offended him that he reported to the village headman that Jehovah’s witnesses are ‘telling the people that I am robbing them of their money’; and that they must not be allowed to hold any more public meetings in the villages. The village headman called in the brethren, who explained the whole matter clearly and asked that the clergyman be called in as well to hear the full story. But no, the headman was not having any. As a matter of fact he went so far as to rule that Jehovah’s witnesses stop holding public meetings and that they confine their studies to their own homes. This ruling Jehovah’s witnesses, of course, could not accept, so they took the matter to the next-highest native court, where the chief reversed all that the headman had ever said and added a rider that anyone from now on found troubling Jehovah’s witnesses would be fined £5. That squashed all would-be Nimrod-minded folk and, by the time everything was finally ironed out, some 50 interested persons had taken their stand as active publishers of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are all looking forward to the time when the literature will once again be available for distribution, knowing that when that time does come it will be one of great rejoicing and will take the country as a flood of waters. For the people have not forgotten the petition, and often ask “What has happened to the books?” Yes, there are many friends in this compact little country of the Nyasa, and many of them, too, will come out to join the present happy throng singing the praises of the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the midst of an Ignorant, down-trodden race of people there is to be found an ever-increasing company of torchbearers of Kingdom light assisted and led by two pioneers who, with the Theocrat’s blessing, have been instrumental in locating many people of good-will and of righteous-minded disposition and in instructing them In Theocratic learning and service requirements. These brethren have traveled the paths of the forests bordering the banks of the crocodile-infested Zambezi river, enduring much bodily discomfort and hardship in order to take the glad tidings to the villages strung in continuous lines along its banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In their activities the pioneers once again met up with the officer who, last year, ordered that they be beaten. Upon meeting up with them for the second time, he said: &quot;Do you not know that I recognize you?” “Yes,” replied the one brother. “You arrested us and threw us into gaol to be beaten.” After they looked at him somewhat intently, the officer (who was accustomed to having others servile before him) must have been Impressed at their calm fearlessness, and said, ‘AU right, carry on with your work of preaching. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">do not want to stop you.’ These pioneers, too, always seem to be “just escaping” being collected and sent off to the labor camps where a new railway line is being pushed along. When labor is In short supply the people simply have no choice that they can call their own. Government trucks are sent round to the villages, and any male found either on the road or in his village is picked up and that is the last his family sees of him for the next twelve months. As a result many people flee into the bush when they get warning of such movements. And, of course, at times they mistake the harmless light-bearers of The Theocracy to be government </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kapitaos</span><span class="font4"> sent to round them up for labor. So it is that our brethren have to hunt them out in the bush in quite literal fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prophecy of ‘hunting them out from every mountain, and from every hili’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The seventeen publishers on St. Helena sent regular reports to the Cape Town office covering the first four months of the present service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">To facilitate the prompt handling of orders a depot was opened in Southern Rhodesia July 1. This forward step has been a source of encouragement to expansion-minded publishers in that land. There is a real need for three or four Gilead graduates to help out in Southern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lifting of the ban on our publications about the end of last service year, imposed at the outbreak of the World War, brought much joy to the Lord’s people in Southern Rhodesia. Preparations to make use of the literature in expanding Theocratic activity were immediately undertaken. There was no difficulty in getting supplies into our country. Having in mind, however, that for nearly seven years the house-to-house witnessing had been done mainly by word of mouth with the Bible in hand always ready to “prove all things”, it is easily appreciated that organized methods of preaching the gospel message with our literature were not well understood by most of the companies in the country. Servants to the brethren, under the old system of visiting the groups, did much good work in assisting the publishers to preach and teach, but they could not take the place of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, Organization Instructions, The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and other instructive publications issued by the Society. The lifting of the restrictions did not overcome the difficulty of putting the companies on an organized basis; rather it had only just begun. Getting study material to the witnesses was relatively a simple matter, but to help the African brethren to understand what is written in a language other than their own is a real problem, especially as the majority of Africans are practically illiterate.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Following World War I Britain was given a mandate over this former German colony. There are some 10,000 Europeans and six million Africans in a territory covering 360,000 square miles. The natives of the land are divided Into 85 tribes, grouped under nine classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work done during the year has been done by African witnesses, of whom there are now 200 spread over eight companies. Religious organizations are strongly represented and the brethren have encountered considerable opposition. They have pushed ahead, however, and the Lord has prospered their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Closer supervision within the territory and literature in Swahili are essentials if the expansion work is to go forward to the best advantage and for the proper feeding of the Lord’s “other sheep” in that land. We pray the Lord of the harvest to make the necessary provision in due time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country is still in a difficult situation in the world. Economic conditions are not good and the common people suffer want of many necessities of life. The people need the comfort that comes only from an accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. During the past year an effort was made to contribute toward the expansion of the proclamation of the good news in Spain. Two of the Society’s representatives made a brief visit to the Iberian Peninsula. It was possible to arrange for the forming of four company organizations in Spain. Instruction and suggestions were given to the Spanish brethren and they have now begun to study regularly and give the verbal witness in the near-by communities. Literature for study is very limited; but it is good to briefly report here that there has been some advance in Theocratic activity in Spain during the past year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Good progress has been made in this possession of the Netherlands during the past year. The people of Surinam desire freedom, as do all people of the world, but all they have is hollow promises. Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing many people in that land comfort through the Word of God. More missionaries were sent there during the year. A fine company has been organized in Paramaribo, and here again we have people who are being made glad with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year some work was started in French Guiana, and the Branch in Surinam has been looking after this interest. The servant includes the report of this country in with the Surinam report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom news has gone to the remote places of the land. Even the Djukas have heard about the established Kingdom. Djukas are the descendants of the runaway slaves who now live in the jungles. Their religion is idol worship which their ancestors brought from Africa. A brother who speaks the Djuka language has been giving public lectures in a soldier barracks where the Djukas assemble when they come to Paramaribo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In October four Gilead graduates arrived to aid the already publishing brethren. Since their arrival the gospelpreaching has increased and progressed. New ones have come to the knowledge of the truth; older ones who had long ago heard of the truth became more active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November, Brother Steelman visited Surinam for the first time. What joys and privileges were extended to the brethren I He first served the Paramaribo company. He went to each person of good-will and each publisher and requested them to join in the work. A public lecture was advertised, “The Prince of Peace,” with more than 150 attending the lecture. Later he went to serve the Nieuw Nickerie company and the same talk was advertised, with 115 attending. The servant to the brethren visit was a provision of Jehovah which arrived at just the right time. The brethren hope that such a visit will be repeated in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly was held in December. Handbills and placards for stores as well as personal Invitation were the means of advertising. This was the first time that street magazine work was done in Paramaribo. The people flocked around the publishers to know the meaning of this strange work; and 103 magazines were placed by the publishers in less than one hour. The public meeting “Fearless Against World Conspiracy” had an attendance of 213.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>FRENCH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work has expanded to French Guiana. Two brethren went to French Guiana in January. While contacting the people in St. Laurent the brethren were told ‘there is a man farther up the river who speaks just like you’. The brethren hired a car to seek this man, and, sure enough, there they found a man who had come from Guadeloupe and he was giving public lectures. He hadn’t any literature; but he was not quiet about the Kingdom. His greatest foe was the priest, who was busy warning the people not to listen to what this “crazy man” has to say. When the brethren returned to Paramaribo, they brought the French brother along. In Paramaribo he learned how the studies were being conducted and the progress of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In April the French brother together with a Surinamer returned to St. Laurent with a large supply of literature. Now one pioneer brother Is still preaching the gospel In Cayenne. In one month he reported 18 back-call book studies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the years of war the nation of Sweden was in a very prosperous condition. Today a certain amount of depression has hit the country, and various restrictions are placed upon the people because of the financial condition of the country. While Sweden is still a very prosperous country and one of the most blessed as far as this world’s goods are concerned, still the people are beginning to feel a decline. This condition has been advantageous to the Lord’s people, because it has softened the hearts and minds of the people, and they are hearkening to the word of the Lord. Until now they have been more or less haughty and high-minded, but many persons are now beginning to see that even Sweden can feel the effects of war and that war does not bring prosperity, but sorrow, grief, and continued selfishness. The brethren have done very well during the year in their field service, and the Branch servant sets out an interesting report on their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the service year 1947 had just begun there was “a call going out througli the length of the land”, Inviting Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions to gather together in convention. That was the Glad Nations Assembly which was going to be duplicated here, according to the directions of the Society. There had been no general assembly since the beginning of World War II, and hence all the friends made eager preparations to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After that convention we were confidently expecting a new peak of publishers pretty soon; and we would probably have gotten it, had it not been for the heavy epidemic of flu that swept the country for more than three months. It started in some parts early in December and culminated in February, when its ravages even caused the streetcar service in this town to become greatly restricted because of lack of employees to man the cars. During that month we reached a bottom figure for publishers, 2,545. But by April we had regained strength and even managed a new peak of 3,092. That was the first time that we passed the 3,000 mark. And since then we have kept above it, except for the great vacation month of July; but in August the reports showed 3,073 publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason for the peak in April was, of course, the special arrangements in connection with the Memorial, which were much appreciated. At the Memorial celebration 4.700 gathered together, and, of these, 384 partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reason for the increase in number of publishers in later months, and especially for their being more back-call- and book-study-minded, is the new circuit arrangement, which was introduced here in the middle of February. When starting out in the circuits some of the servants to the brethren were a bit nervous as to how the friends would react to the servant’s staying with them for a whole week, in view of the rationing and other difficulties due to postwar conditions, not the least among these being the housing difficulties and lack of space in most homes where families of several persons have to crowd into one or two rooms. But all their fears were dispelled by the hearty welcome received, and in some cases the brethren have said that one week is far too short a visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The model service meeting and Theocratic school on the first night of the assembly is one treat that is highly appreciated because of the Impulses there given for the home front where, due to lack of competent brethren, these meetings have often tended to become dull or lifeless. In connection with the school it is worth mentioning that, although the Swedes are generally slow of speech and backward in expressing themselves before an audience, there has been some really good progress made. One company servant reports about a young boy of ten who greatly surprised the older ones: “A boy of ten years gave a &amp;-minute talk a fortnight ago on the subject of ‘Paradise’ which was really very good. It is a pity that we may not count on him for a public speaker for several years yet!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That age in itself is no hindrance in the service is shown also in the case of one sister, of whom it was reported in the local daily that she was out with our magazines in the street work during the week when she reached 100 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One line of witnessing that lay idle during the war when harbors were closed to people in general has now been resurrected, viz., visiting the ships calling in the harbors. In some of these quite a number of books have been placed with foreign-speaking sailors, and also among Swedish sailors many good testimonies have been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many proofs that the religious leaders are getting more and more envious of the zeal and energy displayed by Jehovah’s witnesses. The magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Church and Home</span><span class="font4"> wrote to all of their subscription canvassers: “Especially in the towns and villages you will please try all ways and means possible in order to make your canvassing effective. We need more of the spirit of ‘up-and-at-them’ and of persistence that is animating Jehovah’s witnesses.” Another church paper made the following significant statement: “How is it that Jehovah’s witnesses have been able to get such a following? Must it not be because the Church has been keeping quiet about all that which is actually stated in Holy Writ regarding the return of Christ and what is then going to take place? We have been ashamed of It; we have not believed it, to tell the simple truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those young brethren who are reaching military age are being called up, according to conscription law, as usual, and those who refuse to serve are being sentenced to prison terms. In some cases the brother has just got out of prison when they meet him with a new order to report for enlistment, and so It goes on and on, the sentence becomes higher every time. There are, on the other hand, officials who have changed their attitude altogether. In one case even the prosecutor himself, after having listened to the brother’s defense, turned right about and started to defend him instead of prosecuting, stating that the boy was honest and wholehearted, and suggesting that there is no war now. The court-martial tried to get the boy out of trouble by ordering him to be mentally examined, but the doctors regretted after their investigation that they could not declare him off his mind, and so he had to be sentenced. He got the smallest penalty, however, that has ever been given any of our brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this report, just as it was at that marriage feast at Cana in Galilee, “the best wine” will be set forth last. And thus the unique thing happens that the annual report opens with tile record of a big convention and concludes with one of a still bigger and better convention, both held within the same service year. For twenty-two years we had not had the privilege of having a convention with the president of the Society, and hence, when Brother Knorr made arrangements to visit Sweden in connection with his around-the-world tour, this news was received with great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During his visit Brother Knorr gave much helpful instruction and advice regarding the organization of the work and conditions at the Branch, and we all felt greatly refreshed and built up by his presence with us, only regretting that the time was so limited.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witnesses of Jehovah in Switzerland have had many problems to overcome. One of the biggest was that of freedom of worship. By the Lord’s grace, the publishers today are going forward as the true ministers of God, taking a stand definitely for the Kingdom and declaring themselves to be ministers of the Most High. It is at Berne, Switzerland, that the Society operates its own printing plant, and during the year much literature was printed here, not only for Switzerland, but also for many European countries where literature was needed. The report of the Branch servant is very interesting, and excerpts from this report are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this service year we had two general assemblies, both in the beautiful Convention Hall of the Zurich House of Arts. The first convention (from the 14th to 16th of September, 1946) was a reflection of the grand Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly in Cleveland and the second (from 23rd to 26th of May, 1947) was made outstanding by the presence of the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, and several of his closest coworkers, Brothers Franz, Covington and Henschel. This was the first convention in Switzerland since the year 1936 to be favored by the personal assistance of the president. It can therefore be well understood that the brethren looked forward to this assembly of the Lord’s people with particular expectation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the discourses of. the brethren from Brooklyn were followed with rapt attention by the nearly 3,000 convention attenders. The high-light of the convention, however, was the heart-to-heart speech delivered by Brother Knorr Sunday afternoon. As a good father counsels his children so, kindly yet in unmistakable terms, he laid before the brethren assembled the things which had not been done in complete harmony with the Lord’s work and which needed correction. Relieved and with gratitude the brethren received the announced new line of action and magnified Jehovah for his gracious and loving leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr dealt mainly with the question of our office as ministers of the gospel and our absolute neutral attitude toward this old, unrighteous world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the convention Brother Knorr spent several days with Brother Henschel in the office in Berne, where he gave us much counsel and many good suggestions as to how the work might be done more efficiently and with less personnel in order that further coworkers might be made free for the pioneer service or to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the convention the number of circuits was increased to five and the number of servants to the brethren likewise was increased from two to five. After fourteen days of instruction in the new working method the five servants to the brethren left for their respective territories and, traveling from company to company, introduced the brethren into the new way of handling the “sword of the spirit”. From all sides enthusiastic echoes reached us. We have every reason to hope that an improvement may be expected in every avenue of the Kingdom service, especially in increase in number of publishers. From the tabulation of the service year 1947 it can be seen that the monthly average of publishers has risen from 1,469, in the former year, to 1,512, namely, by 43 publishers. The first two circuit assemblies, which were already arranged in March, 1947, were most enthusiastically supported, and these, without doubt, have contributed favorably toward this end, and we are certain that these circuit assemblies will be still more invigorating and instructive in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A small company located in the mountains reported a very happy experience. It was the first time that the public lecture campaign had been started with a powerful witness on the streets. This was something quite novel for these mountain villagers. Many observed with great interest the witness activity, took the magazines and inquired regarding the alms and purposes of our work. During the course of this campaign five persons of good-will joined this company and participated in carrying this glad message from house to house for the first time. Outstanding among them is a young boy who is hard of hearing, but who with surprising rapidity expressed the desire to be allowed to accompany one of the publishers into the service. At the doors he watched attentively the lips of the witness of Jehovah in order to carefully follow what he said. It was not long before he decided to go alone although he was almost deaf and “slow” of speech. Imagine the amazement of the publisher as he watched the boy at a few doors and heard the simple and clearly spoken words coming from a full heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In her service from house to house on the occasion of a circuit assembly in a smaller town with a predominant Catholic population, a sister came to the office of the cantonal police. She was able to give a good witness to the police officer on duty there. He listened gladly to the message and then accepted a booklet and magazine. Then he gave the sister various addresses asking her to visit these people that they too might learn of this grand message. Only a few years ago we sometimes had much opposition by the police in our preaching work in this town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, the Lord’s people in Switzerland joyfully took the opportunity of demonstrating in a material way their love toward their oppressed fellow publishers abroad. And they abundantly experienced the truth of the words of Solomon when he said: “The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The relief campaign of 1946-47 comprises 444 cases of clothing and household articles with a net weight of 24,504 kilograms (54,000 pounds) and a gross weight of 32,362 kg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The help of the brethren and friends of this small country of Switzerland both in a spiritual (Bible enlightening literature) and material way since the end of the war when reckoned in money value amounts to 262,904 Swiss francs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark216"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Splendid advance has been made in this country of South America. A number of years ago there were very few publishers in the land, but, due to the arrangement of the Society whereby a large number of graduates from Gilead were sent to Uruguay, there to open up missionary homes, marvelous progress has resulted. The report speaks for itself. Even though most of the people of Uruguay profess to be Catholic, not too much attention is paid to their religion, and the principle of freedom of worship is upheld by the government. The report of the Branch servant is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The past service year has been one of great rejoicing on the part of the Lord’s people in this smallest of South American republics. We have had the privilege of seeing the average number of publishers for the year almost double, going from 91 to 175.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly of four days patterned after the assembly in Cleveland was held October 17 to 20. It was by far the best assembly to that time we have had here. There were representative brethren from all over the country. Our assembly resulted in bringing the unspeakable spiritual blessings to the brethren here even as they are enjoyed by Jehovah’s people in other parts of the earth. We had just recently received the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World</span><span class="font4"> book and the Spanish concordance, both of which were released at the assembly and received with real enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had 35,000 handbills printed to advertise the public talk “The Prince of Peace”, to be given in the Ateneo de Montevideo on the 20th. By Thursday night we saw this would not be enough, and so ordered 15,000 more. The talk was advertised in all ways possible, including placards and announcements on the radio. The result was that 450 turned out to hear the talk. The assembly was refreshing, put us in tune with the expansion keynote for the rest of the service year, and, by the Lord’s favor, expansion has been the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In January we had our first circuit assembly in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants, Santa Lucia. This and another town about five miles away, Canelones, of about 20,000 inhabitants, were worked twice during the assembly, once on Saturday and again on Sunday. The leader of the anticlerical political party now in power called the “Batallistas” was glad to grant us the use of their hall for all of the meetings free of charge. This person is the local doctor and is very well liked in the neighborhood and is very antireligious. Quite a number of people were puzzled at the fact that he loaned us the hall for Bible lectures, thinking, of course, that we were religious. This gave the opportunity to give a good witness on several occasions. Twenty-one persons symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a great increase in public meeting activity in Uruguay in the last year, the total for this year being 90 to compare with 21 the year before. Many of these meetings were held in the homes of the people of good-will in the different sections of the city and also in the Kingdom Halls and some in the public squares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special publishers and the Gilead brethren have been the greatest single asset to the advancement of the field service and to help so many of the Uruguayans to become regular publishers of the Kingdom. Some of these have ten and more publishers they take out in the service with them regularly every week. The very presence of the Gilead brethren makes the Uruguayans feel international and seems to be an influence that causes the spirit of the Lord to have free play among the brethren. Many times it is the privilege of these brethren as well as that of some of the Uruguayan brethren to witness the destruction of images.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two missionary homes here in Montevideo besides the Branch home, which cares also for some missionaries. Such homes were established according to the president’s instructions the first of October, 1946. They are run in the most efficient and economical manner possible with the emphasis on the missionaries’ being free for the service in the field and association with the native publishers and people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We wish to extend our gratitude to all the brethren that have supported the work through the Society’s arrangements for special publishers and missionaries to continue in their assignments, here and in other parts of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is not an easy territory in which to witness, as the country is too rich with its oil, gold and other natural resources. The cost of living is fabulously high. Despite these conditions, excellent progress has been made during the year in presenting the gospel of the Kingdom. The increase of work has been good, not only in the placing of literature and the hours spent in the field, but also in the number of publishers, which increased from 13 to 29 and reached a peak of 47 during this service year. The shout of the few publishers there, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations,” is being heard, and the people are listening, as the report which follows shows. A Branch office was established September 1, in the city of Caracas, and this has aided in the organization of the work and in the progress made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All features of the Kingdom service have increased during this service year. The Caracas company increased from 8 publishers to 23 during the year. Another company in the interior increased from 2 publishers to a peak of 10 during the month of July. At the beginning of the service year there were only two companies reporting time to the Branch office, but now five companies are reporting and giving praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In November four more Gilead graduates arrived in Caracas, to take up pioneer work and help the expansion work in Venezuela. A strange land, a foreign language, and queer customs made it difficult for these brethren to put in their time and fulfill pioneer obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the blessings and privileges of service that the publishers enjoyed was that of the commencing of street work in the early part of the service year. It was amazing for the missionaries to place as many as 25 or 30 magazines in a short time on Saturday evening. A Gilead graduate reported this rare experience that he had in the street work: “Among the various features of the witness work, street work proved to be the most unusual during the last four days of the religious ‘holy week’ in Caracas. With all business places closed and many people just roaming the streets I decided to devote most of my time to street work and meet people who are ordinarily difficult to find at home. However, on the first day it was found that more interest was given to the books displayed rather than the magazines. Magazines being few at the time, books were placed on the street corner instead. It was surprising to see five or six books placed in about half an hour and people gather around to hear more. The first afternoon with little effort I had placed eighteen bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The next day I decided to try something different. If the people had nothing to do and would listen, why shouldn’t I talk to them? After all, the sidewalk was very wide in this place and passage would not be obstructed. So, early the second day with a bag full of books I stood on the street corner with Bible In hand and, to passers-by who stopped to listen, talked to them impromptu on subjects of general interest. To my surprise in one hour I had placed about twenty books. On taking Inventory I found to my amazement that during four eventful days of praising Jehovah on the streets and in the market places as had Jesus and the apostles, I had placed 178 books and Bibles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Caracas company started group witnessing in July. The outcome has been very satisfactory. A number of new publishers have had the privilege of starting in the service and receiving instruction in the proper way to witness. The majority of the publishers turn out for the contact point every Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are seven general pioneers working together with the six specials in the vast territory comprising a population of about 4,000,000. Truly it can be said of this country that the ‘field is great but the laborers few’. Two of these general pioneers have just recently joined the full-time ranks. One young, zealous general pioneer working in the city of Caracas gave this account: “While witnessing in the village of Petare, I had an interesting talk with a lady and as soon as I offered her the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Truth Shall Make You Free’</span><span class="font4"> In Spanish she invited me in and asked me to sit down. She then inquired if I was an Adventist, and I informed her, ‘No, senora, I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ As soon as I said this the situation changed and she went into her bedroom looking for something. After a few minutes she came out with a booklet in her hand entitled ‘Keys of the Kingdom’ and said that she had read it many times. I asked her where she had obtained the booklet, and she answered that she received it from a North American lady that visited her sometime ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I saw that she was very much interested in the truth and that she had a good knowledge of the booklet, so I explained to her about having a book study in her home. After a short time she visited the Kingdom Hall and I explained to her about field service. When I invited her to go out with me she said she would do so with great pleasure, and so she goes with me one day every week. Shortly thereafter she symbolized her consecration to Jehovah God through baptism in water. She says that she will continue until Armageddon doing the most important work in this old world, looking for the ‘other sheep’ of the good Shepherd.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we approach the new service year we enthusiastically look forward to further extending the Kingdom message to these bedarkened people. Public meetings will soon be started, which will be one great help toward giving a witness here. Thus far, servant to the brethren work has not been inaugurated. It will commence during the new year. This will certainly prove to be a great blessing, as the brethren have pleaded for someone to come and instruct and organize them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark218"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory known as British West Africa comes under the supervision of the Society’s Branch at Lagos, Nigeria. This Branch directs the work in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone. There is much work still to be done, but a splendid activity was carried on during the past year. Many persons who were steeped in paganism, fetish worship and various demoniacal practices are now coming to a knowledge of the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses have many real problems to meet in this regard. In addition to these things, the religious organizations oppose the work strenuously and have seen to it that bans have been placed against the work in times past, some of which continue in part of the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The arrival of graduates of Gilead who are taking up the missionary work in these localities opens up a new chapter of history for the work in British West Africa. The brethren in this part of the field feel that a long-needed help has at last come. They look to 1948 for more real expansion in carrying on the praise of the Most High. The Branch servant’s report on the territory under his jurisdiction is interesting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Over the past years requests have been sent to head office for help to be sent out in the form of specially trained representatives to assist in the organization of the work. A promise was made that Gilead-trained brethren would be sent as soon as arrangements could be made. Great was the joy when news was received that three Gilead graduates had left New York en route for Nigeria. The meeting of the Branch servant and Bethel family with these three brethren on June 21 was a joyful occasion. It is at this point that a new chapter in the work in Nigeria opens up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In harmony with the new organization the companies throughout the country were divided into circuits and one of the Gilead missionaries, Brother A. C. Attwood, was appointed to serve as district servant in addition to his duties at the Branch office. Four assemblies were held, two in July and two in August, four circuits being served. Lagos, Ilesha, Aba and Warri were the centers selected. Due to the continuous torrential rains the attendance at Lagos was smaller than would otherwise have been the case, but this was more than balanced at Ilesha. Eight hundred brethren were in attendance. The crowning feature was the public meeting, at which 5,000 attended. The Town Hall was far too small for such a gathering, and, as the tropical rains had largely finished, the public meeting was held in the open air. An invitation was given to the native king or owa of Ilesha, and he attended in state. The district servant spoke from the Town Hall steps with the loud-speaker on the balcony above. The crowd of 5,000 gathered on the lawns in front. On the platform at the speaker’s side, the owa sat on a special red carpet, fanned by his attendants. As with all the other talks it was necessary to have it interpreted in Yoruba, that all might understand. Forty-one were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in August the Branch servant and district servant set out on a 1,000-mlle trip into the interior. Their schedule Included two circuit assemblies on consecutive week-ends in addition to company visits and additional public lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first assembly was at Aba, where 1,200 were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peak attendances at all the meetings held since the district servant took up his duties add up to 10,000. Additionally, the talk “Announcing the Perfect Government” was carried on a full page by the two leading newspapers in Lagos, thousands of copies going to all parts of the West Coast. At the four circuit assemblies, 419 persons were immersed, as follows: Lagos, 30; Ilesha, 41; Aba, 134; Witrri, 214.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the arrival of the Gilead brethren many points of organization were quickly put into operation. Arrangements in the Bethel home were brought in line with the regular procedure at Brooklyn. The handling of the work in the office, the organization of the companies, the appointment of servants to the brethren, and many other details, are now being attended to. Bringing everything in line with Theocratic arrangements soon makes itself felt in the field. Improved conditions among the companies and proper direction from the Branch office is certain to have a wholesome effect upon the general conduct of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren are not without persecution, which comes mainly from two sources: first the native chiefs; second, the so-called “Christian” religionists. It is customary for the population to grovel on their bellies when the native chief comes into a community. The brethren refuse to do this, and are often brutally beaten. Sometimes they have to flee from their homes and hide in the jungle until the chief leaves the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Christian” religionists stoop to the basest tricks in their persecution of the brethren. For failing to contribute to the churches and religious schools, the religionists get the native chiefs to lead bands of hooligans and break into the brethren’s homes, stealing their belongings and ill-treating them. Little relief can be obtained through the highly prejudiced native courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest problem is the lack of vernacular literature. The majority do not understand English. There is unlimited demand for literature in Yoruba and Ibo, as many of the brethren have nothing to work with, now that all stocks of vernacular literature are exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to lack of literature the book study report is low, as those unable to read the English language have no literature in which they can conduct studies. A study is possible only when an English-reading publisher meets an Engllsh-readlng person of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We look forward with real longing to your visit to Nigeria, Brother Knorr. Never in the history of the work in West Africa has a president of the Society paid a visit. When you come, a wonderful welcome awaits you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is no </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">official</span><span class="font4"> ban on the Society’s publications, but the Catholic-controlled Customs authorities, with the full knowledge and consent of the governor, have refused to allow the Society’s literature to enter the country, seizing and destroying large quantities of books, even including Bibles. The ordinance under which this action is taken is Section 27(1) (a) (ii) of the Customs Ordinance (Cap 132) which states that: “Books, newspapers, and printed matters, which in the opinion of the Comptroller (subject to any directions by the Governor) are seditious, defamatory, scandalous, or demoralizing” may be seized and detained by the Customs authorities. Since Bibles have been seized under this section it is evident that, according to the Roman Catholic comptroller’s reasoning, the Bible must be considered seditious, defamatory, scandalous or demoralizing. From the Devil’s standpoint this is easily understood. Bible exposure of the Hierarchy’s corruption and wickedness is considered seditious to the interests of his evil domain. Since the Hierarchy is the chief defamer of Jehovah’s name and the Bible exposes her as scandalous and demoralizing, his chief interest is to have God’s Word suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> is allowed entry. Repeated representations to the authorities have thus far failed to bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are five hundred publishers in this colony of more than four million inhabitants. They are found in 24 organized companies. The largest company, of about 80 publishers, is found in the capital city of Accra. The companies have been regularly visited by the servant to the brethren, who has done excellent work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a long period of time the Branch servant has been refused permission to enter the country, being marked as an “undesirable alien”; undesirable, apparently, because the truth is undesirable in Hierarchy-influenced domains. However, after renewed efforts to have this restriction lifted, which ineluded the circulating of a petition, permission was obtained for a visit in the spring of this year. An assembly was arranged in Accra. The number of brethren and people of good-will attending numbered 690, with over 1,000 at the public lecture. Forty-four were immersed. The visit was highly successful and put new life into the brethren, who were weary of enforced isolation and government restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same ship that carried the three Gilead graduates to Nigeria also carried two for the Gold Coast. A missionary home is now established in Accra and the influence of these brethren is already being felt. They are conducting many book studies and have reorganized the Accra company on proper Theocratic lines. A big increase is expected.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work of inviting the nations to praise Jehovah has been continuing in this British colony for some years. During the war the brethren were Isolated by bans and restrictions and there has been no increase for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The need for proper organization and Theocratic leadership was readily recognized, and Sierra Leone was placed upon the list of those places requiring Gilead missionary assistance. In the spring of this year three brethren set sail, and arrived at Freetown in June. A missionary home has been established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Freetown company has now been reorganized on proper Theocratic lines. The Gilead-trained company servant served for some time as servant to the brethren in the United States and is well equipped to carry on the work. We shall be eagerly watching the reports month by month, feeling confident that the time has now come for the people of this colony to take their stand for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Climatic conditions in Sierra Leone are very trying. The rainy season lasts for six months of the year, and the rain is heavy, torrential and continuous. Sometimes it will rain for two weeks on end without any letup. During the dry season the heat is intense and the humidity high. It takes time to get used to such a trying climate, and sickness has been the unfortunate experience of the Gilead missionaries during the past two months. However, their determination to continue in the work and the Lord’s blessing upon them will enable them to overcome these difficulties.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world are well acquainted with the actions of the totalitarian state of Yugoslavia toward Christians. During the occupation of Yugoslavia by the Hitler crowd the work was banned and it was impossible to carry on communications with the outside world. Now in Yugoslavia Jehovah’s witnesses are banned and illegal; but that does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses are not preaching the gospel. Throughout the year there were approximately 120 publishers, who put in 7,847 hours talking the Kingdom. The government tried to stop the work definitely by giving the death sentence to the Branch servant, Rudolph Kalle, and arresting 17 other brethren, putting them in prison. The following report from Yugoslavia is from someone who sat in at the trial of these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren were accused as follows: (1) Of working to overthrow by force the popular government and to establish their Fascistic rule. (2) With having theories that weakened the fighting forces of the land. (3) With having relations with the Berne and Brooklyn offices, which they claimed to be Fascist centers working for a third world war, and to protect criminals of World War II. (4) .Treason. (5) In spite of the prohibition they printed 700 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers. </span><span class="font4">(6) They said that freedom here is only on paper and In reality does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the basis of these charges Jehovah’s witnesses, three in number, were sentenced to death, and 12 others to different prison terms up to 15 years. Three were released. At the time of the trial the courtroom was overcrowded. In one part of the hall they had it filled with an organized youth movement crowd, children from 8 to 15, who cheered the decision of the court. The others heard the same with distress, but they dared not protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fine point of the trial was when a young brother made this statement: “Wise judges, I received this religion, the teaching from the Bible, from my mother, and I worshiped God. During the time of the occupation by the Germans, my mother was put in prison. Two sisters and my brother were of this same belief as my mother. They took them to Dachau, where they shot them because they were considered to be communists because they worshiped God the way they did. For this same religion I am now found here before the court as a Fascist.” How strange that whatever pleases the government in power is used to crush Jehovah’s witnesses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another high point in court occurred after the sentence was given and the trial had ended when those who were charged were asked if they had anything to say. One of the brothers referred to Matthew 10:16-21, and said : “Our Lord foretold that we would be brought before courts and kings and that we would be beaten and put to death for his name’s sake. We have served God, and we leave the matter in the hands of our Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attitude and the courage of their families who will be left orphans was wonderful. Even their children did not cry. They had been brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and could see the shame of the court. The brethren who were not sentenced to prison are trying to help one another, and will do what they can to relieve the families of the brethren in prison. The brethren in Yugoslavia are courageous, and, regardless of the charges that are brought to bear against them, they will continue to sing the praises of the Most High.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>SONG OF PRAISE TO ALL NATIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have proved themselves by their actions to be fearless in the face of all opposition. Nothing, by the Lord’s grace, will stop them from singing the song of praise to all the nations. The year’s report for the 1947 service year proves this very thing. ‘There is no weapon formed against them that will prosper,’ because “God is with us”. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all the world, because they delight to do the will of their Father. (Ps. 40:8) They are convinced that “no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.”—Matthew 6: 24, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing this truth, they do not try to serve the world nor please its religious, commercial or political elements; nor will they try to destroy any part of this old world. They are neutral and seek first the Kingdom and how to please God and carry out his principles of righteousness. If, in their work of praising God and taking the righteous course, Jehovah’s witnesses experience no objection or opposition from nations or groups of people, this is good and beneficial to the people; but, even if certain groups or nations are displeased and opposed to their preaching activity, Jehovah’s witnesses must carry on just the same. Jehovah’s witnesses are called of God through Christ to do this work! As it is stated in John 15:16, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.” This they will continue to do by heralding forth the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, trying to disciple all nations regardless of persecution, bans, concentration camp or threatened death. Nothing will separate them from the love of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has indeed been a pleasure to meet so many of the brethren world-wide and to see the zeal and good works all are doing to the praise of God. All of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are surely joining in the song as set forth in the yeartext for 1948, which says, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” (Ps. 57:9, A.S.P.) This you will continue to do during 1948 and right on through to the establishment of the New World, by continuing in the world-wide expansion work in behalf of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I want to take this occasion, too, to extend the love and greetings of all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere to all of the Lord’s servants in other parts of the earth, as the Branch servants have requested me to do in their reports. Additionally, thousands of brethren in many countries have asked me personally to convey to their associates world-wide their love for you and to assure you of their devotion to God. It is a pleasure to do this, and it shows the unity and unselfish devotion of one toward another. God’s spirit has wrought this! It is not an expression in word only, but in deed. Their love is genuine. It is with much joy that I submit to all the servants of God your year’s report to the Society, and I want all of you to be assured of my love and prayers as we sing together, praising Jehovah among the nations.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, held its annual meeting on October 1, 1947. The meeting was called to order at ten o’clock in the forenoon at the offices of the Society in the Wabash Building, 410 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, presided and opened the meeting by calling upon Charles H. Stewart, Sr., for prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The terms of two directors expired, namely, F. W. Franz and H. H. Riemer. Both of these brethren were unanimously re-elected to serve on the board of directors for the following three years. It was also announced that M. G. Henschel was elected by the board of directors to fill the vacancy made on the board by the death of W. E. Van Amburgh. The usual reports of the activity of the Society were made, and the annual meeting was adjourned at 11:40 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On October 9, according to Charter provisions, the full membership of the board of directors of the said Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a nonprofit Pennsylvania corporation, met in the offices of the Society at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York, at 1 p.m. This meeting was for the election of officers. By unanimous vote on the part of all the directors the former officers of the Society were re-elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the election of officers, certain matters of business were considered, and then director T. J. Sullivan presented the statement which follows to the board of directors and requested that the statement be published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> This was seconded by H. H. Riemer and F. W. Franz and unanimously carried by united vote of all the members of the board of directors. The statement follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We, the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in annual meeting, having completed the 223</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">election of officers of the Society by the re-election of the officers who have served during the past year, voice our sincere thanksgiving to Jehovah God for the blessings which he has showered upon his work and his people during the year past. We gladly acknowledge that the marvelous progress of the witness work around the earth is because he has blessed his servants, has guided them, and, by his spirit of power upon those who love him, has prospered the cause which we love so dearly. To him we give thanks and praise, and to him we pray confidently that during the year ahead his worship will be advanced further, to the eternal glory of his most worthy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At these yearly meetings of this board it Is our duty to elect the officers of this Society, that the positions may be filled for another year and the work incident to the offices might be attended to. In this we ever seek the guidance of our heavenly Father, that his will may be performed, and we know that this direction of the Lord God has been given. This board has unanimously re-elected Brother Nathan H. Knorr as president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. This action, which we have taken so wholeheartedly, Is an extreme pleasure for us, because It enables us to express to the Lord, to all of our brethren, and to Brother Knorr himself, our appreciation of the fact that the rich blessing of Jehovah on the work of the president of the Society during the past year shows that he is the man to be put back on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We both appreciate and approve the management of the corporate affairs of this Society by its executive president, and the program for pushing further afield the message of The Theocratic Government. With Brother Knorr, and with our brethren who are situated in every land, we unitedly look to our King and Leader, Christ Jesus, with assurance of victory for the cause of true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So it is that out of love for Brother Knorr and out of appreciation as herein expressed, we go on record, and we wish this action by the board of directors in formal meeting to be made known to Jehovah’s witnesses In the forthcoming 1948 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YEARTEXT FOR 1948</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.&quot; —Psalm 57:9, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Praising God among the nations has been the theme of Jehovah’s servants ever since Christ commanded his disciples, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.” A Christian’s desire is to always do the will of Almighty God, and this Christians have done because they know that the only way for a person to gain life eternal is to preach God’s truth and, furthermore, they know that the Sovereign of all the universe will back them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note the determined mind of Jehovah’s witnesses in this regard during the past few years. In 1944 they chose as their year’s text, “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God.” (Ps. 143:10) As true Christians have always done, here again they showed their submission to the will of God and declared their keen desire to be taught and learn of Jehovah. By consecrating themselves to do Jehovah’s will, they have shown they have the right heart and mind toward God, and therefore they were taught God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christians today are not desirous of retaining knowlege for their own benefit, to glory in the wisdom they have gained from the good book, the Bible. But they have declared themselves, as expressed in the 1945 yeartext, as determined to tell others what they know; and they chose as their theme for the year, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:19, A.S.P.) One translation says, “teach all the nations.” Jehovah’s witnesses had been doing this for years, but, by the Lord’s grace, they were now more determined than ever to teach all nations. They wanted to use their Scriptural education; for they knew that by preaching they would save not only themselves, but others also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their theme for the following year, 1946, was an invitation to “be glad, ye nations, with his people”. (Rom. 15:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses were not glad because of the world distress and the sorrow that fell upon all the nations, but they were glad because they knew of God’s kingdom, the only hope for the world. They invited all the nations and people of good-will coming from every kindred and tongue to share in this same joy and gladness. This could be done by the people who were sighing and crying in the world only by seeking after truth and righteousness. Thousands of persons of good-will did so; they heard the good news and were made glad with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just bringing comfort to those who mourned was not the end of the matter; so in 1947 the call went forth throughout the world, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” (Ps. 117:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> This is a work of organization, bringing together all the people of good-will who were made glad with His people, and inviting them to sing the praises of the Most High in all the earth. The year’s report in this publication shows that thousands heard the call and praised and lauded the name of the Most High throughout the year. But it will not end there, just as the preaching of the gospel announcing God’s kingdom has not ended at any time since Christ took to himself his power and began to reign. This gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness, and all those who have come to a knowledge of the truth will continue to give this witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus everyone who has been praising God among all the nations can join wholeheartedly in the year’s text for 1948, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.” Each individual will take his stand alone if necessary. Each one will remain wide awake and continue to sing the good news, praising God continually. If the nations lose their equilibrium, as they did in 1938 and thereafter, and drive Jehovah’s witnesses underground, then individually each one will continue to sing in his manner, helping the people of goodwill. If, by the Lord’s grace, he finds himself in a nation where there are no restrictions, he will sing just the same. No man or organization or nation can take away from the faithful individual his God, nor the truth that he has gained from God’s Word; therefore, nothing will stop him from singing in this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each one of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide will say with his companion workers, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations”; and, by God’s grace, each one, in all the nations of the earth, will continue to carry on the expansion work that has been started, and will continue right on down to Armageddon. There is much singing yet to be done, and this song shall be heard even unto the ends of the earth. As each one keeps his place within the Lord’s organization and sings, certainly the praises of God will be heard among all nations. Keep your place in God’s organization, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">SING!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The physical eyes are one of man’s choicest possessions, for they are so necessary to his complete happiness. But more to be prized than eyes of flesh in the head is what the Scriptures speak of as the “eyes of understanding” or “eyes of the heart”. The person that has the latter, although he may be physically sightless, is more favored and has far better possibilities of everlasting life than the one without such although having physical sight. It takes eyes of a spiritually inclined heart to see and accept the things set before the church of God by God’s written Word. If we look at the things in His Word with a blank stare that is held stifle and motionless by the religious creeds and traditions of men in our minds, then we shall be looking at his Word but shall not see what it contains or understand what it teaches. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is the great Unifier and Peacemaker. He is the Father of “The Prince of Peace”. He gave mankind a natural basis for being united and at peace with one another, and that is that they are all of one flesh and blood. Jehovah God “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth”. (Acts 17: 26) Had Adam and his wife Eve kept on in obedient relationship with their Creator, their children would naturally have been born as children of God, and in righteousness and perfection. This perfect family would have been all united around the worship of the one God, and such common worship and love of God would have barred out all division, confusion and discord with one another. The harmonious worship of the one living and true God, whom all the scriptures proclaim to be Jehovah, is the basic principle for an undivided, peaceful new world.

<p><span class="font4">When the blessed privileged position with God was vacated by the Jewish church because of their rejecting His promised Messiah, the newly organized ehurch under Jesus Christ the Head succeeded to the favored place as the spiritual Israel of God, his “new creation”. They had the circumcision of the heart, inward cleanness of mind, in place of the outward circumcision of the flesh. (Gal. 6: 15, 16) Upon them are fulfilled the special blessings foretold in the oracles of God which had previously been held only by the Jewish church. For this reason the new “church of God” under Jesus Christ came under a special responsibility, even heavier than that which had rested upon the Jewish church because of the greater and higher favor shown to Christians. They must be judged by God according to the grander privileges and opportunities that He conferred upon them. TV </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Under provocation Christ’s follower will wisely muzzle his mouth and prevent a loose, uncontrolled torrent of words. If he talks at all it will be with measured words and according to the counsel of God’s Word. He will talk for edification of the provoker and of other listeners, rather than to make slips of speech that stir up more strife and contention. He knows the power of words both upon the speaker and upon the hearers. A witness of Jehovah has difficulties enough without having to pave the way for additional self-imposed troubles by rash speech. What he wants to get across to others with his lips is the message of Jehovah’s kingdom. He will shoulder all the trouble that proclaiming the message brings upon him from the enemies, but he does not care to make trouble for himself by ill-advised words and so make obstacles. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.—Ps. 103:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is matchless in the expressing of mercy and the forgiving of sins. Mercifulness cannot be viewed as a sign of weakness. It is no sentimental softness unbecoming to a God of all-power. It is the expression of wonderful love, the outflow of his perfect unselfishness, but it operates with all due respect for his justice. He exercises it with the utmost of wisdom, and hence in the final outcome it will show itself to have been the right thing to exercise in full vindication of Jehovah’s name. Its exercise is something that discloses him as different from just a cold and heartless all-conquering force in the universe. Mercy is a quality that has acted as a mighty check upon his all-might which might otherwise have been used to blot out all humankind completely. It is consistent with the fact that Jehovah God is love. W 4/</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Men are of the earth, earthy, like the clay of which a potter shapes his vessel, destroying it if it turns out unsatisfactory; and so we have no grounds for complaint against Jehovah God, who is the Creator, supreme in his universal sovereignty and also almighty. While he endures his opposers for his appointed times, he holds wrath against them or appoints them to an eventual expression of his wrath. Thus he sets them apart as “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction”. The final destruction of the last surviving ones of such “vessels of destruction” will bring to a full end his time and need of endurance. His destruction of them shows that they lose and he wins. But during this period of his endurance he goes ahead with his glorious purpose and shows mercy upon certain human vessels. These he sets aside for the opposite of destruction, namely, eternal life, in glory. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is only one visible organization where peace and unity should and must exist, and where they do exist, and it is the organization of Christ’s falsely accused brethren. They stick to the fact that they were bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and are no longer their own, and therefore they are obliged to serve God, who thus bought them, and not serve men of this world. They publicly give their word of testimony and do not care if this course of action costs them their human lives. They do not let Satan’s terrorism make them surrender to his world organization by denying Jesus’ blood and by silencing their testimony as Jehovah’s witnesses. They cling fast to God’s Theocratic organization, which is His </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font4"> and their mother.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.—Mark 12:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God knows man better than man himself. With His knowledge and understanding of his creation, he gave the law that Israelites should love their neighbors, including the sojourning strangers, as they did themselves. Jesus, too, knew man and how man's mind works. He knew that man, whether Christian, Jew, or neither such, loved himself. He knew you would feed yourself, clothe yourself, shelter yourself, all because you loved yourself. Hence he was not speaking contrary to human nature when he said you loved yourself and that the second commandment of God was that you should love also your neighbor to the same degree. Never do you, intelligently and with foresight, try to do wrong to yourself, and you should not do so, because you love yourself so much. That is natural, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Different from the six executioners with battle-axes, the Christian company pictured by the linen-clad man are not equipped for violent combat and destruction. They are neutral toward the conflicts that divide Christendom into hostile camps, because they have a commissioned service from God that assigns to them other work, on which they are bound to turn in a final report. Their God-given righteous work is denoted by the writer’s inkhorn at the man’s side. It has to do with the inspired written Word of God and with publishing it to those who stand in danger because the execution of God’s wrath is threatening Christendom and all nations allied with her in an international compact. From this peaceable, salutary work God’s anointed servants cannot turn aside to intermeddle with the conflicts and strife of doomed Christendom and her allies. Neither can they undertake the destructive work delegated to the six men. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

He is the Rightful Ruler whom God has raised up for a new world of righteousness, and now he is coming into his own. His taking over complete control of the earth is without selfish motives, for it has only the glory of God and the lasting welfare of persons of good-will in view. It is certain to result in the blessing of all the families and nationalities of the earth. The King is entirely devoted to the regenerating of a new world of righteousness. The advance that he is now pushing throughout the universe is to gather all the willing ones to the side of the Sovereign of all creation, Jehovah, where they may loyally worship Him as God. Only the combined allegiance of all creatures that live to the Most High God and their united worship of Him will result in universal peace, happiness and stability for ever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.—Matt. 6: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without question, by this illustration Jesus was teaching a great spiritual truth respecting the “eyes of the heart” or mental vision of spiritual things. To discern the truths brought by God’s inspired prophets and servants and which are recorded in his Word, the Bible, we must have what corresponds to the single eye. In other words, our vision must be pure, our view of things must be from a pure heart that loves the truth and that is eager to find it and grasp and possess it. When w’e look we must be in the search for the truth of God. The connection of the heart with the vision makes the eye like the window through which the heart looks and takes a view of things. “For from w’ithin, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, . . . an evil eye.” An evil heart will result in looking at things in an impure way. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength.—Rev. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his firstborn Son, who became the Messiah, the Christ, the great Creator laid the foundation of the universe that has been created, visible and invisible. This is true because his firstborn Son was the first of God’s creations. Then with him as His active agent God went on to create everything else that has been brought into existence. So it is but reasonable that with this same one Jehovah God should start the new world of righteousness to replace the “present evil world”. For the sake of the righteous new world God’s firstborn Son presented himself in sacrifice and submitted to a violent death on earth, and for this reason he is honorably called “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world”. (13:8) With him as the new world’s foundation the proposed world is sure to be righteous and ever faithful to Jehovah God. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 7: 2, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is not saying that a single Christian cannot keep from committing immorality in this lustful world. But if it should come to choosing between immorality and wedlock, then the servant of God that cannot hold himself in check should take the honorable course. He should get married according to God’s law and in compliance with all proper regulations of government of the country. This is so because the Creator instituted marriage, and marriage according to His will and in harmony with His purpose is not sinful or unclean. Rather than lead a free and loose life in frequent fornication and at the same time appear to lead a single life, the Christian will undertake the responsibilities and the restraints and will get married. He will thus keep clean in God’s sight and honorable before men and not bring reproach on God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Every Scripture is divinely inspired and is profitable for instruction.-—2 Tim. 3:16, Spencer, Rom. Cath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The compound Greek word translated “divinely inspired’’ literally means “God-breathed” or “breathed by God”. Not that God breathes the atmosphere about our earth and breathed it upon the human writers of the Bible, but that he sent forth his invisible active force. He exerted it upon the thirty men or so that wrote the sixty-six books of the Bible. The holy spirit or active force of God is invisible to our eyes, and Hebrew writers spoke of it with words meaning also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">breath,</span><span class="font4"> and Greek writers spoke of it with the word meaning also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">wind</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">breath.</span><span class="font4"> Hence anything produced by the exercising of God’s invisible active force upon it can be said to be God-breathed or divinely inspired. In fact, the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inspired</span><span class="font4"> of Latin origin means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">breathed into,</span><span class="font4"> denoting unseen force.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.—Isa. 26: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This does not mean entering some underground, atom-bombproof shelter. The place of safe hiding is no particular place on earth, such as a “refuge farm” or the like, but is the condition of worshiping Almighty God in spirit and in truth. According to Christ Jesus God may now be worshiped acceptably anywhere on earth. (John 4:23,24) The prophet Moses, to whom God revealed his name Jehovah, said of the only safe place of hiding: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress.” (Ps. 91:1,2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.</span><span class="font4"> Ver.) The true worship of Him is the thing required to bring us into the protected hiding place.

(Heb. 1:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font4"> What also makes him most fair beyond compare is his perfect qualities which so completely fit him for his high office and for the work he has to do in vindicating God’s name and sovereignty and in delivering and blessing all men of good will. While on earth, “learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” As regards obedience to God he was made “perfect through sufferings”, so that his integrity toward the Most High God is without a single flaw and no creature is equal to him in integrity. —Heb. 5:8; 2:10. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10</span><span class="font4">/I</span></p>

The fruitage of this will be-an abiding peace. If we sincerely are God’s people amidst this corrupt, disordered world, we shall now find ourselves in all lands trying to come to an organization of unity in all the earth, because we are the one people of God. This effort springs from the right kind of wisdom, and it aims in the direction of u righteous peace. Such wisdom descends from a source higher than men. It comes down from the great Father of lights. It is a wisdom that results in Theocratic organization and in the growth of peace.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 118:22, 23, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The builders’ rejecting of the stone included the putting of Jesus to death as if not fit to be king or head. Correspondingly, the making of the Stone to be the head of the corner included, yes, rested upon the raising of the rejected Stone, Jesus Christ, from the dead. Only Jehovah God, the great Builder of all things, could do this. Psalm 118:23 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> had predicted it would be “Jehovah’s doing”; and it was. On the third day of Jesus’ lying dead in “hell” Jehovah God sent prosperity to his Kingdom cause by saving his faithful Son, The Stone, from the dead and not leaving his soul in “hell”. In spite of the Bible prophecies that foretold it, even Jesus’ own disciples did not expect it. Hence his resurrection was “marvellous” in their eyes, and justly so, because it was God’s greatest miracle, “the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/5</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The prodigal son squandered what his father gave him in riotous living, which doubtless included intoxication and overeating as well as “living with harlots”, fornication. He repented of his course and decided to convert to a life of service of his forsaken father, throwing himself upon his father’s mercy. Had the boy sinned too far for his father to forgive? Did the father repulse him ? No. He accepted his returned son’s confession and forgave him with joy. This prodigal pictures the persons of good-will today, who are the great Shepherd’s “other sheep”. Mindful of this parable, these may take heart in repentantly abandoning this world and seeking Jehovah’s face through Christ.

<p><span class="font4">This shows how the remnant of Christ’s faithful servants fares at the end of the world at his sudden arrival at the temple in 1918. From this it is plain that even before the members of the remnant finish their earthly course they have a measure of judgment executed toward them by the Lord at the temple, in that he retains them in his service because he finds them faithful at their duties in the household of God. He executes judgment against the evil, slothful, self-seeking servant by taking away from such a class the talent or pound of service privileges inside Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and by then putting them out of the organization, to be condemned with the world and to share its tearful fate.—12: 46. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

By looking to him as the perfect illustration of what to do when the running in the race-course to everlasting life seems rough, grueling, lengthened-out and almost exhausting, it gives us a new infusion of strength to pace onward closer to the prize, with fresh joy at our privilege. “Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.” (12:3) Jesus was able to go straight forward despising the thought of the tree of torture, because of the joy of witnessing to the truth of God’s kingdom down till the tree and then the joy of rising from the dead and ascending to God’s right hand, there to see God's work through to its finish and to vindicate His name by the Kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

None of the apostles and their fellow Christians perished in that slaughter, but they could turn in a report to God clean of responsibility for the frightful slaughter of the Jews with stubborn foreheads who had resisted the education of their minds in the truths about Jehovah’s true Messiah.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Col. 1:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This deliverance and translation of the members of the true church of Jehovah God is something that takes place while they are still in the midst of this world. The consequence is that they are in the world, but not of it, just as Christ Jesus was. (John 8:23; 17:14,16) The darkness from which they have been delivered is that of this world, and such darkness is due to the unseen control of this world by its god, Satan the Devil, “the prince of the demons.” To keep their delivered estate or liberty in Christ his followers must therefore wrestle against the influence of these spirit demons that dominate the world and keep it in the darkness of ignorance and divine wrath. (Eph. 6:11,12) Only by doing so can they hold fast to “the inheritance of the saints in light”.—Col. 1:12. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophesy</span><span class="font4"> here means to publicly tell forth things stated in the prophecies of God’s Word, the Bible, although, by the spirit of God which was poured out at Pentecost, the gift of prophecy in the sense of foretelling things was also bestowed upon some. Certainly, if anointed with the outpoured spirit, the other women, aside from Philip’s four daughters, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">prophesied</span><span class="font4"> in the sense of telling out to others not yet of the church the things contained in God’s prophecies or occurring in fulfillment of such prophecies. In thus prophesying they were, in the highest sense, ministers of God. Hence it is altogether Scriptural that consecrated women today, young and old, virgins and married, who have God’s spirit upon them and who go from house to house spreading God’s message by word and by printed page, be considered and treated and classified as “ministers of God”. —Rom. 16:1.

As with a human infant at birth, so it is true with anyone that is a babe in the knowledge of the things of God's “present truth”. At first it is all unfamiliar ground and he can see little of what is at first revealed to him. But if he 1ms an honest heart that seeks to learn to know and to retain what he learns, he will keep on peering into the pages of God's Word and into the operations of his Theocratic organization. lie then grows in familiarity therewith. (Mark 8:17,18,21) With good remembrance and familiarity he increases in perceptive powers, that is, in powers to select or pick out various things and to distinguish them from other things and to detect details and peculiar features. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

As far as depends upon us, we should seek to get along in peace with those devoted to the truth and wanting to serve God. If we love the truth, then let us look above our personal feelings and desires to the one over-all purpose of the Lord’s organization in Christ. Then we will rise above petty personal things of strife and will go along harmoniously with our brethren in the paramount service of God. We must get along accordantly with one another in His organization. Are we not all subject to like regulations and witnessing obligations, all targets of the one common enemy, the world, and all bound together in the one purpose of vindicating God's name? Yes!

<p><span class="font4">In 1914 Christ Jesus the Anointed King asked for the nations. Hence the activities of Jehovah's witnesses, who are subject to His King, must be carried to all peoples, nations and languages. It is in the highest public interest to do this, and it is most urgent upon Jehovah’s witnesses to reach all nations. Why? Because immediately after Jehovah invites the new King to ask for the nations and uttermost parts of the earth as his inheritance and possession he commands his King saying: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (2:9) That means the destruction of the nations at Armageddon, uot by Jehovah’s witnesses on earth, but by the iron-like rod of the heavenly King Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font4">It does not matter whether one is a witness of Jehovah or not, each and every one is liable to faults in the use of the tongue. As long as Christians are in the imperfect flesh, the tongue will remain beyond taming to perfection. Be merciful to offenders, if repentant. We cannot look for perfection of speech among even the congregations of faithful Christians. The fundamental reason is that these are still in the imperfect flesh with its inclinations to sin, and perfection is not to be expected of them in word or in deed. Hence Christians that are teachers of others stand in a very responsible position and need to be very careful not to use their vocal powers for wrong purposes as well as not to teach false doctrine. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

His solving of all matters will stand forever without appeal therefrom and without reversal. Righteousness will come fully in control of this earth, and all lovers of truth and righteousness on earth will find relief and will joyfully honor and praise the great “Judge of all”. His great “judgment day” is something to look forward to with heartfelt desire and thankfulness. All those who are innocent and in the right and wanting justice done do not dread the coming of court days when the judge must sit on the bench and the trying of important cases under dispute must go forward to a final decision.

<p><span class="font4">What if you do read the Bible and claim to believe it with the heart or mind? If you do not make confession with your mouth to other persons, to that neighbor whom you are commanded to love, you will be lacking in that which contributes to salvation, namely, confession with the mouth or with whatever means of expression lie within your power. Therefore it is your confessing to others about God’s kingdom, it is your praising of God, it is your preaching of the good news, it is your using of your mouth or of your powers of expressing thought and information to others, that guarantees to you, and to each one of us, life eternal in the new world through Jesus Christ. It is essential for us to confess with the mouth.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.—Heb. 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Jesus' case the sufferings for righteousness’ sake served to prove that God’s most trusted servant could not be driven by sufferings to rebel against the universal sovereignty of his heavenly Father, but that he stood firm for it in the midst of an opposing world. The benefit to Jesus was that by such sufferings that God let come to him for no fault of his own he learned perfect obedience to God his Father. He showed that his obedience was no shallow, superficial thing but was motivated by perfect love toward God. Hence he was fearless of any present painful consequences for rendering perfect obedi-epce to God. By this faithful and obedient course he vindicated God as the rightful Sovereign of the universe, and God his Father rewarded him with the appointment to be his Chief Servant in finally vindicating God’s universal sovereignty and sacred name. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God's law as expressed through his prophet Jeremiah and as quoted by the apostle Paul is: “That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” (Jer. 9: 23, 24; 1 Cor. 1:31) To God’s real people this command spares no room for praising the political and economic wise men, the mighty military men, and the popes and higher clergy who are rich in material wealth and worldly honors. Did lauding and glorifying such political, commercial, military and religious elements ever lead the people to life, lasting peace and prosperity? Never; but the effect has been to shove the only Giver of life and peace to the side and to put men at enmity with him. According to God’s own words it is inescapable that all men that live shall bow the knee to Jehovah God and swear and confess to him. Why not start doing so now?

<p><span class="font4">The prime mover of sedition against him Jehovah still lets go on in his way. Today the great danger to men and women is that of being drawn into the wicked movement and being found in it when it is finally put down by wholesale execution of all the seditionists at Armageddon. The Lord God has let it continue on into this postwar era for the testing of the loyalty of men and women to Him. That is a leading reason why he has permitted such seditious wickedness all this while until at last he vindicates his universal sovereignty. His vindication will mean life and joy to all the loyal ones. Hence the timely command of Psalm 117: 1 now goes forth: “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan.

Old men, young men, parents, children, masters, servants, all consecrated believers of flesh and blood were favored with the outpouring of the spirit that all together might call upon the name of the Lord God and praise his name Jehovah and be saved through his anointed King and Lord, Jesus Christ. There were times when all such were inspired, as, for instance, when they all “began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance”, to speak the “wonderful works of God”. (Acts 2:4,11) Sometime afterward believers of Samaritan flesh “received the holy spirit”, together with its inspired gifts. (Acts 8: 14-17) Not long afterward the first Gentile converts were heard to “speak with tongues, and magnify God”.

<p><span class="font4">There must come a specific day or season in the future when there would be a special judgment time of the house or church of God. There was such a final judgment-time that came upon the Jewish church with tie Messiah’s arrival, and that was a prophetic picture of what must likewise come upon the Christian church that succeeded to the place of God’s favor when tie Jewish church was finally cast out for unbelief and disobedience. Thus a day or period comes in which all the church together is put on judgment and the decisions are finally rendered and the rewards or recompenses are handed out by the divine Court. This is at the time that the great Judge, Jehovah God, or his judicial Associate, Christ Jesus, comes for the holding of judgment, beginning with the “house of God”. This is when its prospective membership of 144,000 is complete and its last members are on the earth.

<p><span class="font4">Among Jesus’ Jewish disciples the Lord’s supper on each Nisan 14 took the place of the passover. Thus the day which Jehovah God appointed for a memorial to Almighty God the Lord Jesus did not push aside. He held on to it, to mark it by a different celebration of larger meaning. For a certainty, when setting up a memorial for his body-members on Jehovah’s memorial day of Nisan 14 our Lord Jesus was not instituting a celebration more in his own honor than in Jehovah’s honor. Christ’s death, while it also accomplished the ransoming of humankind, was primarily for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and universal sovereignty. His body-members celebrate the memorial to Jehovah’s honor, but with remembrance of Jesus Christ as the one whom Jehovah uses chiefly for His vindication and as the One whom all Christians must imitate, with integrity to the death. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

But if we appreciate being in under those reproaches and oppositions on the side of Jehovah God and bearing up under them for the vindication of his side of this issue, it will nerve us to endurance. Just for that we are glad to be in there under the endurance test no matter how long it lasts. Pleasing ourselves means pleasing the Devil’s world, but to please God with all the lasting power of our minds and bodies is what we want. In order to do so, we must turn to the Scriptures which the God of endurance caused to be written for our present needs. All those Scriptures testify to the unceasing antagonism between the Devil’s world and God and his people. To be with God and on his side puts us directly in the line of fire of the opposition forces.

Instantly, when the postwar era set in, they displayed their hearts to be ready, not to praise the organization of the United Nations, but to praise Jehovah God. How? By going right on with their witness work in all nations. They had not turned aside from it during the global war, and they would not now turn aside just because the peacetime had come.

Very evidently, then, what made him the same person, both after he laid aside his heavenly glory and became man, and then after he sacrificed his human nature and was resurrected to spirit life once more and forever, was the preserving of his personality. In the resurrection Jehovah God re-created the personality of Jesus. That included all the qualities of perfected obedience and fully tested integrity that Jesus had acquired through his faithful course on earth.

<p><span class="font4">The believer now deals with the mate from a sanctified viewpoint. In God’s eyes they are one flesh, and when one of the married pair sanctifies himself to God then the other one of the one flesh is affected and undergoes an indirect sanctification. Certainly snch sanctification could not mean divorcing the unbelieving one who is one’s flesh. It must mean that henceforth what proper, due services and companionship the sanctified believer renders to the unbeliever he does as unto the Lord God whom the believer is consecrated to serve. He must do so, because he may not, except for fornication, break off the marriage tie and oneness of flesh. This fact should be a great comfort to sanctified believers whose mates are not in the truth nor consecrated to God. It should be a blessing, deterring unwarranted efforts at divorce.

<p><span class="font4">Should a sinner feel that the promise of divine forgiveness is for someone else but cannot cover or apply to his sin, and no justification from it could be possible through Christ’s sacrifice? No one should discourage himself to that extent. Yes, he should feel a consciousness of sin due to the reproofs of the gospel message of God and of his Christ; he should have a heart longing to be released from the burden of such sin. That is good, because as long as the gospel cau stir up a repentance in the sinner receiving the message, God’s mercy can embrace that one and hold out to him the forgiveness of sins through Christ. The repentance of the sinner is the hopeful sign for such sinner and is the initial thing that is required.

The whole religious organization of Christendom appears like a “kingdom divided against itself” and like a “city or house divided against itself”.

They must become submerged in obedience under Christ’s leadership in order to gain eternal salvation. Simply the cleaning of themselves up morally in the flesh will not do this. What gains salvation for them is their gaining a clean conscience toward God by the benefit of Jesus’ life-giving sacrifice. He himself was submerged by a baptism into God’s will. Thereafter he did not seek to live according to his own will. Since he submitted to the divine will even into death he lives today only by reason of being resurrected. Likewise his faithful followers, who go down into death in obedience to God’s will, gain life again only by resurrection. This is because their Leader Jesus was the first to be resurrected. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The one who makes himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven’s sake does not literally mutilate himself in the flesh (Deut. 23:1), but dismisses married life from his mind. He devotes himself with singleness of mind and affection and bodily strength to serve God’s kingdom. Virgin maids can take a like course of action and enjoy freedom and blessings to themselves. Widows and widowers can display a like single-hearted devotion by not remarrying but by specializing henceforth on serving that which concerns the kingdom of God. The Christian’s purposes concerning the service of God and of His royal cause are the things that will guide and determine in the Christian’s final decision and choice. Jesus left it up to each Christian’s liberty to decide. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The greatest official servant of the Most High God is his own first Son, Christ Jesus. He holds this exalted place because he is one of “The Higher Powers” with Jehovah God. Every’ Godfearing soul should therefore be in subjection to him as well as to the Supreme Power Jehovah God, because God has ordained him to this place. (Rom. 13:1-4) When on earth as a man Jesus was the model minister of God. He preached the good news of God's kingdom, which God had anointed him with the spirit to preach. (Luke 4: 17-21) By faithfully holding himself to carrying out this appointed service with the help of God’s spirit, he proved himself to be a minister of the gospel of God. No polities, commercialism or militarism for him. Preaching the gospel with absolute neutrality toward the political controversies of this world did not spare him from persecution.

As they fight it out among themselves and mutually batter themselves up, we will stand neutral, but with positive activity for the Kingdom and worship of Jehovah God. We will watch as the Israelites did under King Jehoshaphat. Like them, we will keep up the constructive singing to God’s praise that all the humble and meek of the earth may hear and may join with the singing worshipers of the Most High God.

<p><span class="font4">Persons appointed to positions of special responsibility with special duties in a congregation have an excellent opportunity and a special privilege of supplying the needs of God’s people. If they do so, they show love of their brethren. None of such appointed servants, if he takes a right view of the situation, will think that now because he is in such an appointed position he can sit back, do nothing and merely enjoy the honor of it all. How did he get to his appointed place in the first instance? Only by being first a faithful Kingdom publisher with a suitable record. He was one of the thousands holding that most fundamental and important position in God's visible organization, that of being a publisher of His kingdom. Were it not for the groups of such publishers of God’s message, there would be no such servants put in office, to be servants, not masters. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

A sincere person, however, will be wholehearted in worshiping God, not wanting to deceive himself. Nevertheless, he must be watchful not to spoil the effect and acceptance of that worship by improper speech in the other affairs of life. Being one thing at the one time and the opposite at another time, such a professed worshiper is deceiving himself if he thinks he is getting anywhere by what various forms of worship he offers to God. For pure and undefiled worship in God’s sight the servant of God must not only bless God but also cause his tongue to be a blessing to mankind as well. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">No one should think God will overplay his forbearance, loving-kindness and mercy where a person is hypocritical and tries to take advantage of God’s graciousness in order to keep on indulging a love of sin and unrighteousness. If he loves sin, which is the transgression of God’s law, he does not love God, but hates him. The Second Commandment shows that haters of God cannot trifle with him. It says he brings down the full effect of their iniquity upon them, so that even their offspring to the third and fourth generation are affected thereby. But those who try to prove their love of God by keeping his commands are favored with mercy, in order for them to try again and again in all sincerity to do what is right. To such ones he shows mercy “to a thousand generations”. (A.S.K, margin) That means he is forever merciful to them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This pouring out of God’s spirit upon the flesh of all his faithful anointed witnesses does not mean that those now acting as Jehovah’s witnesses are inspired. It does not mean that the writings in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> are inspired and infallible and without mistakes. We leave it for the pope to claim infallibility, according to his decree of A.D. 1870. But we confess with the Scriptures that the day of such inspiration passed long before 1870, as the apostle Paul showed it would. (1 Cor. 13:8-13) Inspired speaking and writing passed away with the last of the twelve apostles, by whom gifts of the spirit were imparted to others. Yet God is still able to teach and lead us. While confessing to no inspiration for today for anyone on earth, we do have the privilege of praying God for more of his holy spirit and for his guidance of us by it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

The suppressing of Nazi-Fascist types of government over certain nations does not mean Jesus’ words cease to apply. Because it is done for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ, we are resolved to go on in the course that focuses the hatred of all nations and of all men upon us. We have a good conscience toward God, because our conscience is educated according to his Word, and we well understand that to suffer with intelligent conscience toward God draws his approval.

If any then selfishly yield to Satan’s deceptions and rebel against being delivered by Christ over to Jehovah’s universal and everlasting sovereignty, they will be condemned and sentenced to unending destruction, symbolized by the “lake of fire”, which is the “second death”.

The New World created by God’s perfect wisdom and power and ruled by his King is to the front of us. No looking behind for us, nor to either side, with any selfish longing! We might stumble. Our eyes, are at the front of our head; deprived of their guiding vision,' the feet lead or stumble into evil. There is great value in keeping our powers of vision always directed ahead upon the course before us, and, at its end, the blessed prize held in reservation.

<p><span class="font4">Under command not to hole up fearfully behind city walls, Jehovah’s people tramped forth early next morning. But how? With the military forces to the fore? Strangely, no; but with the temple singers at the very head of the marching column. Here the praise of Jehovah was put before militarism, even if that might seem to make His people naked to attack and slaughter. Nevertheless, this faithful and courageous praising of Jehovah led to salvation. During the singing of his praise under such conditions, his honor was put at stake. So he came to the salvation of his covenant-people and fought the battle without their having to shoot a single arrow.

In course of time the doctrine or instruction of the apostles and associated brethren was written down for preservation and was added to the Hebrew Scriptures to form the complete Bible. These new inspired writings, at first written in common Greek for the most part, were of equal authority with the ancient Hebrew Scriptures and formed part of the organization instructions contained in the whole of the Bible. Wherever members of the governing body of the church of the first century found themselves, there organization instructions were issued. The invisible Head of the church, Christ Jesus, was the unseen liaison member between them all to inspire them by the spirit of God and to keep them all in harmony with one another. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

All such Scripture Paul said is divinely inspired and for this reason profitable to the Christians and serving to equip God’s servants for the good work that he has commissioned us to do. It stands to reason, then, that the Christian’s equipment is not complete without the Hebrew Scriptures and the proper understanding of them. In fact, the Christian Greek Scriptures find a foundation and basis in the Hebrew Scriptures; they were written by Christ’s disciples in explanation of the Hebrew Scriptures and show the fulfillment of many important prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures.

In that way, indeed, your tongue will be a “wholesome tongue”, a tree of life bearing good fruits. In that way all witnesses of Jehovah, as they go about from door to door offering the Kingdom fruits to the people, disperse knowledge by their lips and feed many.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 26: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus Christ was the first one to be distinguished with a resurrection to everlasting life.

The faithful Jewish remnant was called out from among the rejected Jewish nation, and the believing Gentiles were thereafter called out from the rest of the nations of the world. All such, Jew and Gentile together, became the people for God's name. This makes them a called-out company, indeed. (Acts 15:14-17) This assembly, congregation or ecclesia is now the church of God, and the Holy Scriptures so speak of them and to them.

It is by the righteous, peaceful means of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and of his vengeance that men today are marked in the forehead. There is no other way to mark them than by bringing them to a knowledge of the Kingdom and God’s purposes by it. The King Christ Jesus declared in prayer to Jehovah: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” Those with foreheads marked by the perception, acceptance and confession of the Kingdom truth are the ones that will call upon God’s name through Christ for salvation in this day of crisis.

The righteousness of his rule is guaranteed to us because of his loving righteousness and hating wickedness.

Because Jesus Christ, the Messiah, had not till then died as a ransom for mankind, the psalmist could not ask for the pardoning of his iniquity and the blotting out of his sins in the name of the Redeemer Jesus Christ. He asked, therefore, for such forgiveness solely for Jehovah’s name’s sake. In due time, for His name’s sake, Jehovah provided Christ Jesus his beloved Son to be the Ransomer of mankind, and Jesus constantly declared that he came in his Father’s name.

No second chance for them in the New World! At Pentecost A.D. 33 the time came for the members of God’s household of sons to become accountable for what they did henceforth. Upon their acts from then on in the flesh the final judgment upon them must be based.

<p><span class="font4">To keep good spiritual vision, we must feed upon good food that nourishes our heart or mind. For our spiritual vision, the food we need is the enlightening food that the Lord provides from the Bible and through his Theocratic organization in Christ. Keep your eyes on this food. If any have suffered impairment of their vision of God’s will and purpose, becoming blinded by selfish things of this world, they should pray to God through Christ so as to receive His spirit, which is like a healing eyesalve. By repenting at the Lord’s loving rebuke and by turning from the blinding things of this world, fix your studious attention upon God’s Holy Word. By studying and applying it we receive of his spirit. Get acquainted with his commandments and instructions for his people in this dark time of the world. Guide your line of vision according to his safe rules.—Ps. 19 : 8.

<p><span class="font4">On the fiftieth day from his resurrection came the feast of Pentecost, when the first-fruits of the wheat harvest were offered to the Lord God at the temple. (Lev. 23: 15-21) On that day of Pentecost Christ’s consecrated followers became alive to God in a spiritual sense by the outpouring upon them of the holy spirit of God. On that same day, with the help of this outpoured spirit, the apostle Peter called public attention to another advance proof in the Hebrew Scriptures of the resurrection. He quoted King David’s prophetic statement, given above, of Psalm 16:8-11. (Acts 2:27-32) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font4"> in which Jesus' soul or existence was not left was the grave. Those in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font4"> are absolutely dead, and not painfully alive in torments.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">They learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.—1 Tim. 5:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan would like to plant evil-speakers among God’s people for the sake of causing hurt and damage to the organization. He is eager to infect members of the organization with the spirit of the world which moves a person to wicked uses of the powers of speech. Idleness from the good works of the Lord allows room for the tongue to wag in unprofitable ways. Instead of imitating the apostle, who taught “from house to house” as well as publicly, those growing careless of their responsibilities to God go from home to home among their Christian brethren and carry gossip that pertains to other persons’ private affairs. This does not upbuild the listeners in a way that the discussion of the Kingdom truth and the service of it would do. It tends to start the listener’s tongue to wagging. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In accepting applause and eulogies of the people men do a disservice to mankind by turning their adoration away from the Supreme One, to whom all praise is due. Such misdirected praise encourages the self-reliant rulers and leaders of this world in their ineffective government of this world. Whoever eulogizes the prominent ones of this world as the saviors of mankind and as the benefactors of humanity is forsaking the law of God as regards praise and is taking away from the Creator his due. Naturally those who do not want to he regulated by God’s law will praise the wicked who are in power, but those who stick to the divine law will contend with the wicked by obeying God and exposing the ungodliness of this world and its lawlessness toward Him. They will not try to please the honor-seeking leaders of this world and tickle their ears by saying unscriptural things. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All the same, Peter and John were ordained ministers of the gospel of God, whereas those educated, cultured justices of law were not such. Jesus did not require Peter and John to go to any religious theological school, but called them to follow him and keep in his company. He taught them doctrine and demonstrated to them how to serve God. He gave them practical training in preaching the true gospel. As his heavenly Father sent him to preach, so he sent his disciples out to preach. God used him at Pentecost to pour out the holy spirit or invisible energy upon the disciples. In this manner they received ordination and power to be God’s ministers of the gospel. Religious theological schools are thus seen to perform no part in the valid ordination of the true ministers of the gospel of God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During the nineteen centuries of waiting at God’s right hand, Christ Jesus has faithfully ministered as High Priest for all his consecrated followers and subjects upon the earth in order to prepare and fit them, to reign with him in the heavens in due time. But now the kingdom of God toward this earth has eome and God has empowered his King, Christ Jesus, to act for him in a governmental way. Now the day has come upon us for the kingdom of Jehovah God, established in the hands of his Christ, to extend its power from heaven and into all parts of our earth. Psalm 110: 1, 2 was notice to Christ Jesus to expect to have a fight on his hands when taking Kingdom power. The enemies would not want him as King. However, Christ Jesus will rule for ever, but not so his enemies. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

But this rule of unselfish neighborliness can be faithfully kept by true Christians in this twentieth century because the “higher powers” to whom to be subject are the Ones from whom and through whom this law came, namely, Jehovah God, by whom the law is given, and Christ Jesus, through whom the law is given. It we subject ourselves to them rather than to the Hitlers, Mussolinis, and other totalitarian dictators and political bosses that get into office and power, then we can and will keep this rule that governs right and helpful conduct toward our neighbors. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 12:3, An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God gives the spirit and spiritual gifts through Jesus Christ. The spirit or active force of God does not operate contradictorily and contrary to itself. It does not cause one man to say that Jesus is accursed and another man to say Jesus is the Lord and Master. Any spirit or active force that causes any person to say a curse upon Jesus must, therefore, be of God’s adversary, the Devil, for God’s spirit is one and is at agreement with itself. It is holy, and therefore it causes Christians to confess God’s holy Son Jesus as the Lord who bought them with his precious blood of human sacrifice. That spirit of God promotes and preserves unity among all on whom it operates. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1 Ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, . . .

Harmoniously with this, when you look for an acceptable, visible governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth now, you look to those who are part of this Theocratic organization, the antitypical Sarah, which is not confined to any one land on earth. Then you look among them for wholly devoted servants of God who arc Theocratically motivated and who are in absolute accord with the Theocratic arrangement and with Theocratic instructions for the organization. We do not look for this governing body to be an inspired body, but do require them to be attached to God’s inspired Word, directing affairs in harmony with it, and publishing its message. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were the natural descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who had been given covenant promises concerning the Seed in whom all families of the earth should one day be blessed. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob pointed forward to the kingdom of heaven, God’s kingdom; all three were in favor of the kingdom of heaven and kept Theocratic law as far as it was given them. In fact, Abraham was a prophetic type of Jehovah, whereas the beloved son Isaac was a type of the Seed, the only begotten Son of God, namely, Jesus Christ. Jacob as Abraham’s grandson was a type of the 144,000 associates of Jesus Christ in the kingdom. It takes, not flesh connections, but faith to enter the kingdom of heaven, and many non-Israelitcs came in faith from east and west to enter into the Kingdom as symbolized by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Whether by direct address of God’s angels or by visions or by dreams or by other invisible operations upon his approved servants, the Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures of the centuries before Christ were produced by inspiration. Therefore they are authoritative and are a valid part of the Holy Bible, God’s Word. In Moses’ day, at Mount Sinai, the terrified Israelites pleaded that God should not speak to them direct any more, but should speak by his prophet. God has since spoken to men indirectly by his prophets, human creatures, but filled and carried along in their expressions by the invisible active force of God, his infallible holy spirit. Men they were, indeed, but inspired with the superhuman spirit of God, and they spoke and wrote in His name, because they were His representatives. The continuing fulfillment of prophecy proves it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">So those partaking of the memorial emblems of bread and wine-cup do openly declare by this that they, as members of Christ’s body (the church), are going down into death with him in support of the kingdom of God. Jesus has said to all these: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10) By eating the memorial bread and drinking the memorial wine, they do proclaim or show forth the one thing, namely, “the Lord’s death.” Since both emblems, unleavened bread and red wine, point to the one and the same thing, namely, Christ’s death in vindication of his Father’s universal sovereignty and sacred name, it is proper that both emblems be taken </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font4"> by Christ’s body-members who celebrate the memorial each year.

<p><span class="font4">Did God authorize the court at Jerusalem to forbid the apostles to preach Jesus as His Messiah? Or did God authorize the apostles to teach in the name of Jesus? That question is answered by getting answer to another question, namely, To whom did God give his holy spirit as foretold in Joel’s prophecy, thereby giving a divine ordination and commission to such anointed ones? Not to the Jewish supreme court, but to Jesus’ apostles, for which reason to obey the court and quit preaching about the Messiah would be to grieve and fight against the holy spirit. God is higher than any human court. The spirit of God is mightier than the orders from any such court. To God as the Highest Power and Authority the apostles must turn in their final report to declare how they had carried out their commission from him and had co-operated with his holy spirit. There was no other choice for them than to obey him and his holy spirit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God’s kingdom as an established working governmental arrangement is now here. That kingdom, with Christ enthroned as Jehovah’s King for the new world, will shortly settle the primary issue of sovereignty, regarding which Jehovah God has beeu so tolerant. Jesus Christ will settle the issue overwhelmingly in favor of Jehovah’s side. The weighty obligation rests upon each one of God’s consecrated people to put that kingdom first and to proclaim it to all the nations for a witness, because the final end of this world is getting so close. Keeping the Kingdom to the fore, we will not make eating and drinking certain things, or eating and drinking at a certain traditional time of the day, so important and urgent that it will interfere with our efforts to proclaim the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font4">To show himself alive from the dead by many infallible proofs and to speak further to his disciples pertaining to the kingdom of God, Jesus had to appear in a visible material body for their eyes to see. However, by doing so he was not trying to prove he had reassumed that fleshly body that he had laid down in death as a sacrifice. He once said he was the bread from heaven and that the bread which he would give for the life of the new world was his flesh, whieh was “meat indeed”, or real food. Hence he would not mock the world by taking his flesh back and leaving them to die, but would let his flesh remain as a sacrifice forever. Then the world could feed on its value and could gain everlasting life. By sacrificing his flesh, he could ascend to heaven and present the value of his human life as a ransom price for all those of mankind who should believe on him. —Heb. 9 : 24-26. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font4"> 4/2</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah here pointed to a certain resurrection upon which the future resurrection of mankind is based. Later prophecies by Jehovah God made plain that bruising the heel of the woman’s seed meant or included the killing of the seed, Christ, lienee if such bruised Seed is to bruise and crush the head of the Serpent, Satan the Devil, who still lives a most active life, it must be after Christ the Seed of God’s woman had been raised from the dead and thus recovered from the bruising of the heel. To the faithful followers of the Seed of the woman the apostle writes: “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” (Rom. 16:20) This, too, must mean the resurrection of these from the dead.

<p><span class="font4">We should not seek to gain anything selfish by means of lying. The selfish enjoying of what is thus gained will surely be cut off in death. If we use the tongue for selfish, worldly purposes hurtful to others, our harmfully wagged tongue will be a power for our own final destruction at God’s hands. Jesus told the religious Pharisees that lied about him and misrepresented the power behind his works that they would be condemned by their words; every word, not yielding good, that they spoke about him and his followers was to be held against them. Without fail they would give account for it in the day of judgment. (Matt. 12:36,37) Nothing of lasting value is to be gained by lying against another.

They do not see everything at a glance. They cover the field of vision gradually, but progressively, like the finder beam of a television recorder. In that way the whole picture is built up out of all its details all of which are clearly discerned and properly related and put together.

Under the leadership of his anointed King Christ Jesus, we must march forth unitedly, those from the east united with those from the west; those having the administrative work united with those greater numbers who carry out instructions.

It means conversion or a turning away from sin and from the world which serves sin and acting upon the good news of the gospel and putting oneself on the side of God’s kingdom and its righteousness. Repentance was not to remain the exclusive privilege of the Jews, but in due time God revealed his mind upon this at the time of the conversion of Cornelius to Christianity. Repentance is required of all alike, both Jew's and other nations, before approaching Jehovah God through Jesus Christ. Such repentance must be followed by conversion or a sincere and determined turning away from the sin of this world, because God and this world are at opposites.

Wc, if we love and seek eternal life, might as well reconcile ourselves now to the inevitable, and in faith accommodate ourselves to it now.

It is inevitable that all confession to God with the tongue must be made through his King Jesus Christ.

As a sojourner in a strange land, Abraham held on until he died, when 175 years old. In all that time he was faithful as a witness and prophet of Jehovah God.

But their future offspring had not been on trial in Eden directly, and for them there would be a future judgment possible. This would be possible because of God’s purpose respecting the Seed of his woman. (Geu. 3:15) The Seed would be brought forth from God’s holy organization, and then the Seed would triumph over suffering and death and would finally bruise the Serpent’s head.

<p><span class="font4">To gain eternal life, you must follow up God’s commands aud instructions. In that way you will save yourself; that is, you will work out your own salvation with God’s help through Jesus Christ. When we understand God’s W’ord concerning what the glorious new world holds, we will work, and will work hard, to save ourselves; and there is nothing wrong in doing that. We love ourselves and want to save ourselves. But if, as God’s second commandment lays upon us, we love our neighbor as ourselves, then we will want not only to gain salvation for ourselves but also to aid our neighbor to gain the God-given salvation, because we know that the salvation is for others besides just ourselves. This is the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses today persistently go out into the field bearing the good news of eternal salvation by God’s kingdom. They cannot keep this good news to themselves. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

Now in this postwar period following World War II they have lost no time but have bestirred themselves to greater exertions in God’s service than ever before. The individuals among them, men and women, boys and girls, have called out to one another to awake to their privileges early. Redeem the time during this fleeting time-interval that remains before the world-destruction at Armageddon! The glorious light of God’s kingdom shines upon us from the pages of His Word. He has glorified his remnant with the commission to serve as ambassadors of the established Kingdom. This glorious privilege should not be neglected for any length of time. Early now the urgency of God’s service sends to each of us the rousing call, “Awake, my glory!” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font4"> 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jeremiah’s words being uttered in public right in the holy city of Jerusalem, nay, more, right in the temple precincts, were they not liable to stir up a mob, public commotion, and rioting? That is exactly what they did. (2G:8, 9) Despite all that religious racket, did Jeremiah have a right to say this in public? Did he have just cause or excuse for speaking such things openly, at the capital city? What clears Jeremiah of all libel, blasphemy and sedition in this ease is that Jehovah God himself sent Jeremiah and commanded him to speak thus in His name in the temple courts where the religionists could hear his words. What the Host High God commanded his witness on earth to declare could not be libelous and seditious, for surely God is not libelous and seditious against himself. Jeremiah did not speak with malicious intent to God’s covenant people, but in obedience to him. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/1</span></p>

Do not intentionally provoke strife, turmoil and quarrel; but if controversy and disagreement are stirred up, let it be from the other party, because he objects to our proclaiming the truth of God’s Word. Even the Perfect One, Christ Jesus, ran into controversy, opposition and disturbance because he preached the Kingdom truth. We, his followers, are not above him or better than he and cannot do other than also rouse up opposition and debate because of sharing in the “testimony of Jesus Christ” and proclaiming the truth. The purpose of the gospel is not to stir up strife and controversy. It is the antagonists of the truth that hatefully stir up such. Such is unavoidable in those cases, and we should not stop publishing the Kingdom truth in order to avoid such.

<p><span class="font4">This promise depends upon the Lord God’s power of resurrection for its realization. By the time the blessing of all families of the earth should be due so many of such families should be dead and in graves. How, then, could they all be blessed unless the omnipotent God exercised his power of resurrection at his appointed time? Although foreseeing the need of resurrection, yet also knowing his own miraculous power, Jehovah God made his promise to Abraham of such breadth as to sweep in all families. It was not an impossible and ridiculous boast, but an adequately backed-up promise. Abraham was but a prophetic type of Jehovah. In reality, therefore, it is in Jehovah that all families of those that bless Him will be blessed with eternal life.

<p><span class="font4">The apostles of Christ moved their location from place to place as missionaries and issued organization instructions as these became necessary and were inspired of God by his spirit. Now since A.D. 1914 the Almighty God can operate through a central governing body in one part of the earth as well as in another part, because since 1914, in a Kingdom sense, “the earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” (Ps. 24: 1, A.iS'.U.) Anywhere on his footstool he can locate his visible governing body and use it, because all the earth belongs to him, and is not the property of any political government or of the United Nations. If God wants to change geographical locations still further for his servants, it is within his right and power to do so. He is bound by no traditions of places. Not nationality, nor geographical location, but the existence and presence of consecrated, faithful servants of God determines as regards His governing body. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We must be generous to let others share to an equal degree with us in the spiritual blessings that the Lord God our great Rewarder now has to bestow upon us in His service. Those who think they have earned the Lord’s blessings by long service are liable to think that those with a shorter record of service are not entitled to the same blessings and equal blessings as themselves. Those inclined to envy the mercies and favors that others receive after a short time in God’s service take a bad view of matters, and they cannot see straight on the fundamental principles upon which God’s organization rests and operates. The evil eye, if uncorrected, will certainly cause a worker in God’s vineyard to lose out finally and not be chosen or selected to the Kingdom for which he may have been called long before when his heart was right.

<p><span class="font4">The truth of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty is being denied and fought against now when it must be exercised through his kingdom. Hence the King must ride to the final war of Armageddon for the sake of establishing that truth and the truth of all of God’s written Word. As a man the King was meek and lowly, and now his followers show a like meekness. They are also greatly afflicted, persecuted and opposed in all lands. In support of the meekness exhibited by them in obeying God’s will and carrying on his work of gospel-preaching the King must ride. He must make their service to God prosper despite all opposition. The greatest act of righteousness is the vindicating of Jehovah’s sovereignty and name; and for the sake of bringing about such righteousness in all the universe his King must ride on to victory.

They cannot righteously be held back from the doors of the homes of the people, if God’s will is to be done and He is to be pleased. Governments and worldly authorities cannot, without direct opposition to His express command, ban, proscribe and prohibit them from spreading the Kingdom message all over Christendom and repeatedly preaching it in order to make on some minds an impression deep enough to leave a mark that will shield persons from execution by God’s “six men” at Armageddon.

(Col. 1:13) This does not import any seditious stand toward the kingdoms of the world, nor does it stir us up to any subversive activities against kings and rulers. It means simply that we do not interest ourselves in or participate in political and governmental affairs of this earthly organization. We are, in fact, not in pursuit of any earthly rulership or kingdom. When the resurrected Jesus sent his servants forth to make disciples among all nations, he was no longer in this world, as well as not of it, but was about to ascend to heaven to his Father's right hand.

All these returned to corruption and the dust of the earth. “But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.” (Acts 13 : 37) For such reason Moses and the other prophets were correct in foretelling “that Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim”. (Aets 26:22,23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Also John correctly declared that his message was from “Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead”. (Rev. 1:5) He was the first and the last to rise by God’s direct power without the intervention of any creature. He has the preeminence as to the miracle of the resurrection, and his was the beginning of the “first resurrection”, in which Christians share.—Rev. 20:5,6. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font4"> 4/1</span></p>

He knew it would do the congregation good to rebuke them, and he was courageous enough to do it as a member of the then governing body of the Christian church. (2 Cor. 10:8-11; 11:5-7; 12:20-13:3) Flattering would have done no good to the brethren in their poor spiritual condition, but rebuke would show them the right way. Of course, it might hurt their feelings for a while, but later it would be appreciated and win the favor of the right-minded brethren. The apostle was righteous in reproving his brethren. He did so to heal and build them up, and not to break their heads with discouragement and despair.

We can watch how God by Christ has fulfilled or is in course of fulfilling them, and then can safeguard ourselves from the false dreams and vain visions of the religionists of Christendom. While none of us can produce inspired speech and writings, God has committed his inspired Bible to us and we can govern ourselves by its inspired commandments, teachings and instructions. We can quote and copy the Scriptures of God’s inspired men and can apply them according to the facts. We can observe how God interprets them by Christ Jesus through the events and facts that he causes to appear.

<p><span class="font4">God’s purpose in extending mercy to persons is not that they could continue repeating such sins in intentional selfindulgence and think God’s mercy easily available for relief. Not at all! His mercy is an incentive to righteousness, a spur to an honest effort to live above sin and free from its service. Mercy is given in order to put the consecrated person on his integrity thenceforth, and such integrity he must keep by not returning to the filth and service of sin, like the sow that goes back to wallowing in the mire. The issue of integrity is set before the receiver of God’s loving compassion. He now has the opportunity to vindicate God's dealings with him.

His endurance of reproach and opposition to his own supreme self at the hands of enemies has been with loving-kindness and mercy toward mankind in sin and imperfection. (2 Pet. 3: 9, 15) In justice to himself Jehovah God will not endure this for all time. He will in his wise time, after his purpose has been realized, use his almighty power to bring this wicked reproach and opposition to its fitting end.

It is this, namely, the restoring and the advancing of the worship of his God and Father, Jehovah, throughout all the earth.

He could not do so and at the same time hold his ministerial rank with the Lord God, because the prophecy foretold that the nations and their kings and rulers would be angry and enraged when the Lord God Almighty would take his great power to himself and would begin to reign. They would not bless him and give him thanks for making this move to bring in the new world of righteousness for “men of good will”.

To the end that he may say what is tactful in difficult situations it is well for him to have the words of knowledge and wisdom fitted or firmly fixed upon his lips.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Jas. 5:10, 20th Cent. N. T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the speaking prophets were dealt with the same way, with provings of their constancy to God. They all have shown us what to do under our present test. Seeing that God’s approval of them is recorded in his Word, we can count all of them happy because of holding out under test. (5:11) The Lord’s purpose in the sufferings of all the speaking prophets of Jehovah was the vindication of his name and universal sovereignty. Because of continuous steadfastness, they had part in vindicating him and proving the Devil a liar, and we can become counted among the happy ones by following their example. There must be some to uphold Jehovah’s side with integrity during this century, as those speaking prophets did in ancient centuries, and happy are we to be the ones to do it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God’s Word presents no thought of defeatism, no expectation of frustration, but only hope of sure and final triumph after we have had a hard campaign. The situation before us is like that which faced Israel as they were encamped on the east side of the Jordan, ready to cross over into the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua. All the nations there were greater and mightier than the Israelites and worshiped demon gods. The demons roused up all these devotees of theirs to stout resistance, by leagues of united nations on at least two occasions. But that did not stop the push of the worshipers of Jehovah back there, because He fought for them in order that his worship might be established in the land he promised them. His works in the ancient past in behalf of his worship were written for our sakes today, and we should remember them to strengthen our hearts. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At the yearly memorial celebration the Christian heirs of the Kingdom partake of the bread. They look not upon it as symbolizing Jesus’ fleshly humanity, but discern it to represent “the Lord’s body”, the church, of which they themselves are members, body members under Christ Jesus the Head. (11:27-29) Their partaking of the emblem of the bread is an open confession that they are consecrated, spirit-begotten members of Christ’s “body”, which is the church. By eating the “one bread” they declare their communion or oneness with Christ the Head, to do God’s will as he set the example and to suffer affliction in this world as he did. Symbolically they cat the “bread of affliction”. (Dcut. 16:3) But despite the afflictions and sufferings for God’s kingdom they tenaciously hold on to their Christlike integrity toward God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Study of the Bible is vital, but it must be followed up by confession. We must not neglect teaching the Holy Scriptures to others, which means confession. In our public reading of the Scriptures we can either ourselves read or teach others to read the Bible. By doing what could Timothy in Paul’s day lay hold on salvation from God for himself and at the same time aid others, his neighbors, to share in that common salvation? By doing the public reading of Scripture, by teaching what it meant, by preaching God’s kingdom, by keeping busy in God's work, by using his mouth to make confession. By doing all this Timothy would show love first to God and then love for his neighbor as well as for himself. The way to apply the rule of love, and the way to gain salvation, are just the same for today as then. So follow them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While on earth Jesus’ lips were constantly graced with the message of God's kingdom. From the time of his anointing with the spirit of God he was persistently preaching the Kingdom both publicly and privately in the houses of the people. In order to silence his gracious lips, the human agents of Satan had him killed. By meekly submitting to such death in proof of his loyalty to God’s work and will, he displayed matchless beauty of holiness to his heavenly Father. Hence God blessed him for ever, by resurrecting him from the dead and exalting him to his own right hand, far above all other holy creatures in the universe. Now, as enthroned King, Jesus graces the lips of his faithful remnant on earth with the same message that graced his own lips on earth ; and he supervises this anointed remnant in fulfilling his own prophecy: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God’s organization is an orderly and well-connected arrangement of his devoted and obedient creatures in order that they may work together toward a common end and in harmony with his purpose. It is that they may do so in peace and in oneness, without clash or conflict, but, to the contrary, with efficiency, with dynamic relaxation, and with comfortable state of heart and mind. God’s organization is at one with itself. All its members are at one with its great Organizer, Jehovah God, and at one with their fellow members. His perfect wisdom makes it that way. The organization is Theocratic, because God is the organizer of it and is its top director at all times. It operates Theocratically, because it functions by taking orders from God down through Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Is it a Gospel publisher’s business, unbidden, to tell men what to do in their own homes? When making a first return visit on the interested to start a Bible study, are we Scrip-turally required to say: “Now before we start our study in this book, I should like to ask you, Have you ever committed adultery? Have you ever stolen anything? Ever been in jail for perjury? Ever coveted your neighbor’s wife?” We might just as well do so (and it would be consistent to do so) if later on we let ourselves become disturbed and then interrupt our Bible study because our student indulged in a bad habit. We are not there to try to tell that student on the first night of our visit just how to live.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.—1 Cor. 15:20, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another proof foreshadowing God’s purpose to overpower the “gates of hell” and deliver the dead is his law concerning the spring first-fruits of the grain harvest. (Lev. 23:9-14) The apostle calls notice to this law as showing the performance and the date of the most important resurrection, the first of its kind and the foundation of all future resurrections. Jesus Christ, in harmony with being the first-fruits of those asleep in death, was raised from death on Nisan 10, the very day on which the Jewish high-priest offered the sheaf (or omer) of barley grain to God at the temple in Jerusalem. According to God’s law the offering of the first-fruits was followed by the gathering and eating of the after-fruits. Hence if Jesus is the first-fruits of those asleep in death, it denotes resurrection for such other sleepers afterward at the divinely appointed time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

All these organization members are anointed with the one spirit of God unto service. It is not the individual Christian that makes the choice of a particular gift of the spirit. If it were left to each individual Christian to choose, there would likely be an overweight or preponderance of one kind of gift as against others, leading to an unbalance and to an artificial scarcity of other valuable gifts. It is Jehovah who governs those consecrated to him through Christ, and he determines what particular gifts shall be bestowed by his spirit or active force and upon whom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Jewish nation was cast off, and the faithful remnant that believed God’s prophecies became the small start of his anointed church or ccclesia. The prophecy of Joel 2:28-32 clearly said that the outpouring of His spirit would not be on Jewish flesh alone but upon all that should call upon Jehovah’s name through his Christ. Hence the church of God was foretold to be not only of one-time Jews but also of one-time Gentiles, heathens or pagans. (Acts 2:16-21) From then on the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Jehovah and his Christ were to be united in one assembly, church or ccclesia. The Israelite congregation of old time was called out of l.’gypt because they were the offspring of Abraham, who had been called out of Chaldea. In the same way the Jewish and Christian believers in Jehovah that follow Christ’s footsteps are called out of this world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God has let the imitation-Christian nations exist on down to this day of judgment, because it was for this day that he was reserving them to be punished in destruction in the final end of this world. But, as with Noah and Lot, Jehovah God has faithfully kept his little band of witnesses. He will deliver them out of this crucial period of world temptation and bring them alive through the catastrophic end of this world and over into the everlasting righteous new world to follow. Jehovah now issues his challenge to the nations to come down to the low place of opposition to his kingdom where he will execute judgment on them. (Joel 3: 9-13) They will never leave that place alive. It will spell the end of their world in total destruction. Jehovah will be vindicated by his King by whom he executes judgment upon all opposers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

They will live on to praise him among all that live. But those who for a time drive his worshipers underground in trying to put them out of existence are just as certain to be themselves destroyed: “that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.” (83: 18) The great display of his universal sovereignty draws near. All nations will behold it with terror and will want to go below ground. (Rev. 6: 15-17) The way for any to experience His mercy and favor then is to show mercy and help to hie worshipers when they are forced underground and also when they come up again to sing his praises openly among all nations.

He will also be careful not to divulge matters that are strictly the business of the Lord’s organization and that are confidential to hint or his fellow workmen. He will not disclose these to others as general news for the public.

Faithful Daniel confessed the sin of his people in hope of an early restoration of them to God’s favor. He did not act self-righteous so as not to include himself with the guilty nation of Israel. (Dan. 9: 1-19) In this course he is a faithful example for all the humble ones of God’s remnant and their good-will companions to follow in this time of mercy. He will give that which is good to all who repent and confess and convert to His ways in these perilous times before Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">If Moses was inspired and God disclosed to him the divine will in a specially direct way, Jesus Christ the prophet like him was also inspired and received revelations of the divine will in a direct, personal way. One means of Jesus’ inspiration was the holy spirit of God. It descended upon him with a visible manifestation, like a descending dove, which was seen by a trustworthy eyewitness, John the Baptist. “For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth nqt the spirit by measure.

They stayed put in the city as God’s anointed servants charged with delivering a continuous witness in that city, notwithstanding the objection of the religious leaders and the fierce persecutions from Jewish religionists. They got out and abandoned that territory only when it became necessary to obey Jesus’ prophetic words because its destruction by Roman armies was about to begin. (Luke 21: 20-24) But when they at last got out and left Jerusalem to her dire fate, the work of witness there had really been finished.

For this, Jesus was judged by them as a seditious libeler outside the pale of God’s people and was led out of Jerusalem’s gate to die like an accursed blasphemer.

We will look upon such accusations as an opportunity and reason for us to bear the name of Jehovah and his Christ before all enemies, for a witness against them. We will view our wrongly accused position as an opportunity to share with Jesus Christ the King in vindicating his Father’s name by standing fast for Jehovah’s supremacy and sovereignty, even be it to imprisonment or death permitted at enemy hands. By all legal and Christian ways we will continue to fight for our Godgiven rights and liberty to preach his Word, all of it, offend whom it may.

<p><span class="font4">This does not refer to being ordained to preach or be minister of God. It refers to “the gift”, “the gift of God,” which gift was bestowed upon believers consecrating when the apostles laid their hands upon them. It was the gift of the spirit, whereby miraculous ability was conferred upon those receiving it, so that they could prophesy, or talk with a foreign language, or interpret, or perform cures. Since the death of the apostles the bestowing of gifts of the spirit by them stopped of necessity. (1 Cor. 13:1-8) Hence the practice of laying on of hands would cease with them. Thereafter any laying on of hands by any persons would, at most, be symbolic of appointing someone to a responsible position or work, but not of ordaining that one to be a “minister of God”.

He ought to remember he himself is not important or irreplaceable, but it is the office of service that is important and that must be carried out. It has a relationship close or remote with all other offices or kinds of service in the organization, regardless of how inferior. What makes for unity in the organization is the unselfish concern of all the members for one another, with humility and with the effort to aid another member where he may lack. After all, this is all for the good of the organization as a whole and for its proper appearance before the world. This works out for the glory of God, because it proves his spirit is upon the organization.

According to the principle upon which God now proceeds, we must expect it, face it, and go through with it. God has not spared himself from enduring unpleasant things that he could blot out instantly if the leading issue of universal sovereignty and of creature integrity were not pressing for an eternal answer. Unavoidably everyone who seeks after God and consecrates himself to God’s side of the issue and undertakes to serve him has this world under Satan arrayed in continual opposition to him. Every such one must steel himself to endure that wicked opposition and to bear it as long as this world stands and until it goes down in defeat at Armageddon before God.

Thus far his mercy to men and the forgiving of their sins has resulted in producing many men and women of integrity. Each and every one of these stands forth in justification of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and in condemnation of Satan the Devil as being a false god who lied when he blatantly declared before all the universe that God could not bring forth such persons of unbreakable integrity on earth as long as wickedness was around loose. If it had not been for God’s mercy in not at once killing Adam and Eve for sin but letting them live to produce children, none of our sinful race would have had the chance to develop and demonstrate integrity toward God.

<p><span class="font4">The unjust are the ones that come to the resurrection of judgment, to be “judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works”. (Rev. 20: 12) The ‘things written in the books’ do not mean the records of all their past unjust life and all the evil they have done before dying and descending into the graves. True, such evil lives and things of the present will have a hindering effect on them in the thousand-year judgment day, because they will be the same personalities in the resurrection. But those things are in the past, just as a Christian’s life before accepting Christ and consecrating to God is a thing of the past and Christ’s ransom sacrifice takes care of all that. So the future is what counts for them. Christ’s “ransom for many” opens up the way back to eternal perfect human life for all coming forth in the resurrection of judgment. W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.—Jas. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As servants or slaves of one another in imitation of Jesus, we will encourage all our brethren into that public confession with the mouth that wins divine approval and leads to their salvation. We will not be partial, but will love our neighbors of whatsoever nation, kindred, race and tongue, and we will therefore be moved to share with them the message of salvation which the neighborly love by others has passed on to us ourselves. We are here in this hostile world to help our brethren to win that salvation which is now so near realization in the new world, a world united in worshiping and loving Jehovah God with all the heart, mind, soul and strength. Among those who hope to live together with their faithful fellow creatures in the righteous new world, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font4"> is the time to begin and practice to the limit that “royal law” of love of man to man. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.—Col. 3:14, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God made our bodies that all parts and members of them should naturally care for one another. Just like that it should be with that larger organization, the body of Christ, of whom the anointed Christians are members in particular. All must bear a responsibility toward one another, and this should be borne with love such as Jehovah God had in making the human body. “But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?” (1 John 3: 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> We should have mutual love for one another as members of the Lord’s organization under Christ, mainly because the Lord's commissioned work for the “body of Christ” is concerned, namely, that of proclaiming the Kingdom gospel. Such love is Christ-like. It is a fruit of God’s spirit and is a great unifier and binder within the organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.—Prov. 22: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we press along in the one and only right way, we shall look with generosity upon the poor people in darkness and who hunger for the light of Kingdom truth. Personally we do not have much of material bread to distribute, but we do have an abundance of spiritual food from God’s Word which has been made understandable to our hearts and minds. While such world hunger for truth exists, this is uo time for the envious eye that begrudges God’s “meat in due season” to any people. By copying today Jesus’ bounteous course toward the poor and by imparting to them the bread by which we have been so well fed and nourished, we shall show we do not despise their Maker, Jehovah God, and we shall be certain of His blessing, in addition to any blessings from the poor we serve with food. (28:27) Thus fed, their eyes will be enlightened and will be able to discern God’s kingdom and his King. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Love . . . endures all things.—1 Cor. 13:4,7, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Serving God is, in fact, its own reward. But, in addition to the simple privilege of his work, there is a time for further rewarding us with the long-hoped-for things of his promise, after the completion of God’s “strange work” at this end of the world. At times of weariness we may ask : ‘How shall we stand up and last any longer?’ By loving God with all our heart, mind, soul and strength is how. Our love of him we express by keeping his commandments. Unless it is out of love of God that we endure, our bearing up under burdens and afflictions docs not mean devotion to him and does not have the effect of deepening our love for him. It is for some other cause and does not count with God. But what was not Jesus able to do out of love for God his Father? and what can we his followers not do and endure out of love for God our Father and his? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7 /1~&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To have respect of persons is not good.—Prov. 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Setting the mark on people’s foreheads by means of the message of salvation does not mean we are the ones to judge individuals and decide whether such are worthy of salvation or of execution. We must let the Kingdom message itself do the searching out of those worthy to be marked and willing to submit to marking. By God’s command through Christ Jesus we must call on all the people in our territories, and try not to miss a single intelligent person. We do so in order to avoid acting as judges of anybody. We let all have an opportunity to hear and to decide for themselves. To this end we as Jehovah’s witnesses follow the effective example of Jesus Christ and his apostles by going from house to house to preach to those in the homes as well as preaching publicly. In this way we get in touch with all the people, of all classes, and learn firsthand their attitude and decision. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.—Matt. 19:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Jesus’ words at verse 9, fornication is the only ground recognized by God for divorcing one’s unfaithful mate. Otherwise, no human creature should separate and put apart those who God’s original institution of marriage in Eden decreed should dwell together as one flesh. God does not personally intervene to make human matches and to join together all human marriage couples and thus become responsible if they turn out bad. But by creating woman and mating her with Adam God did show the unity that should apply to all humans that join together in marriage, and that should be recognized. The apostle Paul does not, therefore, encourage separations and does not sanction them, except for the reason that the Lord announced, namely, fornication, (1 Cor. 7:10,11) This dissolves the marriage bond. The dissolution can be legalized by the law of the land. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">It behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God.—Heb. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to continue acceptable as a ransom sacrifice and high priest for mankind, it was absolutely necessary for Jesus Christ to maintain perfect integrity toward God in every point. He is the foretold “Seed of Abraham”, in whom “shall all the nations of the earth be blessed”. As such Seed of Abraham he associates with himself all his devoted followers. Thus through him they spiritually become parts of Abraham’s seed, his brethren. Jesus seeks, first of all, to help them, especially because they are imperfect, sin-infected human creatures. Having been once flesh himself and exposed to all the temptations and trials to which they are exposed, he as high priest can understand their position and can be a merciful high priest for their sakes. Because he kept his integrity, he can help them to do so. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">He that covereth a transgression seeketh [procureth] love; but he that repeateth [or, harpeth</span><span class="font4"> on] </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a matter scparateth very friends.—Prov. 17:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a person loves his brother or sister he will keep quiet about them and so not put the brother or sister in difficulty by making either one an object of open shame. He will not make it hard for them to hold onto friends. He will not strain his own friendship with them by talking about them. If, then, you want to earn the love of another, you will overlook his transgressions or keep silent about them or not make them a subject of common gossip. And if some gossiper pours into your ears a tale about others’ shortcoming, you will show love by not repeating and passing on the tale to others. Neither will you keep on bringing it up or harping upon it before others until you have made them despise others and quit their friendship. To befriend a brother at fault, remember this: “A friend loveth at all times.”—17: 17. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.—Matt. 13: $3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shining now in the kingdom of their Father means letting the light of the message of God’s kingdom shine out to all men of good-will in all nations. Now the “children of the kingdom” must shine because in 1914 Jehovah God set up his kingdom in the heavens by Christ Jesus and the “time of the end” began for this old world. Their faithfully shining down till the final end comes upon this world will determine whether they continue to be “children of the kingdom” and whether they enter at last into the heavenly kingdom. Only by ever exercising the Christian virtues while so shining forth God’s message will they gain entrance into the royal realm above. So says Peter. (2 Pet. 1:10,11) Persecutions and afflictions have come upon them at the hands of the wicked. Still the remnant keep on shining in the kingdom of their Father. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.—John 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Jesus’ anointing with the holy spirit A.D. 29 he became God’s anointed High Priest according to the rank of Melchizedek who had once blessed faithful Abraham. By possessing his own perfect human life the High Priest Christ Jesus was in possession of a holy, acceptable sacrifice that he could offer up to God. It would really take away sins and would provide a righteous standing for sinners that accepted it. Because the sacrifice of himself as a perfect man could do this, he as High Priest needed to offer just one sacrifice, himself, and no more. (Heb. 9:25-28) Manifestly he came for a positive purpose, not for a “ministration of condemnation” like that of Moses when mediating the law covenant with Israel. He came for a work of salvation. All those saved will be delivered to everlasting obedience to God’s sovereignty. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Speak with the enemies in the gate.—Ps. 121: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God has given his worshipers as a heritage now to his King, as his children. They are children given to the all-conquering Fighter for true worship, Christ Jesus, and they are fighters in imitation of him. He now leads right up to the very gates of the enemy strongholds, preparatory to taking complete possession. The seed of Abraham must possess the gates of the enemies. Genesis 22: 17 speaks thus about the Seed. So the offensive against false worship must go on in order that the prisoners may be released for true worship of Jehovah. The order of the day is to push the offensive to the very gates of the enemy. The faithful heirs of life in the new world will do so, receiving courage from the divine promise: “In that day will Jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory, . . . and strength to them that turn baek the battle at the gate.”—Isa. 28: 5, 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

<p><span class="font4">Woe to anyone who thinks he can draw aside and live alone, not recognizing any obligations to his brethren and not caring to contribute anything to their welfare! He will grow cold in the Lord and will lose out in zeal for God’s service and be chilled with worldly fears and grow stiff through spiritual inaction. When we try to keep in touch with our faithful brethren in this unfriendly world, we receive spiritual glow and stimulation. Our brethren help us by pleasant and helpful conversation with us and by discussions of God’s Word and service. Our hearts burn inside us as His Word opens up to our understanding through his Theocratic organization under Christ. As we behold our brethren and feel their moral support while we march along in the road of service, it makes us take new courage, because we behold with what boldness and earnestness they too are serving God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">marriage be held in honour by all, and keep the marriagebed unstained.—Heb. 13:</span><span class="font4"> 4&gt; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah performed the first marriage of man and woman. Out of his own good purpose he made all arrangements for it. It was good in his sight. It brought the man and the woman into the proper relationship with each other. Jehovah God their Creator joined them together to be one flesh. It was not His will that any other creature should try to put them apart, not even death. Very evidently, now, the great marriage-wrecker, Satan the Devil, is trying to bring marriage into disdain, thereby to reproach its Founder, Jehovah God. Undeniably one sinister motive on his part is to infect the true Christians of Jehovah’s organization with a worldly contempt for marriage responsibilities and moral obligations and thus to lead them into this world’s reproachful conduct. For our spiritual good and earthly happiness the time is surely here to think straight upon this serious matter. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By means of Jesus God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.—1 Thess. 4: 14, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the dead are raised from their graves God’s kingdom must be set up and his Judge Christ Jesus must be installed upon the judicial bench. (Rev. 11: 15-19) At that time is when Christ Jesus comes, that is, comes into possession of the Kingdom, and Jehovah sends the rod of his power out of the heavenly capital, Zion, and makes this earth feel its power. The Christians that survive on earth till that wondrous time are not at once taken to heaven to reign with Christ in the Kingdom. Such surviving Christians on earth now have a work to do on earth, namely, preach this gospel of the Kingdom. (Matt. 24: 14) We are now living in the days of the Christian remnant. Hence the dead Christians in the graves must be raised in a spiritual resurrection to heavenly life before ever this surviving remnant on earth finishes its course, dies and is raised to life immortal in heaven. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?—1 Cor. 10:16, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The communion of the body of Christ does not refer to Jesus’ human organism or literal flesh, but refers to the church. So, too, the “blood of Christ” refers here to what the shedding of Jesus’ blood signified, namely, the death that he died, which was of a unique kind. It was a death sacrificially in vindication of God’s kingdom. In numerous scriptures shed blood is employed as a symbol of death. Hence the “communion of the blood of Christ” means the common sharing or common participation in the death such as Christ Jesus died, and in which kind of death all the faithful body-members of Christ must share. By it they “glorify God”, just as the apostle Peter, who partook of the memorial emblems, did.—John 21:19. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah.—Isa. 34:16, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God can create a visible universe, and why can he not also create a book? The question is certainly not one of ability to produce, but one of willingness and purpose to produce such a book. God knows we need it. There are questions concerning God and his purposes toward man that the “book of nature” has never answered and never will. God, who created us with mental powers of understanding, would not leave unsatisfied those of us who want to know him personally for the sake of worshiping and serving him. He would provide the definite answers to our questions by a revelation, a book. There is no need to debate this question, because Jehovah God has provided such a book. He has distinguished the Holy Bible as his book, because he produced its sacred Scriptures by inspiration. Of that sacred Book there is one part that he produced direct without man’s mind or bands. It is the Ten Commandments given at Sinai. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: . . . accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 11:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In receiving his son Isaac from the altar Abraham was acting out a living drama depicting how God would receive his only begotten and beloved Son Jesus from death as a human sacrifice. That Christ Jesus, the seed of God's woman bruised at the heel by the Serpent, was prefigured here by Isaac is indicated by the promise that God gave Abraham immediately afterward in which he said : “And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 22:18) As foreshadowed by Isaac, not only was the promised Seed, which is Christ, to be resurrected from the dead, but also God was to use this Seed in the resurrection of others in order that all the nations might be blessed. Thus God established faith in a resurrection. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Because we love God and the men who are inclined to seek after him, we can gladly put up with many things in order to reach them with the good news of salvation. For preaching God’s Word the foe may bind us. But God’s Word cannot be bound, neither the speaking of it for the salvation of others. Because it was for the direct benefit of God’s devoted people, Paul was glad to undergo sufferings, “even unto bonds.” lie was willing to bear the brunt of the enemy’s assault, if he could spare his brethren the direct suffering or could foil the enemy’s intentions by benefiting the brethren with his Christian ministry. (Col. 1:23-25) Seeing, then, that others stand to profit from our steadfast continuance in God’s service to their eternal salvation, we are under that added urgency to keep on, never quitting until done. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.—Ps. 109:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Exactly how did Jesus declare Jehovah’s name among his brethren and praise Him amidst the congregation? (22:22) Not simply by preaching in Jerusalem’s temple or in the synagogues when his Jewish brethren congregated in such places. He did so by also going to the homes of the common people and from village to village and from city to city. Wherever he could get audiences large or small he proclaimed the truth, whether on a mountainside or at the seashore. He gave God’s kingdom message the widest circulation throughout the land of his brethren, also sending out at least eighty-two of his disciples to do the same thing in the cities, towns aud homes of the Jewish people. In that way his campaign of praise to Jehovah reached a multitude. By Jesus’ method of preaching he was our pattern to follow now.

<p><span class="font4">God is responsible for the difference of services rendered by the many individual members within his Theocratic organization. As Creator of his Theocratic organization he set the members of the organizational body every one according as it pleased him. It is his purpose that they should all co-opcrate with one another in love, like the different members of the one human body. In one respect all members could be alike. That was in love. Love would abide and endure after miraculous gifts passed away at the passing of the church out of its primitive infancy. We must be moved by love of God and of our brethren in order for the service to count in His sight. Various forms of activity and service may pass out as time moves on, but the development of love within us will remain and will hold us true to God and his organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The tongue and the mind are tied closely together. What our vocal organs put forth is practically determined by what is in our mind or heart. To have our speech right and profitable even under agitating conditions, we must in advance fill our hearts with what is pure, true and edifying. Where men's hearts or minds are unclean and defiled, being filled with hypocrisy and religious self-deceits and jealousy, how can their mouths let out anything except what is contained in .their hearts? When they yield to the selfish impulses of their minds and then speak what is therein, it just accentuates and deepens and ingrains in them more firmly the evil inside them. Thus the words of their mouth defile them. They have no control over themselves because of lacking the truthful understanding of God’s Word. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “evil eye”, or the kind of vision that it symbolizes, is selfish and serves a heart that is self-seeking, lacking the pure, sincere love of God and his kingdom. The Kingdom glories in heaven that are promised in God’s Word to the faithful it desires selfishly, and not that this might be to the honor of God and the vindication of his name. Hence at the same time it desires honors, titles, and good things that this world has to offer, in order to please itself. For the sake of these things it is willing to please the world and its great master, Satan. Thus it is willing to make compromises with this world rather than to be decisively clean-cut for the Kingdom. It imagines it ean serve two masters, now serving the Devil's world and lining up with its programs for its own “better, finer order”, and now serving God, to curry God’s favor, for safety’s sake. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

If they had really loved the King, whom men cannot see, they would have loved the message of his kingdom and they would have loved his brethren whom men can see and hear. (1 John 4:20,21) The punishment that is everlasting upon the “goats” is destruction without end, a total cutting off from all life in contradistinction to the eternal life the “sheep” inherit in the new world. This carries as its consequence that the “goats” will not survive the end of this world as Noah and his household survived the watery end of the old world, or as Lot survived the fiery end of Sodom and Gomorrah.

They consider this to be cause for the greatest joy, without anything to equal it in the future. Their present privileges will never be repeated in any future time after Armageddon. They rejoice because of the King’s joy at receiving the kingdom, and entering upon his work of restoring the pure worship of Jehovah God in the earth, and introducing a righteous government. These modern-time </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">virgins</span><span class="font4"> keep themselves pure and clean from this world and commit no spiritual fornication with it.

<p><span class="font4">In the case of a person of good-will of today whom God receives into his service but reserves for life eternal on earth, God puts his holy spirit upon him. He does so, just as he did upon faithful men before Christ, including John the Baptist, respecting whom the angel said: “He shall be filled with the holy spirit, even from his mother’s womb.” (Luke 1:13-15, A.S.V.) Peter, anointed with the spirit, said concerning faithful men before Christ: “Men spake from God, being moved by the holy spirit.” (2 Pet. 1: 21, A.S.T<sup>7</sup>.) In this way the anointed Christian remnant today and their companions, the spirit-filled consecrated ones of good-will, are together “ministers of God”.

<p><span class="font4">The benefit of having the mark in the intellectual forehead is to avoid being sentenced to destruction by Jehovah’s executioners at the end of this world, but to obtain divine mercy and pity through Christ, that, so, one may be counted worthy of life in the righteous new world under God’s kingdom. After Christendom is destroyed without mercy or pity at the final battle fought by Jehovah’s executional forces, those marked ones who, in the natural course of things, may have died before Armageddon’s outbreak will be raised to life on earth. The other marked ones will be spared and preserved alive through the tribulation of Armageddon. Thus all such marked ones together will enter into the privileges of life on the purified earth in the righteous new world.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Lev. 19:3$, Am Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many friendly foreigners or strangers feared the God of Israel as the true, living God and desired to worship and serve him in direct company with the natural Israelites. Under this impulse they threw in their lot with Israel to sojourn among its people, forsaking, in order to do so, the worldly nations worshiping demon gods. They wanted to associate with the nation which the living and true God, Jehovah, had chosen to be a people for his purpose. Therefore Jehovah, when giving Theocratic laws to his elect nation, took notice not merely of the natural Israelites but also of the God-fearing strangers or sojourners. Far from teaching racial hatred and national bigotry, Jehovah by his law showed his chosen people the righteous rule of love, based upon a common worship and service of the same God over all men.

<p><span class="font4">We have passed through two world wars, with violent efforts each time by the Devil to destroy us by bitter persecution. A postwar period now stretches before us, of how long a duration we know not. Because of persisting in our stand for Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ as the hope of all men of good-will, we may be sure further tribulations await us, come a third world war or not. Because the time stretches on indefinitely, with new afflictions certain from godless masses as well as religious masses, should we faint and think this thing is endless and the reward an illusive will-o’-the-wisp? No! That would never vindicate God’s sovereignty or honor his name, and he would not be justified in conferring upon us the prize.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s sworn oath is beyond withdrawal. By it Christ Jesus was made High Priest after the rank of the ancient priest-king Melchizedek. Jesus by his own human sacrifice on earth offered the one and only sacrifice that could count for man and that proved Jesus to be a true high priest. Jehovah God resurrected this High Priest from the dead and granted him access into heaven with his sacrifice, to present it in the very presence of Jehovah God himself for the benefit of humankind. (Heb. 10:12,13; 6:20: 7:1-28) Christ Jesus is High Priest as well as King. It follows as a consequence that now, when he goes into action as King, he is highly concerned with the worship of Jehovah as God and is advancing the knowledge and worship of Him over all the earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

No habit, no formality, no tradition should be permitted to become a hindrance to our getting along together amicably or to a newly interested person’s coming into the Lord’s organization and serving him. We may defeat our purpose if we insist upon another’s measuring up to the standards of elite society, or to the traditional requirements of well-to-do circles. According to heavenly wisdom it is wise for us to remember one thing: Each of us must give an account of himself to God, and not to some man, not to some human organization, and not to the country under whose government we live.

<p><span class="font4">The experience of King Jehoshaphat and his people confirms the rule: “I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (2 Sam. 22: 4) In these days when Armageddon draws near Jehovah’s witnesses may confidently follow the same rule. Doing so, they will not hole up behind walls but will daily march forth calling upon Him by singing his praises publicly and to the people in their homes. Such continuous singing forth the honor of His name and kingdom will lead to their salvation at Armageddon, where they will see their combined foes thrown into confusion and panic and destroyed.

The wise person will pause to look ahead to the evil consequences that may follow speaking untruths and will remember God’s commands against lying, and will not foolishly spread a lie. He will spare himself later regrets and will keep himself inside the love of God. Evil-speakers may be sure their mischiefmaking will boomerang back and strike them smack in the face.

(John 18:36) Be advised, then, ye worldly governments and judges, that the difference between the visible “church of God” and the “kingdom of God” is noteworthy. Only in due time will the faithful ones of the church of God inherit the possession of the Kingdom with Christ in the heavens. This absolutely debars Jehovah’s witnesses from now reigning in the flesh as political kings and priests on earth. We are strictly ambassadors of reconciliation for the heavenly kingdom of God by Christ. Our anointed commission now is to shine forth the message of the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God whom we serve is able to deliver us.—Dan. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Daniel’s three Hebrew fellow captives in Babylon refused to fall down and idolize the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up. Their faithfulness to Jehovah was condemned as an act of sedition which brought the religious decrees of the king into public contempt. The Chaldeans, the then priestly class, were the ones to interpret the Hebrews’ refusal to break God’s commandment against idol-worship as sedition against King Nebuchadnezzar. So Jehovah’s three faithful worshipers were chucked into the fiery furnace for their “crime” of obedience to His universal sovereignty. Thus their innocence was obliged to be proved by fiery ordeal. Jehovah’s sovereign power prevailed over fire, and they were delivered alive from the midst of the blazing furnace, to explode the enemy charge of “Sedition I” This is a prophecy of how he will deliver his faithful witnesses now charged with libel and sedition for worshiping him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Paul correctly states that the unmarried Christian or the Christian keeping virginity is able to be holy to God, that is to say, fully set apart and reserved for God’s direct service, both in body and in spirit. The spirit, or mental inclination, of such single one leans and urges him to the active service of God’s kingdom. So, having no spouse claiming part control of his body, he can follow the spirit or inclination of his mind and heart. He can specialize upon God’s service with concentration of body and mind. Thus he can best look to pleasing only the Lord with the greatest of personal liberty. Likely being a widower who did not choose to lead around a sister, a Christian wife, as Peter and other apostles did, Paul knew whereof he spoke and was competent to give trustworthy advice to the inexperienced.

<p><span class="font4">Why give thanks to Jehovah and sing praises to him now among all peoples and nations? To those who have learned to know him and who have experienced his saving power the answer comes back: “For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.” (57:10) His mercy and truth, his loving-kindness and faithfulness, are all about us, enveloping us, just as the earth’s atmosphere miles deep envelops us. They are higher than what men call mercy, truth and faithfulness. They must be made known by those who have already experienced such divine favors. They must be made known to all nations and people, because only by means of taking advantage of the heavenly mercy, truth and faithfulness will anyone of any nationality ever be able to gain salvation and to praise God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “first resurrection” is now in progress toward the true church. For that reason Christians now surviving on earth have a special blessedness ahead of them. Seeing that Jehovah God the Almighty has assumed his power to reign over all the earth, and his King Christ Jesus now stands up in power on his capital organization, Mount Zion, and the “everlasting gospel” of this kingdom is now being preached in every nation, kindred, people and tongue, something unusual follows. The surviving Christians, on completing their earthly work and dying in their integrity toward God, do not need to sleep on in the graves to await the Lord’s descent and his call to the Christian dead to awake and arise. He has descended. The “dead in Christ” are already risen as first in order.

Thus, figuratively, he restored them to their land or rightful place on earth. Besides mercy, Jehovah God showed his remnant glorious truths about his Kingdom now functioning through Christ. Why? That they might thereafter prove to be faithful servants of integrity to God and to his kingdom of universal sovereignty. That is why Psalm 85 warns all to whom he has restored his peace, “Let them not turn again to folly.” The peace of his approval and blessing will abide with his forgiven and restored remnant only so long as they do not turn back to religion and worldly folly. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

Will anyone suggest how otherwise he did the marking work? In that very same way the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses have obediently been doing the marking work since the Lord came to the temple for inspection and judgment in 1918. All Christendom knows that. To the point of persecuting them, she objects and will keep on objecting to this coming of Jehovah’s witnesses to the doors of her people, just as ancient Jerusalem objected to Ezekiel’s and Jeremiah’s preaching because she had the temple built by Solomon in her midst.

Not all of humankind have turned out to be “vessels of wrath” worthy of destruction. That speaks well for Almighty God in enduring so long. It proves that his endurance has not been in vain but results in covering him at last with unsurpassable glory. His mercy is proved to be not misspent, but works out toward producing (1) a glorious kingdom family in the heavens under Jehovah’s beloved Son Jesus Christ and (2) a recovered and perfected race of human creatures on a paradise earth, all inheritors of everlasting life; a full answer to Satan’s boastful challenge. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

But though Jesus spoke by divine inspiration upon earth, he did not act automatically, without any decision of his own. Jesus had free moral agency the same as any other human on earth, but he submerged his own will into that of his Father. It was not necessary for him to repeat automatically word for word, if he faithfully expressed and lived the sense and inward meaning of God’s commandments and message to him. This fact is illustrated in the accounts of his life by his inspired disciples. Jesus did not personally write a word of the Christian Greek Scriptures, but by his inspired words and his prophetically foretold course of action Jesus provided the material for his disciples to write. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

It may cause the talebearer himself to lose the friendship of the one of whom he gossips or the friendship of the one to whom he gossips.

How the judgment will go in their case will depend upon their works, not their works in the past when Satan and his demons were on the loose, but their works henceforth under the righteous Kingdom. If their works are in harmony with the things written in the books, then judgment rendered toward them will be to justify them to eternal life on a paradise earth. The books are therefore not personalrecord books, but are God’s books setting forth His will concerning mankind during the Kingdom rule. Those things of God’s law are the things worth reading and being published, and by such things which the Judge Jesus Christ publishes for all mankind’s guidance they will be able to learn righteousness that tendeth to everlasting life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

Hence, in the midst of a strife-torn, disquieted world, there should be one visible organization where permanent peace and unity exist, and that should be Jehovah’s organization of His witnesses under the “Prince of Peace”, Christ Jesus. It should stand, and, by God’s grace, it does stand, to the glory of Jehovah God, as a visible, tangible sample of the everlasting peace and unity of the righteous new world which He will early usher in by his kingdom under Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

They had righteousness imputed to them through Christ Jesus, who had gone to heaven to his Father and presented the merit of his human sacrifice. The outpouring of the spirit upon this remnant was a judgment against Satan and his earthly seed because it proved Jesus had been recovered from the heel-wound inflicted by the Serpent and had been raised from the dead and had ascended to his Father's right hand. So now the eventual bruising of the Serpent’s head was a dead certainty. Satan, the prince of this world, had lost out and was condemned as a liar, whereas Jesus had won out for maintaining his integrity to God.

The mental effect is hazy, unclear, unimpressive ; and the staring, by being kept up, is liable to induce drowsy self-hypnotism rather than bestir us to an energetic action in response to sight.

Without a real effort at integrity and uprightness after he was forgiven, David would have been subject to no further mercy and loving-kindness.

<p><span class="font4">The ministerial status of Jehovah’s witnesses has been denied by their enemies who envy them for their position with God. They say the witnesses are peddlers of books, because these preach not only by word of mouth but also by printed page and distribute books and booklets containing printed sermons, which they leave with the people free or at a nominal contribution of money to help in the expense of printing and distributing. They classify the witnesses, therefore, as book peddlers, and try to have courts misapply the commercial laws against them and to require a costly license of them and to tax them and their literature and printing establishments. They purposely overlook the rule set forth by Paul at 1 Corinthians 9:13,14. Jehovah’s witnesses will therefore continue to recognize, confess and contend for their status as &quot;ministers </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of God’’ </span><span class="font4">in the true sense, unabashed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It remains for us to give energy and force to that declaration. How? By now publishing for a witness to all nations this good news about the kingdom of this one King of Jehovah’s appointment. The present-day “virgins” who are companions of the King’s bride will do that very thing in company with the faithful remnant of his bride class. These virgin companions from among all peoples will inherit everlasting life under his government. In what generations of children they bring forth under the Kingdom according to the divine mandate issued anew, they can make the name of their King to be remembered while they fulfill their duties as parental instructors. They will be a blessed part of those peoples who live as his happy subjects and who “give thee thanks for ever and ever”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fervent in spirit: serving the Lord.—Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We ourselves are whole-souled in our devotion to Jehovah God and his organization. We speak of it and serve it with an enthusiasm that is contagious and that takes hold of our brethren and warms them up to liveliness in the Lord’s service. It is no dying or almost cooled-offi devotion, but is fired by God’s spirit or active force which is operating within us as we try to serve the Lord God. Serving the Lord, rather than man or devil, is the most important thing that any creature could do on this earth. Serve him, knowing that serving him by showing forth his praises and recommending his kingdom to others guarantees to each servant of God his personal salvation. Service in this reconstruction time means expanding the pure worship of him to all parts of the earth, that his name and Theocratic Government may be known and be great among our neighbors of good-will. Such service glorifies Him and brings to us eternal life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">With the heart man believeth unto righteousness: and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.—Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible is the only Book that puts down in writing the proper worship of the living and true God. According to that sacred Word his worship is not a silent one out of sight of the unbelieving world, but is a very vocal and open service and activity. It puts very prominently the praising of God, not just in silent prayer as in one’s private closet or chamber, but out where others may hear. The Bible says much in regard to the worshiper’s praising Jehovah God in the presence and hearing of others, yes, of multitudes. This praise is a requirement in the worshiper’s life, because it is an open confession of the worshiper’s faith and devotion to the Lord God. On such account this praise guarantees deliverance and salvation into the new world of everlasting life.—14:11. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A tody hast thou prepared me: .. . Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.—Heb. 10:5-1,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus consecrated himself to Jehovah God at the time of being baptized in the Jordan, he referred thus to his human body. By offering this body once for all he paved the way for the sanctification of those who become his spiritual brethren, members of his church. Jesus’ sacrifice was typified or symbolized by the sin-atoning animals sacrificed on the Jewish annual atonement day. (Heb. 13: 11-13) Like such animal victims whose bodies were cremated outside the camp of the Israelites, so Jesus in the days of his flesh on earth suffered reproaches unto death as if he was an offensive sinner outside of God’s people. Let us for whom he died bear reproach with him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. —Heb. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those of the church do not have their natural descent recorded upon the birth registries at Jerusalem or other cities in the onetime Holy Land of Palestine, but as “new creatures” in Christ they trace their begettal to God in heaven. They have been begotten by Him by means of his Word and holy spirit to be his spiritual children. Jesus Christ the firstborn Son of God is their spiritual brother who is not ashamed to confess them as his brethren. With him they are invited to the chief position in God’s universal organization, namely, the heavenly kingdom; and this is the position of His firstborn ones. Hence they have come into what the apostle calls the “church of the first-born, which are written in heaven”. (Heb. 12:23) In the midst of these it is that their Head, Jesus Christ, sings praise to Jehovah God by continually enlightening them on God’s virtues and purposes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The headquarters from which issues the Kingdom gospel is heavenly and is above all political parties and ideologies, and its textbook of teaching is God’s holy Word, the Bible. It makes subjects for Jehovah’s heavenly King,- but does so by no carnal weapons or violent terrorism or strong-arm squads of the political state; it does it solely by the power of the love of God which is expressed in the message of his kingdom. No one on earth is exempted from the obligation to serve and worship Jehovah and to yield homage and obedience to his King. To take refuge in him persons tied in with the world conspiracy of political, commercial and religious rulers should break clean away from it. To avoid perishing with it at the battle of Armageddon they must now seek heavenly wisdom and instruction to serve God and his Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite.—Ezek. 9: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God sends the anointed remnant out to do his work, while he holds back the antitypical six executioners with battle-axes till his due time at Armageddon, The doing of this educational marking-work is for the salvation of the anointed remnant to eternal life in the heavens as well as for the salvation of those marked for earthly salvation, because it is solely by obedience to their commission from God to do this work </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font4"> that they follow their Leader, the Lamb of God, whithersoever he leads, and thus prove worthy of life with him in his heavenly kingdom. The rule is: “In doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.” (1 Tim. 4:16) The anointed remnant cannot be self-centered and concerned just about their own salvation. Like the man in linen, they must be interested in the salvation of others, exceptionally so in this time of world crisis. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The merciful . . . shall obtain mercy.—Matt. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even after God shows us mercy and makes us his consecrated people, we still have our human weaknesses and imperfections of body and mind, and it is necessary for him to be merciful toward us. If now God has mercy upon us, we ought also to be very merciful with one another. For who are we to withhold mercy from anyone to whom Jehovah God shows mercy through Christ Jesus? Also, God is tolerant toward the wickedness of those willful sinners who are reserved to destruction in his due time. Ought we not, then, to be tolerant toward those of the consecrated people of God in their habits, customs and imperfections, hoping for them to come to better understanding of matters after further instruction? To abide in God’s mercy, we must cultivate his disposition and must copy him by showing mercy to others. He forgives the sins of those who consecrate with faith in the ransom sacrifice. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The first Christians were dedicated to Jehovah God for the sake of doing the one divine will, and for that reason they were </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God's</span><span class="font4"> organization in which he operated by the power of his holy spirit. They were the visible part of his universal organization, and their invisible Head was the glorified Christ Jesus. In like manner today, we become members of God’s organized people on earth by consecrating ourselves to Him through Christ Jesus. Having-consecrated to God to be His and to do His will, we must associate ourselves with the others of his people and must join with them in doing the divine will, finding our place within his organization and carrying out our work in that place. By consecrating ourselves, to whom else do we belong but to Him? If we are thus consecrated to do His will unitedly, whose organization could we be other than His Theocratic organization? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I prove myself at all points a true minister of God, by my great endurance.—2 Cor. 6: 4, Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All those consecrated to God through Christ and on whom God has put his spirit are “ministers of God”, both those of the anointed remnant and those of the far greater number of persons of good-will. In fact, the unincorporated society of Jehovah’s consecrated witnesses all over the earth is a Society of ordained ministers of God. If all of them are gospel ministers and there is no clergy class and laity class among them, then where is the congregation of each such ordained minister of the gospel? All persons of hearing ears to whom they are sent to preach the gospel of good news of God’s established kingdom are the congregation of this society of ordained ministers of God. It is a congregation, not just to preach to, but to make ministers of God out of, a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">great multitude</span><span class="font4"> of them, all praising God and his King, and serving God day and night at his temple. —Rev. 7:9-15. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?—1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a difficult thing for members of the household of God to remain righteous in Christ and gain everlasting salvation. They will scarcely or with difficulty be finally saved, because it is a narrow way in which the Christians must walk through the world. Those professed Christians who grow careless or loose and then become ungodly and sinful because of disobedience to the gospel can hardly be expected to keep their integrity to God and win a favorable decision from him as Judge and be saved to eternal life. They will appear on the condemned side because of not having kept integrity. Since God’s house, his church, comes under judgment first it is such a serious matter for all the members thereof, and none can afford to fall back into disobedience and sin. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged.—Rev. 20:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The death that delivers up the dead in it is death that Adam brought upon all mankind by his willful sin in Eden before any of his offspring were born. (Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor. 15:21) The multitude of persons of good-will today living who will survive the world’s end in the battle of Armageddon are plainly here meant or included. Death traceable to Adam gives them up because Jesus, who has the keys of death and of hell, tasted death for them and relieves them now of any need to descend into death and the grave because of being offspring of Adam. Hell delivers up “the dead” which were in it, because hell denotes the unconscious state of death in the grave. It means “the hidden place”, or “unseen place”, such as a covered pit or filled-in grave, and is thus associated with the earth. Those sleeping in the dust of the dry ground are restored to conscious existence on earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are obliged to imitate Jesus’ example in always looking to God for guidance and instruction. We are therefore restrained from turning and looking to the many religious organizations about us for enlightenment and teaching. We must keep watch on Jehovah’s instructions through his unfolding Word and his Theocratic organization. We must be just like servants attentively watching the motion of their master’s hand in order to discern the indication of his will and we dare never tire of doing this. As we obey what he indicates to be his will by his hand of power, we will not care for scorn and contempt that Christendom and other religionists heap upon us because we obey God rather than men.

<p><span class="font4">An Amer. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the Christians were, to start with, Jews and nonJews, slavemen and free, male and female, they have all been imbued or saturated with this one spirit, because they are a unitary organization under one Head. Difference and variety of service do not divide them, but the one spirit binds them together. All services are for the benefit of all those of the organization, and for the carrying out of the one over-all purpose of the organization, namely, the service commission which was put upon Jesus, the Head of the organization, when he was anointed with God’s spirit, namely: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.”—Isa. 61:1, Am. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Stan.

The active service of God in which you endeavor to justify God (not yourself) before others is your biggest relief and comfort under the circumstances, to get your mind off yourself and to make you see that other things of personal concern do not matter. Remember that Job was reproved for trying to justify himself against slander rather than to justify God first. However, despite the sharp accusations of hypocritical friends Job did not misuse his lips to curse God and thus break his integrity by bitter lips. (Job 2:10) He did not quit Jehovah’s organization because of the cutting speeches of his friends who claimed to be speaking for God. The merciful end that God gave Job for holding on proves Proverbs 19: 1: “Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The apostle Paul was not the one to seek for an early release from his duties as a minister of God’s Word because it meant hard work and trialsome experiences. He did not quit the ministry demanding a pension on which to retire from activity, because of having served over a term of years or having reached a certain age. Instead of looking for early retirement, to lean back in ease upon his past record, he paid his own way to keep going in the blessed ministry of God’s Word. Despite the burdens of the work, he prized it so much that he tried not to bring any reproach or blame upon this ministry as if it were a work for selfish interests, and so he did not burden the Christian congregations financially. Anything to carry on in God’s service and to make his service impressive for good effect upon people’s minds! this w<sup>T</sup>as the apostle’s motive. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

All are His </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ministers. </span><span class="font4">So as to assist all these ministers, the various servants appointed in the organization were assigned to their respective places and duties. They were chosen because they had a commendatory record of service down till then, and so a little more work with special responsibilities was piled upon them. They were assigned their places in order to supply the needs of God’s ministers. It was not that they might brag and boast themselves, but they were put in office to wait on their fellow ministers. If now they love their brethren, their nearest neighbors, as they do themselves, they will wait on them as much as they wait on themselves. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Because of his faith, zeal and earnest devotion Paul was given the gracious gift of an apostleship. By a life of singleness he applied himself to his duties as apostle, so that he came not one whit behind the eminent ones of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. He kept single, not in his own strength, but by the power of faith and divine grace which he talks of as his own special gift from God. But if every Christian does not have such a gift by the strength of which he can stay single in his service to God, the married Christian also receives a gift from God whereby he too may serve the Lord God in conjunction with his married life. Hence the married ones need not be discouraged, but should strive to live up to the measure of God’s favor to them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The various methods of quoting and referring to the words of the prophets were all done under guidance and impulse of the spirit of God. Consequently the writings of the disciples of Christ are as much God-breathed as the Hebrew Scriptures. The several methods used do not put contradiction in between the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures, but combine to make the ancient Scriptures clear and to show how they applied and were fulfilled. The Christian writers, under inspiration of the spirit, served as commentators upon the ancient pre-Christian Scriptures and were used to illustrate and establish and amplify their truthfulness. Their writings were all part of the fulfillment of Joel </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font4">:28, 29 quoted by Peter.

<p><span class="font4">Satan’s purpose in causing witnesses of Jehovah to be accused of libel and seditious conspiracy against a religion-controlled political state is to get them out of the way, to prevent their giving further testimony to God’s purposes. He turns it into a political matter, to involve them with the state. He considers their faithful preaching and allegiance to the Most High God as libel and sedition against him and his wicked world. One method he has often used is this: He has them accused of seditious designs, and then, supposedly to prevent such from breaking forth into overt acts, he oppresses them by taking away all freedom and liberties, imprisoning them or even killing them.

Ours is a constructive work in obedience to God, and not a destructive work of personal vengeance against our persecutors. Were we to take matters into our own hands and resort to destructive force and violence, we would be forsaking our refuge in God.

<p><span class="font4">Adam’s offspring can die only once because of what he disobediently did in Eden, in offense against God. It is only once that men can be affected to death by what Adam did, because they all descended from him as a dying sinner, under divine condemnation. When men were born as his offspring it unavoidably awaited them to die or to exist under the inherited condemnation of death. But after men, Adam’s offspring, are put on judgment before God, then Adam will not be responsible for whether they gain eternal life or suffer eternal destruction, “the second death.” Why? Because, during the period of judgment, the divinely stated rule applies: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Christ Jesus bore the sins of only those under death inherited from disobedient Adam. Hence Jesus died only once, and that once for all. If any die after judgment, he will not redeem them again. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

Christendom has existed for more than sixteen centuries but to date has failed to produce such a kind of Christian nation. But God’s purpose has not failed, for she is not His organization for producing his holy nation.

<p><span class="font4">The resurrections by which the women received their dead were typical, foreshadowing greater ones coming. But those dead ones brought back were still unredeemed by Christ and subject to the condemnation of death inherited from Adam. Hence they were inescapably due to grow older in their imperfections and to return to the death state. The “better resurrection” of the faithful ancients will be superior in that it will be performed by Jesus Christ who died and rose from the dead that he might lay the basis for mankind’s resurrection. He will be reigning as King, and this resurrection will open to them the way to eternal life on earth under his kingdom. By obeying it they may have the condemnation of sin completely removed and be justified to everlasting life in the new world. Also due to past integrity to God till death they are just so much more advantaged over the rest of mankind. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A soft tongue breaketh the bone.—Prop. 25:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unbelievable as it may sound to the inexperienced, a soft or gentle answer in return for grievous words can break through the hard front of a person that is sincere in his opposition because he misunderstands or is misinformed. Our tongue does well, then, to keep soft, not with flatteries, but with gentle, mild and friendly responses. Our forbearing from giving like for like, while it may be difficult for us under the circumstances, will be so disarming to the opposer that he will rarely know how to handle it. He is more than likely to be pacified. He may be as hard as a jawbone, but his tough outer covering is weakened or may be broken. When he is pacified or softened in his attitude, we can the better get him to listen to what we have to say and can have it stick with him, to work on his mind. That is good, for we go out, not to stir up strife, but to make an impression. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Daughters of kings are said to be among the honorable women dear to Jehovah’s King. Many Hebrew manuscripts say these kings’ daughters were among his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">female servants.</span><span class="font4"> Their being royal ladies means they are an honor to the Bridegroom-King. Being devoted to his service also, they seem to picture in the modern-day scene the multitude of persons of good-will who consecrate themselves to God through Christ and who then align themselves with the remnant of his bridal company to honor and serve him. The “queen” gleaming in garments inwrought with most precious gold from Ophir and standing at the King’s right hand of favor pictures the church herself in complete number of members. Those of the remnant yet on earth are needed to make up her completeness by proving to be faithful to the Bridegroom to the death and then being resurrected to life with him in God’s presence. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christ set us free.—Cal. 5:1, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By reason of linking ourselves up with God’s organization we have come under certain responsibilities. We have now been appointed to a specific place in connection with the organization. Thereby certain obligations fall upon us and we are called upon to render certain tasks and duties which we must faithfully perform in order to gain divine approval. But no man or creature forced us to take this step of consecration. We took it willingly, of our own free accord, out of love to God. Reasonably we did not do so to become slaves and bondservants of any selfish ereature, for him to make unrighteous gain from us. We have become slaves and servants of the great Liberator, Jehovah God. Through Christ he bestows upon us the full freedom to act in works of righteousness and goodness. That is the only freedom we may enjoy eternally with benefit to ourselves and others. His organization is one of free creatures. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W Pi/I</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is no limit set for us as to the number we mark. Christ Jesus the Good Shepherd is gathering his “other sheep” into his fold of safety and security. The number of these marked </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sheep</span><span class="font4"> is predicted to become a numberless multitude. We are therefore authorized to keep on working to mark as many as we can. We cannot of ourselves know beforehand what number they will be at length, but we can keep on numbering them as we go along, in order to note the increase and to rejoice at it because of God’s blessings upon our efforts. We can never stop at any certain number and say the work is finished, because the final number is not foreknown or foretold to us. As long as there is time to work before Jehovah sends his executioners into action to start the slaughter work of Armageddou, we are obliged to keep on working in hope of an increase in the number of marked ones. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Many members, yet but one body.—1 Cor. 12:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christ company under Jesus the Head is like the human body and is therefore a united organization. It must stay closely bound together and at peace with itself, so as to get the benefit of all the varied services of all its members. Differences of services rendered by the many members do not mean the organization is not one body under Jesus the Head; no more than the different performances by the different members of the human organism make it a disunited, shapeless, unidentifiable, inharmonious collection of different things. Likewise with the organization of God’s anointed Christians under their Head Jesus; they are members many in number and with a variety of service and activity, but they have all been made to drink of one spirit, namely, the one holy active force that descends from the Power Plant, Jehovah God, and through their one capital member, Jesus Christ. They have all been imbued or saturated with one spirit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Showing that Christians have been translated into the kingdom of God’s dear Son is the fact that they are called “the children of the kingdom”. (Matt. 13:38) In no text are they spoken of as children of the church. Jesus Christ is not the child of the church of God, but is the One whom God uses to build the church upon himself as the “Rock”, Christ, the Son of the living God. For that reason the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font4"> that gives birth to the man-child, namely, to Christ Jesus in the capacity of the reigning King, can not be the church, the virgin “bride” of Christ.

<p><span class="font4">There is secret strength in our knowing for whom we are privileged to undergo hardship and persecution. Anything undergone for the sake of honoring God’s name and upholding his cause is a reason for a joy such as no man can take away from us. This explains why the apostles, after being beaten at the behest of the Jewish Sanhedrin for bearing witness to God in Jesus’ name, “departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.” This rejoicing counteracted the sting and shame of the beating and made them strong to keep up the ministry, so that “daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ”.—Acts 5:40-42. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.—Matt. 25:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The resurrecting of the dead Christian servants and uniting them with him was an expression of judgment toward them, a judgment of approval. They were judged worthy and were raised to eternal life in inseparable union with Christ Jesus in the heavens. They have risen first; but the remnant of His servants yet alive in the flesh must continue faithful until death before they can join in that “first resurrection” and appear before him face to face. They must keep on using the talents of precious Kingdom service diligently in order that Jehovah God may bless it with increase to the approval of their Judge Jesus Christ. This remnant found alive on earth from and after his coming to the temple in 1918 are brought together as a united, co-operative servant-body under him their Head, and accordingly they are likened to a composite servant that is faithful and discreet.—24:45. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see. —Luke 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus so said to his disciples who had just come in from a campaign of field service preaching the kingdom of God. Jesus’ words are more true in our case now in this twentieth century. We see what kings and prophets, yes, what even Jesus’ early disciples, did not behold. The eyes of us today are far more blessed than even theirs, because we see Jehovah’s royal Government by his Christ now fully established in the heavens forevermore. We are rejoicing over the spiritual light that is now shining due to the inauguration of God’s kingdom. (Prov. 15:30) Christendom, in blindness, cannot understand or perceive this light of today and does not rejoice at it. But the anointed remnant of heirs of the heavenly kingdom do so. They are today required to have the visual powers to take in the light and to actively serve God in it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Accordingly, it is not our main business to argue on native customs and actions of persons of various nationalities and races. It is foolish and time-wasting to be diverted from the main channel for thought, the lofty theme of the Kingdom. We should not let national customs or local habits or racial peculiarities interfere with our preaching of the gospel to interested, inquiring persons. When accepting invitations to meal as Jesus often did, we do not go to the homes to talk about the cooking or the origin of the foodstuffs. We go there primarily to talk about the Kingdom, and that is what we ought to do while there. We then do not miss the point of our visit. We permit no interferences with preaching the gospel by such side issues any more than by some visitor who drops in and intentionally or unintentionally tries to break up the home gathering for the Bible study. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 9:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having now been lifted up from the gates of death from enemy hands, Jehovah’s witnesses must ever thereafter show forth all the praise of their Savior publicly, openly. More so is this obligation true since World War II, for never were they more near entering into death and extinction by God’s enemies. The only reason for now being alive, their only purpose in living, is to praise Him. Now the restoration, reconstruction and expansion of the worship of Jehovah must be effected in the earth, to undo the destructive work of the Devil’s organization. It is the time for persons of good will out from all the nations and peoples of this world to learn to know Jehovah and to serve him, before His battle of Armageddon strikes the nations and kingdoms. Jehovah’s witnesses are the people that were to be created for this time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Women can be “ministers of God”, even though Paul gave out the organization instructions: “I suffer not a woman to teach,” and, “Let your women keep silence in the churches.” (1 Tim. 2:11,12; 1 Cor. 14:33-35) That set of instructions applied to women as teachers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">within</span><span class="font4"> the organized congregation of consecrated believers. Nevertheless, the apostle demonstrated that women can be gospel ministers and ministers of God. He used concerning Phebe the same expression meaning minister as he used concerning himself, Timothy, and Christ Jesus. Phebe’s ministry as a minister of God included more than such helpful items as doing washing, laundering, preparing meals, etc., for the male ministers of God. It included giving verbal witness concerning God’s kingdom to those outside the church. “Your daughters shall prophesy.”—Joel 2: 28. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We Christian survivors hear the loud summons and the archangel’s call and the sound of this last trumpet. How? Through the fulfilled and revealed Word of God and with the hearing of faith in that Word. Because we thus hear, we obey the Lord’s Word detailing to us what the surviving Christians must do at this “time of the end”. With eyes of faith we see that the Lord Jesus Christ has descended by turning his attention downward to this earth as the scene of action and then proceeding to order and direct the things to be done here at this earth. We discern his descent in the light of the prophecies which are going into fulfillment. He is at the opened temple of God in heaven to judge, and in view of the anger of the nations he prepares to “destroy them that destroy the earth” at the final war of Armageddon.—Rev. 11:15-19. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

We face more perfected, combined opposition from all the demoncontrolled enemies of Christ the King; and the increase of his Kingdom interests on earth will come only by our activity. Our best defense against the mounting opposition is to keep up our offensive and not go into stabilized trench warfare on the defensive. As we press forward out into the open in a steady advance upon the religious foes, we need have no fear that our ranks will be mowed down by the enemy’s direct, concentrated fire. Our courage and fearlessness in doing so will be a token to them of the certainty of their impending destruction and will smite fear into them. But this united fearless pushing of God’s work will be to us a strengthening sign of our approaching salvation and deliverance from God.—Phil. 1: 27, 28.

<p><span class="font4">By being quitters we do not help ourselves or anybody else to salvation. By continuing on, regardless of what there is to face and bear, we keep ourselves constantly in line for salvation and we can directly help others unselfishly to salvation and we can be a forceful example of strength to them to that end. The admonition of the apostle we will follow: “Stick to your work.” (4: 16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font4"> We are in this work to win.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.—Prov. 21:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What shall a servant of God do when he finds himself being slandered, or that backbiting is going on about him? Whatever his emotions, it is a time for great self-control against ill-considered action or mental conclusions. Because some go contrary to the declared standard of God’s organization, it would be wrong to take it out on his organization by forsaking it. Apart from it there is only one other organization to which to go, namely, this world, which is Satan’s organization. (John 6 : 66-69) The faithful will hold on, waiting for time to straighten all things out. The speech or conduct of some does not alter the truth and the righteous service of the Kingdom that God has committed to his Theocratic organization. So keep your understanding of your relationship to God by consecration. Do not quit his organization. Satan would like to have you do so, to your everlasting death. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As for what they did ignorantly before coming into the truth and consecrating, that was covered by the blood of Jesus Christ and thenceforth they must follow God’s law. His servant Paul not alone showed how marvelous God’s mercy is. There was another powerful reason for him to call attention to the fact that the onetime fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, covetous, drunkards, etc., were now washed, sanctified, justified and given the Lord’s spirit. What was this hard-hitting reason? It was this, that they should not return to such things and try to impose upon God’s forbearance and merciful goodness. If they did, then they would be fully responsible fornicators, idolaters, sensual effeminates, sodomites, etc., not excusable for ignorance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

This is the light that you, if you are a Christian, are commanded to let shine. Doing so means educational work, a work of enlightening the bedarkened minds of the common people. It is a work that is slow, painstaking and requiring patience and endurance, but it is a good work, the best that could now be done. Mere mental belief with your heart is not sufficient, but is merely the start. Thereafter you, with your enlightened mental belief, must work to let your mental light from God’s Word become known to your neighbors who are in the dark. Then they will see the good you do.

<p><span class="font4">By the Lord Jesus’ own blood the “little flock” of his followers are now declared to be purchased by the presentation of the value or merit of his blood to God in heaven. His lifeblood has conciliatory power, that is, power to bring us into friendly relations with God. (Eph. 2:13) Jesus laid down his earthly life painfully, on a tree of torture, under great reproaches as though he was a transgressor against Jehovah God. But by exercising faith in his blood or sacrificed life the believer has its redeeming power applied to him. He is bought back from the power and effects of sin and is sanctified or cleansed from sin. He is brought into peaceful and friendly relations with God. Thus Jesus’ earthly life laid down makes valid a new covenant by means of which God takes out from all nations a redeemed “people for his name”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

It symbolizes God’s unerasable records of those judged worthy of life eternal on the perfected earth of the New World of righteousness. No records will be preserved of those who are destroyed. (Prov. 10: 7) To get one’s name written in that book of life will depend upon one’s works, whether they are in fulfillment of God’s will and approved by his Judge and King. The Judge’s writing in the book of life of all the names of those judged worthy of eternal life in the new world will take place at the finish of the thousand-year judgment-day. At that time all on earth will be subjected to a final, determinative test of their integrity and indestructible faithfulness to the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “evil eye” is so double in vision or viewpoint that it cannot see that a partial devotion and partial service is pleasing to neither of the two great masters, Jehovah God and Satan the Devil. Each demands the whole or nothing. Such a person with a divided heart has a divided, selfish, envious vision. He can not with any clearness see the requirements as to the kingdom of God or life in the righteous new world now close at hand. With a blurred, compromising vision he is in the dark on these things. He gropes about, now on this side, now on that, and gets nowhere on the path of light, but stumbles on down the broad road that leads to destruction. He may think he is in the light, but what he thinks is light is actual darkness, and, because of his wrong, selfish opinion, “how great is that darkness!”—Matt. 6:23. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

The latter way, it seems, was true of them. This does not mean they understood all the visions they described, even when left to a choice of their own words. But to the extent that they were left to their own words of description and expression, they were not mere automatons or robots, but had the divine guidance in order to express truthfully the things showed to them. But that they did not understand the meaning of all they saw, heard and wrote down is certain. Their visions were, of course, inspired by God’s spirit to reveal to them his will and purposes.

Actually this is the wholesome fragrance of the knowledge of God. Christ Jesus at the temple now sheds this knowledge upon the faithful remnant, and these in turn have the pleasure of spreading the sweet perfume of this knowledge of God and his kingdom to the multitude of persons of goodwill. Like Paul we can say: “Thank God! he always leads me in his triumphal train, through Christ, and spreads the perfume of knowledge of him everywhere through me as his censerbearer.

Where there is interdependence of the members of an organization upon one another, there must be unity. Why? In order to work together for the benefit of the whole organization and all its members. Hence, not only should the organization of Jehovah’s people throughout the earth take to heart this illustration drawn by the apostle, but each local company and unit of His organized people should apply the illustration to itself. It is needful for the same principle of unit}; to govern all Branches of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.

He dealt that way in the days of his typical organization of Israel, and that was a shadow of good things to come, to show how he would treat with his consecrated people in these days since Jesus, the glorified Head of His Theocratic organization, has come. Through his organization under Christ Jesus, God reaches down to give the uplifting hand to those of his organized people who unwillingly fall. Because he works through his organization, how can he help a fallen one up if that one pushes his organization aside, to go alone independently? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It has always served the Devil well, and especially the religious part of his world, to trump up charges of sedition and libel against peace-loving witnesses of Jehovah who in obedience to Him go about in peace preaching the good news of His kingdom by Christ and who try to educate the people in the pure truths of the Bible, free from religious error. The purpose is to stir up the arm of the law to take action and to wield the sword of the state and cut us off and destroy our testimony. This is done that the people may not get the freedom-giving truth. But they will never overthrow this work. This witness work is of God, being commanded by him and started by him through his Son Jesus Christ. Therefore it will never come to nought. It is on the irresistible march to Jehovah’s universal victory at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.—Gal. 3:</span><span class="font4"> 2.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The law covenant was a schoolmaster to point Jews to Christ the Messiah. Along with having it they could still trust in the Abrahamic covenant of 430 years earlier. They could still hope in the promised Seed of Abraham, desiring his coming that they might get the blessing that would relieve them of the divine condemnation through the law. The condemnation or curse of the law was not something that could not be lifted from faithful-hearted ones, not a curse to a destruction from which there was no escape or release. Had the condemnation been something which could not be changed by suitable means, then the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant would have been of no benefit to Jews. But God’s.promise said that in Abraham and his seed, namely, in Jehovah God and His Seed of his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font4"> Jesus Christ, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Air,</span><span class="font4"> families and nations would be blessed.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Such an high priest became us.—Heb. t: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s providing of Jesus Christ was a mercy far exceeding that revealed in appointing the Jewish high priest, because Jesus was and is God’s only begotten Son. The fact that Jesus as a man was above sin and untainted with it did not make him haughty and unfeeling toward sinful mankind. His very becoming a man and answering God’s call to the Melchizedekian order of priesthood spelled mercy toward human sinners, because his being high priest required sacrifice and, in this case, that sacrifice must be his very own self. This made him the most suitable person for high priest, and particularly so since he has been raised up as an immortal spirit out of his sacrificial death as a man. He was thus granted access into the heavenly presence of God, where he can act as high priest of God without interruption in behalf of earthly sinners, a high priest forever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W k/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">David checked himself by remembering his own imperfection. He showed himself willing to put up with reproach and shame at the lips of the wicked reviler, because God was permitting it for a test of David’s integrity. Anxious to keep from slipping into sin, he muzzled his mouth, not even speaking what seemed good. Within himself he spoke, but it was to God in prayer, and he confessed to being an imperfect creature subject to the control and disposition of his great Creator, Jehovah. So looking at matters, David did not charge God foolishly for letting him experience reproach on the part of the wicked enemy. The big thing that David wanted was not to be himself a reproach to God, and he grieved that others, the enemies, should cast reproach upon God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In apostolic times the churches were not divided and opposed to one another according to the politics of the nations of this world; and there were no national churches. Paul decried Christians’ becoming divided over following different prominent servants in the church, such as himself, or Peter Cephas, or Apollos. How much more is it to be decried when any attempt to follow national political leaders and political standards which are not of God and Christ but are of this enemy world? The names of churches given in the Bible indicated merely where the various churches or congregations were located. But the same governing body of Jesus’ apostles and their authorized associates ministered to all these churches, whether in Europe, Asia or Africa, and they issued the same organization instructions for them all. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding the wickedness all round about them and against them, Jehovah God prepares certain human vessels to everlasting glory and defeats the purpose intended by the wickedness of his great opposer, Satan the Devil, and all his fellow opposers. These particular human vessels that are under preparation for the riches of divine glory are Jehovah's people, “the children of the living God.” He bestows mercy upon them to make them his people, his children. The glory to which he brings them forth as his children is the glory of his heavenly kingdom under his “King of kings”, Christ Jesus. To this kingdom will go the glory of vindicating Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and blameless name and destroying completely all the wicked &quot;vessels of wrath” that he endured. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

All the visible creation, whether examined by telescope or by microscope or by nuclear physics, discloses itself more and more as the work of a marvelous master engineer. It is the matchless work of an intelligent creator, exciting amazement and delight, and no fault can be found with it. The faithful angels inhabiting the invisible realms on high must bless and celebrate the Creator in proof that they uphold his universal sovereignty and dominion. (148:2; 103 : 20) The day for any more indecision is past. It is the time for all the heavenly creatures to line up as commanded on the side of God’s universal dominion. Men do well to take their cue from angels, for man is made lower than the angels. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Jer. 31:31,34, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such forgiveness of iniquity and remembrance of sin no more means real justification for Christ’s followers who are brought into the new covenant. It is these faithful ones whom God brings into the new covenant through Christ that are made His new nation of integrity. The bringing in of a new high priest not of Aaron’s family and for all humankind meant the bringing in of a new covenant with different arrangements, provisions and obligations. The law covenant through Moses failed to bring into existence such an entire nation of integrity to God; and, after its failure over a sufficient period of time, that covenant was abolished at the death of the new high priest, Jesus Christ, on the accursed tree. The new covenant, however, will not fail to produce God’s desired new nation of integrity under Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

When the dead are brought out from under the Adamic death and are delivered from Hades, hell, or the unconscious death-state, then these are destroyed forever with respect to mankind on earth. Such destruction of them is pictured as the casting of death and hell into the lake of fire, the second death. There they are swallowed up and destroyed by God’s victory through Christ over the Adam-induced death. Those thenceforth perishing for their own self-chosen wickedness will not go down into Adamic death or into Hades or hell, but go down into the destruction from which no resurrection is provided or promised.

They are appointed to be the visible servant with whom God deals by Christ and through whom he does his Kingdom-witness work in the earth. They are made his visible channel, and under Christ Jesus their Head they are given the “meat in due season” to minister it. The members of this “faithful and wise servant” class must each be faithful on his own part with the treasure of service placed in his personal care. Each must be faithful to death in order to continue a member of that approved class and in order to be found worthy of a resurrection into the exalted, majestic presence of the Judge in the temple. By this course alone can they avoid being shifted over to the ranks of the evil, slothful servant class.—24 : 48. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Since our world wide movement is for advancing the worship of the Most High God, who offers salvation, it cannot help being also a righteous warfare against the death-dealing religions of this world. Such religions have overspread the whole earth and have cast great reproach upon the name and purpose of Jehovah God and have kept the people in darkness concerning the only means for their eternal salvation. The demons under Satan their prince are the promoters and backers of such religions, and therefore the warfare of God’s consecrated people is in reality an advancing fight against demonism. Carnal weapons are not used in this fight, and they could accomplish nothing against invisible demons. Only the spiritual weapons of the divine truth and worship are adequate for this warfare. All the demons are arrayed against us. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Almighty God and Creator has a right to let his faithful creatures on earth suffer because of tolerating the presence and activity of the wicked enemies. God’s right to do this is especially manifest when we see that the suffering we endure because of faith and obedience toward Him results in vindicating his sovereignty, and it perfects our obedience if we faithfully suffer, and God will reward such obedience and faithfulness to him with everlasting life and blessing in the new world in which Jesus Christ will be King of kings. For the sake of realizing his glorious purpose to vindicate his universal sovereignty and irreproachable name Jehovah God has held off from at once destroying the wicked. He continues to tolerate devils and wicked men until his time arrives to halt their organized wickedness. They are like clay vessels which the Potter reserves for destruction. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

He enjoys living now, because, with the life he now has, he is able to do things in this world that bring honor to God’s name and that make him known to others who want eternal life. Such a creature loves himself so much that he, if wise, will devote himself to Jehovah God, doing so through Jesus Christ, in order that he may attain to eternal life in the righteous new world. To urge him onward in his quest for endless life in the new world, the Creator’s Word says: “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.” —1 Tim. 6:12. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

It means that God has given him a position which is higher than that of any other creature. Additionally, in 1914, God gave fuller meaning to the name by bringing Jesus forth as King of the new world and enthroning him to rule amidst his enemies. This is now what the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font4"> of Jesus means for which we are privileged to be hated by all nations. It is for confessing to his name in this Kingdom capacity and for confessing him as our God-appointed Leader and Commander that we are privileged to be persecuted in all nations. For this reason we can he strong in the Lord to endure all the persecutions and we have the right to appeal to God to be merciful to us and to help us out during all the evils that our enemies bring upon us. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

If we undergo the experience rightly, it is a change for the better, winning us greater favor with God. It is therefore a thing to be glad for rather than to be glum about. If we appreciate the eternal values to be gained, far be it from us to shirk the tests of endurance. Let us enter into them with the best of what we have, and adding to ourselves also all that we can in order to come through successfully. We know what the issue is, and that our failure would bring reproach upon God’s name; and so we must exercise self-control and hold ourselves steady and not back out by making a bargain with God’s enemies.

<p><span class="font4">Do Christians have to revolutionize matters in an outward way so as not to miss out on their heavenward calling? Evidently not, since God does not look on outward appearances and does not show partiality toward persons on account of race, color, nationality or social and economic condition. Obedience from the heart is what counts with him. This can be rendered to him in whatever unchangeable outward conditions a person may have been when God called him. Otherwise, if his cbance to make good under such circumstances was nil, God would not have called him, because then to call him would be simply to mock him. Of course, a Christian today who is free can change his trade or occupation. Paul, who was freeborn, changed from being a tentmaker to becoming a full-time missionary to foreign lands when he was economically able to do so. That was something he could control and change; he was not obliged to abide as a tentmaker. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

He knows he could accomplish nothing by being rough in return to such misguided persons. Returning like for like would merely widen the gulf in between, and make it difficult for a later re-approach or for the next Kingdom publisher coming along.

To supply so essential a need to his people Jehovah would inspire his chosen writers with his infallible spirit. Jesus assured his apostles, and hence us, too, that it would be so.

Endurance by us will work out divine approval, and having his approval we can hope for the realization of the promises he has made, whether that realization be seemingly delayed or not. (5:1-5) We must endure to keep that hope, for endurance brings the consciousness that we are pleasing God.

All must minister to him, serving him in the unselfish way that he orders. If they love him, they will let no one hold them back from serving and ministering to him. If they love their neighbor as themselves, they will do their part as gospel ministers by serving it to them. IF </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11 f 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.—Heb. 7: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah, who made Christ Jesus King in 1914, has thus sworn with an unrecallable oath. As a priest Christ Jesus serves for the salvation of all those who in faith become his loyal subjects. As High Priest he is properly the uncompromising Champion of God’s pure worship and also the Chief Promoter of the worship and service of Jehovah. Knowing he is divinely commissioned to destroy all enemies utterly at Armageddon, Christ Jesus first of all promotes the pure worship of the living and true God now in the earth upon a permanent basis. He does so in order that some flesh might be saved at the final end of this world in Armageddon and that Jehovah’s worship may keep on uninterruptedly in the earth clear through Armageddon and into the new world forever. As far as extending Jehovah’s worship in all the earth goes, is there any visible proof? Yes, in Jehovah’s witnesses. IV' </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The eye that functions properly is like a lighted lamp to the body in the dark of night, because with it the body can walk without stumbling or bumping into something, and the hands can take hold and apply themselves to things without uncertainly feeling about and missing. Without the lamp of physical vision the body at the height of noonday might just as well be in the depth of midnight. But even with the eyeball in the socket, there is another requirement for our human body to be enlightened by it: the eye must be sound, “single,” as Jesus said. It must be simple, uncompounded, all one way in performing its function. For our whole body to be filled with informative, guiding light, there must be, not alone the entrance of light rays through the eye, but also the clear functioning of the eye, to make distinguishable the visual images that are flashed to it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The church takes part in the “first resurrection”, and this does not take place with them until after God’s kingdom is set up with Christ at his right hand. It is certain, then, that all the human dead in the graves (outside of the faithful church) have not gone to heaven at death nor into any kind of spirit world. They all went to the grave, which is the “hell” meant in the Bible and to which hellish grave Jesus went at death in order to redeem humankind and gain possession of the “keys of hell and of death”. (Rev. 1:18; Acts 2:24-32) To execute judgment upon such ones Jesus Christ must use the keys of hell and of death and must raise them from the sleep of death. Jesus will perform this miracle.

<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus knew how to be silent in excellent self-control. He did not sin by railing back at those who railed at him, even when he hung on the tree. He endured the suffering and did not part his lips to let out any threatenings. Never could any of his foes catch him in any of his words. He was obedient to God in word and deed, and kept his integrity as Job did. By guarding his mouth and moving his tongue always in the cause of truth and righteousness Jesus retained his hold on the right to everlasting life. The persecutors that transgressed God’s law and reproached and accused Jesus falsely met with violent destruction in due time. But Christ Jesus lives forever by virtue of a resurrection out of death and eats the good fruits of faithfully preaching the gospel on earth.

That is why the Nazi, Fascist, religious enemies were unable to break up, scatter and destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and to suppress their growth and increase all around this earth. By lightning warfare, the enemy thought to make away with them quickly; but he failed. It was because, by having had proper instruction and training during the years gone by, we had become all entwined with one another in the unity that marks God’s organization, all of us doing the one and the same thing, all of us having a common vision, all of us obeying the Theocratic instructions issuing through His organization, and all of us refusing to run and scatter before the enemy’s fire. It creates no surprise, then, but only praise to Almighty God, that we came out of World War II better organized, with greater strength and with greater numbers, than when we were thrust into it.

<p><span class="font4">For God not to be the God of dead Abraham, Isaac and Jacob he must resurrect them from the dead. He had not then done so. But God had unchangeably purposed to resurrect these faithful men of old through his Seed of the woman, and his purpose was so definite and sure of fulfillment that all these faithful ones, though then dead in the graves, lived to God and he could speak of being their God. Here was again a case of where “God, who giveth life to the dead, . . . calleth the things that are not, as though they were”. In due time his power, equal to every call and need, will make them to be what he has called them. (Rom. 4:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.

The One worthy to act as judge over all the universe could be only the Supreme One, and Jehovah is He. No one else could assume that position.

Those of his adversaries who have flouted his sovereignty for the past six thousand years and who have not been brought to judgment will be unable to escape or nullify the execution of Eis sentences.

Who those of that company will be, by name, the Bible does not reveal. Each one anointed with God’s spirit must determine for himself whether he will be of that obedient and approved company by merging his identity with it and by unitedly working with it as one of its members.

(Rom. 13:1-4) Since God’s kingdom was born in the heavens in 1914, his mighty enthroned King receives the long-awaited authority and girds it upon him to take action against all enemies of Jehovah’s sovereignty. Besides girding upon him this executioner’s authority pictured by the sword, he girds upon himself glory and majesty. That is, he takes to himself the glorious titles reserved for him and the bright-shining, conspicuous role of being Jehovah’s Chief Minister and Vindicator. We join the psalmist and bid this glorious, majestic King and Warrior to ride on prosperously to brilliant success.

<p><span class="font4">The anger of the nations began A.D. 1914, World War I beginning then. Forasmuch as judgment time begins at God's house first, the time came for the dead members of it, the “saints”, to be awakened from the dead in order to receive their heavenly reward. Their resurrection has not been discerned by the angry nations because they are resurrected as spirit persons to be united with Christ Jesus in the invisible heavens. Our time, then, is “that day” on which Paul and all those that love the Lord’s appearing receive the crown of righteousness laid up for them. This is the day in which the “temple of God” in heaven is opened in order that his judicial representative, Christ Jesus, might come and take his seat and start off the judgment beginning with the house of God.

He did this in order that they together might fulfill the duty of marriage and have a part together in filling all the earth with creatures of their kind, with righteous and perfect men and women. The bringing forth of these male and female children was that they too might join in wedlock and share in carrying out the divine mandate to fill the earth with humankind. It was an enormous duty that God set before this couple in Eden, namely, to bring children into existence and fill the entire earth with them.

Secondary matters such as eating and drinking, or personal habits such as smoking, should not be blown up to such swelling importance that they hide the main issue, the vindicating of Jehovah’s sovereignty and name by means of his kingdom, and the part we have in vindicating Jehovah on this issue by keeping our consecration to him and holding fast to our integrity to him. If some individuals need education on eating, drinking, observing days, and harmful personal habits, we will be tactful with them on these items.

When the fact becomes known to a person that a talebearer has been speaking ill of him to others, it can wound him deeply, almost to a point of never being able to be reconciled to the tattler. The hurt is deep-seated and hard to get out of the system. Aside from likely causing much harm, a talebearer is wasting time. If he would settle down to some profitable work instead of talking about things that neither upbuild the hearer nor benefit the one talked about, he would get something worth-while done and would not make himself poor spiritually. (14:23) What we need is deeds, not words. Idle talk, whispering about others, has been responsible for harm, and therefore should be avoided.

Each one thereof, regardless of his kind of sin, was guilty of sinning against the same God as anybody else was. So none was innocent in God’s sight. All needed to repent and become converted from the service of sin over to the service of God’s righteousness. Whoever, then, accepted the Kingdom gospel with faith and repentance was taken up by the “Father of mercies” just as he was. God forgave him through Christ.

It is that we may pass along the Kingdom tidings to others and that more publishers for God’s kingdom may thus be raised up and be trained for this same ministry. We must do more than just pray that the Lord of the harvest, Jehovah God, will send forth more laborers into the harvest because it is great and the laborers are few.

Then God his Father ordained Jesus to be his minister of the gospel news by pouring out his spirit upon him. (1:9-11) Thereafter Jesus, anointed with the spirit, declared that God had sent him to preach the gospel. If not at the religious theological schools, where did Jesus study?

In 1919 he delivered them from their fears and led them out from underground into a bold and fearless activity in the open public. Not for their sakes, but for his own name’s sake, he had preserved them; and now they must thank him among all peoples and sing his praise among all nations.

Since Jehovah God is the Supreme One and the Source of all life and creation, the vindication of His universal sovereignty and good name is of vaster importance than the saving of sinful human creatures. And yet it is through that very vindication that the redemption and saving of any human sinners is brought about.

<p><span class="font4">Neither wife, husband, children, nor griefs and joys, nor business relations and activities, should be allowed to engross our time and attention and to interfere with our gaining the kingdom of righteousness. Instead of an overload of the cares of this life in this old world, we should try to relieve ourselves of such cares as far as possible or avoid them. Then we can concern ourselves more fully with the things of God’s kingdom, which kingdom must now be advertised to all the nations as a witness to them. Christ’s death and resurrection, and now his coming into possession of the Kingdom in 1914, have curtailed the remaining existence of this old world. We must redeem the time for the new world interests. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The personality of each Christian is combined with the resurrection body that God is pleased to give, and thus each one is re-created. They are not re-created as living </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">human</span><span class="font4"> souls like Adam. Not at all; for these Christians were begotten by God's spirit to a spiritual inheritance and were given the conditional right to heavenly life, dependent on their faithfulness to God down to death. (1 Pet. 1:3,4) Hence in the church’s resurrection God gives the faithful members of it a life and body in harmony with the heavenly spiritual hope to which they were begotten. At the same time he re-creates their personality with all the faithful Christian qualities that they acquired on earth by following Jesus’ footsteps. In that way they are the same persons in spite of not being resurrected with the same bodies in which they died. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W lj/1</span></p>

All those lovingly choosing to do so during the Devil’s short-time loosing will therefore hold fast their integrity to God and will not deflect one iota from their allegiance to him. They will be for his universal sovereignty first, last, and all the endless time of eternity. Successfully enduring this perfective test to prove them perfect in obedience to God, the Supreme Judge will justify them to eternal life, by declaring them to be right in his holy sight. (Rom. 8:33) Then his Associate Judge, Christ Jesus, will inscribe their worthy names in the “book of life”, which will signify their receiving the priceless right to eternal life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1 Only, let your endurance be a finished product, so that you may be finished and complete, with never a defeet.—Jas. 1: If, Moffatt.</span></p>

Thus under the continuing trial we gain a manysided experience and a well-rounded-out understanding of how to take things, and we are matured and perfected in obedience and trust toward God. Under the proving of us we have the occasion or opportunity for exercising the same fine qualities that the faithful ones of old time, and especially Christ Jesus, showed which so won Jehovah’s smile of satisfaction and goodpleasure. We prove our dependableness toward God; and the dependable ones are the ones of whose integrity Jehovah God can be sure for all eternity.

<p><span class="font4">Whether exclusively of Jews or exclusively of Gentiles or of mixed membership, Christian congregations are all at peace and unity with one another and not conformed to this world of politics, commerce and demon religion. All are composed of persons consecrated to God and sanctified by His spirit upon them, and, resultantly, they arc “churches of the saints”, concerning which Paul states; “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.” (1 Cor. 14:33) Although physically separated by space or distance into many local congregations, the members of all these congregations together make up the one church of God, because they obey his commandments through his Theocratic organization and they have the one God-appointed Head, namely, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What about the thieves, the drunkards, the liars, the blasphemers, the persecutors of Christians, and various other kinds of sinners? Is one class of these pardonable if repenting and accepting the gospel, but another class not so? No; God classifies them all as sinners, that he might have mercy upon all. “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.” (Jas. 2:10, A.S.V.) By staying in such a sinful state and not repenting and converting to righteousness a person could never gain a place in God’s kingdom or attain to life in His new world. But if persons guilty of above-named sins do repent and submit themselves to the gospel provision, they may have the full confidence that God has pardoned them through Christ and remembers their sins no more.

He does not want to cause mischief, and be like a wicked man who finds pleasure in picking up information he can use against others. He knows crooked speech is certain to involve him in a mess. Because he wants primarily to do right and also to avoid trouble for himself and others he will not give ear to gossip and take tales to heart without direct investigation. A gossiper’s lips do not speak the knowledge of the Lord and of his instructions for his people; and the devoted person who loves God and his brethren in God’s organization will not tarry in the company of a gossiper.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah gives solid reasons for mankind to hope in resurrection of the dead. The first reason is his own word that such a thing shall take place. If the Almighty God puts his own word at stake on this matter, then who is there to claim that even this miraculous thing could be impossible for him? Another reason is that, having given his word, he has taken steps looking to the resurrection of the dead. He will not reverse himself. Having begun, he will carry matters through to a completion. No intelligent creature, Satan the Devil or anyone else, will be able to turn God’s hand back. His almighty power will support his word and vindicate it. His word will never be flung back into his face unfulfilled, but will be established as the truth. He gave typical samples to demonstrate his power. He has given an actual case of raising the dead to an endless life, Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God’s permitting the death of Christ Jesus on a tree was a point of judgment for the Jews. The Jewish nation of that day being made direct spectators of these things right in their midst were subjected to a judgment confined strictly to them. Jesus well stated it when he said, “Now is the judgment of this world,” because that nation throughout his ministry proved itself to be a part of this world. For this reason the “prince of this world”, Satan, was to be cast out or expelled. As represented in that hard-hearted, unbelieving nation and primarily its willfully ignorant rulers and princes, Satan was cast out as “the prince of this world”. This matter is to be taken seriously to heart by us today, because that was a small-scale typical picture of the culmination of the judgment period into which the world of today has entered, and particularly so-called “Christendom”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah rewards with salvation those who praise him. Praising him is the joyful privilege of those that live. Praising the wise, mighty and rich personages of this world is a forsaking and violating of God’s law. \Vhy? Because this world is the enemy of God and “the friendship of the world is enmity with God”, and “whosoever therefore will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> friend of the world is the enemy of God.” Enemies of God deserve no praise from those who profess to be His people, or Christians. (Jas. 4:4) God’s law directs the praise of his people to be directed to him through Christ, not because God is self-centered and conceited, but because he is worthy. The sincere giving of the glory to him wins his favor, and “in his favour is life”.—30: 5. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

We know, too, that these demons not only stir up clergymen and priests of organized religion against us as we carry forward Jehovah’s true worship but likewise stir up the political factors of this world to use the police power, judicial courts and legislative bodies of the land to operate against us. (16:14-16) But this is no proper ground for fear and quailing hearts, for, besides disclosing the combined demonic and human forces arrayed against us, God's Word opens our eyes to see also the superior hosts that are supporting us in advancing the pure worship, with Jehovah’s great, invincible Commander Christ Jesus at the head leading us forward to victory. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

He will overpower the opposition to God’s praise, even if and as it finally becomes necessary to fight it out at Armageddon for Jehovah’s eternal vindication. Hence our hearts are fixed and ready to sing the praise of Jehovah and his King, come what may come by his permission for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> test of our faithfulness and integrity. We know and are confident that his act of vindicating his universal sovereignty before all nations and peoples will come, and that shortly.

We shall be eager to help them in their service of him and to co-operate with them even if they, instead of ourselves, have been elevated to a higher position of service in the organization.

<p><span class="font4">Being translated into the Kingdom of the Son of God’s love must mean a transfer of one’s allegiance from this world of darkness over to God’s Son as His anointed Heir of the Kingdom. It means that such one translated is no longer in the dark as to who are the higher powers to whom every soul should be subject. Scripturally, the Higher Powers are Jehovah God the Supreme One and Jesus Christ, exalted to His right hand. (Rom. 13:1) So the translated one acknowledges God’s dear Son as King and yields complete obedience to him. In a case where there is a conflict between the kings of this world and God’s beloved Son they yield uncompromising obedience to the higher King, the One at God’s right hand. They obey Peter’s words: “Fear God. Honour the king.”—1 Pet. 2:17. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

It is bound to remain an unruly evil and to cause trouble and to poison the atmosphere and the lives of some now and then. Hence speech should not be hasty. To those who have been begotten by the great “Father of lights” with his Word of truth, James writes: “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” (3:8; 1: 19, 20) This is good instruction for times when we are under the fire of the arrows of slander and are inclined to wrath.

Finishing our course successfully to Jehovah’s vindication and winning the prize he reserves for us depends, from the start on, upon our steadfast continuance throughout the full length of the course. We cannot, therefore, hold out to the end if we hobble ourselves with hindrances and load ourselves down with things not serving the cause of righteousness and bringing sufferings upon us for such things. Even when stripped of such things, the requirements of us are still exacting enough to call for all we can muster of fortitude.

The Scriptures make it clear that the “evil eye” means envious vision, covetous vision, selfish, hypocritical vision. (Deut. 28:54-57) It begrudges another person his freedom to enjoy spiritual prosperity. It does not want the common people, from whom the religious leaders are fattening themselves with honor and wealth, to get free from religious bondage by Jesus’ teaching.

He speaks of them as “other sheep”, because these persons do not have a heavenly destiny and inheritance, but have the divine promise of life eternal on earth under the Kingdom. Their present position in companionship with the remnant of the bride is one of privilege, bringing great inward pleasure. Although they are not of the remnant with the prospect of heavenly marriage, they are glad in what God provides for them.

It also means protection to us in this wicked world. Where there are two or more together, there can be co-operation and reciprocal action. They have a good reward for their laboring together, because they draw mutual benefits from such co-operation and from enjoying the society of one another.

Because they thus showed they were in favor of God’s kingdom by Christ, and because they lent support and active co-operation to the remnant of his brethren in increasing the Kingdom interests under hardship and opposition, the King judges them worthy of everlasting blessing on earth in the new world and under the kingdom of heaven.

God ordains such consecrated one to be his minister. When?

It is reasonable to want to live, not that you are inherently immortal, but because the knowledge of God and the enjoyment of his bounteous provisions make life worth living. So there is nothing improper and unduly selfish in loving yourself to the degree where you want a happy existence in God’s new world of righteousness, whether in heaven or on earth. Now, if you want life for yourself, then, according to the second great commandment, you should love to see your neighbor also gain eternal life. (Mark 12:30,31) You should love your neighbor just that much, and should accordingly help your neighbor to get that life provided by God through Christ which you want for yourself.

<p><span class="font4">There is some distinction between judgment and condemnation, and a judgment need not necessarily be condemnation to destruction. For a Christian of the “house of God” to be condemned with this world it means his destruction in the “second death”, without possibility of a resurrection from the dead. Going back to the ways and companionship of this world of which Satan the Devil is god and prince is most serious. (2 Pet. 2:20,21) If this world were not condemned to annihilation, then condemnation with the world would not be so calamitous for those of the house of God.

It is no establishment of a world-wide political organization upon a religious basis. The church of God, composed of His “children of the kingdom”, has no such political aims and purposes. Hence Christ’s planting of the good seed from Pentecost onward means simply the raising up of the members of the ‘people for God’s name’ who are taken out of all the nations that God visits with his Kingdom message. They are heirs or children of God's kingdom, which is heavenly. Harvesting them as “good seed” now at this end of the world means bringing them together in peace and unity in distinct separateness from this world to serve as His witnesses. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">By his endurance as a man on God’s side Jesus held on to his right to everlasting life, yes, immortality, and he said for his hard-pressed followers at the end of the world: “Hold out stedfast and you win your souls.” (21:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font4"> What he bids us do we can do. And as we hold out steadfast we will keep our minds, not on the physical painfulness of the sufferings and the mental grief of the reproaches, but on the reasons why we should be joyful. A person having knowledge of Jehovah God and of the great issue concerning his good name and sovereignty is strong. And having God's holy spirit or active force upon him to make up for his weaknesses, he is made still stronger for keeping at God’s service with the right attitude of mind. There is secret strength in our knowing for whom we are privileged to undergo hardship. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

The witnessing activity of the anointed remnant, the ‘man in linen’ company, put it there. Under the direction of this anointed remnant the marked ones of good-will join in helping with this educational work. They have been marked because of hearing with faith and coming to the Lord in consecration and public confession of him; and his command through his Messenger at the temple is, “Let him that heareth say, Come,” that is, say “Come” to still others who are willing and in need of receiving the mark in the forehead before Christendom falls at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">This anointing refers to his installation in the throne to be king, in 1914. This was a most refreshing experience after he had waited for nineteen centuries at God’s right hand. It ushered him into the joy and gladness of Jehovah’s reigning as King over all the universe. The gladness with which Jehovah his God anoints him exceeds that of all fellow kings. This does not mean kings that have reigned on earth since Jesus’ ascension to heaven in 33 (A.D.), but means all the kings of the lineage of David that reigned upon the throne at Jerusalem from David to Josiah. They were all fellows in sharing in the benefits of the Kingdom covenant that God made with King David. But that Kingdom covenant reaches its climax and complete fulfillment in Christ Jesus, for his kingdom and gladness are for evermore. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">If the unbeliever were not sanctified by the believer, then children born to such a married couple would be like mongrels and unclean in God's sight. But God recognizes their being married and knows that the sanctified believer is one flesh with the unconsecrated mate; so God mercifully recognizes the children of such union as holy or sanctified. It is because the unbelieving one is sanctified by his believing mate. And just as the believer treats his unbelieving mate from this standpoint in his endeavor to honor and please God, so he will treat his children which he has by the unbelieving one. Hence he will discharge his parental duty of bringing such children up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. There will be no parental prejudice against them, because there should be none against what is holy. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Anyone that receives the gospel word with any acceptance should not delude himself about it. He is taking something to himself that will draw upon him the heat of affliction and persecution if he lives up to it and holds on to it. But if he keeps on appreciating the value of what he is receiving, then he will not merely accept it with gladness but also count it all joy when he encounters trials of persecution and tribulation for holding fast God’s Word and talking it to others. The persecution will not wilt and destroy his fruitfulness, but he will steadfastly endure the scorching heat of the enemy’s fire. He will keep on holding forth fruit for the sustenance of others who hunger for food from God’s Word. He has no stony heart of hypocrisy, but is like good soil.

<p><span class="font4">In Christ’s body Jehovah God finds a usefulness and service for each and every member, and therefore he anoints each and every member with his holy spirit or active force. Mindful of this comforting fact, no member of the body will feel so inferior that, because he does not have a more outstanding and far-reaching part in God’s service, he will view himself as no part of Christ’s body. Because Paul, as an apostolic member of the governing body of the church, declared: “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection,” and, “I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence,” that does not mean that women devoted to God and anointed with his spirit are no part of Christ’s body nor given a certain service therein to render. (1 Tim. 2:11,12) To correct such a discouraging, divisive outlook the apostle wrote the leading text above. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God did not excuse sins of ignorance, yet he did arrange a way whereby such sins might be atoned for to bring the sin ner back into his favor and under his mercy. Thus the sinner that discerns his former sin in the light of the truth afterward received may have confidence in drawing near to God. In the case of a person that becomes a Christian member of the church or becomes a consecrated person of good-will, sins of ignorance must be confessed with repentance as in the Israelite type, and the sacrifice that must be resorted to for divine forgiveness and cleansing is that of Jehovah’s great High Priest, Jesus Christ. (Prov. 28:13) He commands all men to repent because of the coming day of judgment conducted by his Judge Christ Jesus. By means of his Word that is preached to them God commands them to repent.-—Acts 17 : 30, 31. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W It/15</span></p>

They have manifested faith like those men of old, but some have died and will yet die faithful before the fiery end of this world in Jehovah’s great battle for vindicating his sovereignty. These modern-day “sheep” as well as the faithful ones of old will come forth to a “resurrection of life” on earth. At once on coming out of the graves they will step onto the way to everlasting life, and the King will have nothing against them, just as he will have nothing against the “sheep” that survive the Battle in which this world ends. However, for them there is yet a final test to pass.

Since Jesus speaks of these evildoers as being “in the graves” it indicates something hopeful for them. In Scripture Gehenna symbolizes everlasting destruction, and if they were in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font4"> they would not come forth in a resurrection from the death state.

<p><span class="font4">Everything with which God filled this earth is His creation and belongs to him and so is not sinful in itself. Meat that was set before him by his heathen host Paul accepted as being God’s creation and belonging to him. That meat or the carcass from which it came, Paul looked upon it objectively as being God’s creation. In thus viewing it he could thank God for it and not the idol to which it was offered. However, Paul’s Christian companion might look at it, not objectively, but from the standpoint of its heathenish religious connections. Hence his conscience rebelled at eating, because he objected to idols and to recognizing them in any way. He felt that meat to be contaminated by the heathen rite. But Paul knew that despite being dedicated to an idol, the animal victim still belonged to God its Creator, and he could conscientiously thank God for a piece of it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

It let them express themselves according to each one’s individual style and spiritual gifts. They were left also to use the powers of study, research and investigation with which God had endowed them and then were allowed to make expression of themselves with truthful motives. His spirit reinforced the matter by blessing their love of the truth and by supervising them and guiding them to truthful expressions in writing. Hence the inspiration of their writings may not have been one making them automatons, robots, under control of plenary, verbal or word-for-word inspiration. Yet it guided them to express faithfully the sense or thought of what they had heard, seen or felt.

Down to this year 1948 the natural Jews see this taking place, with themselves on the outside, in worldly darkness. They have seen the believers, Jewish and Gentile, delivered out of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God’s dear Son. By persistent, intensive witness-work since A.D. 1919, Jehovah’s witnesses have set before men’s eyes the facts concerning God’s kingdom as symbolized by the typical Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets.

But Christendom is not the one to decide on the salvation of any individuals. Our orders from God are, as given also to Ezekiel: “Thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.” (2: 7) Our report must at last be turned in to God our Commander, and not to Christendom, for she will perish forever at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">They have “done evil” in this life, for they have never come under God’s favor for exercising faith and obedience toward him. The “resurrection of judgment”, or standing up to judgment, does not mean those who are reserved for this are damned or condemned right at the start and that there is no show for them during Christ’s thousand-year reign. There is a difference between “judgment” and “condemnation”. (Luke 6:37; Rom. 2:1) This difference shows that the day of judgment need not necessarily be a day of condemnation for all, and the judgment meant in the “resurrection of judgment” does not necessarily mean “judgment of Gehenna” such as the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day could hardly escape.

It is unquestionably because of this fact that Satan the Devil stirs up the world to ridicule our hope. Our Scriptural hope is that if we gain God’s final approval we shall be rewarded with everlasting life in the new world. Our hope is in God’s deliverance of us from this old world and its misguided servants. This hope we must build up more and more by continuing in the way of God’s approval, holding on to that way although in it we must run the gantlet of affliction from the world.

We can have no sympathy with what is wrong, even if committed by one dear and near to us by fleshly ties of family or by ties of elose association.

Since it embraces within itself so many different elements with such differences to divide them, this earthencircling organization could not carry on in unity in the Lord unless it had a central, visible governing body. By means of such it can be held together, to work in solidarity according to common organization instructions. At first the governing body was made up of the twelve apostles of Christ and of elder brethren closely associated with them in important positions for governing the Christian congregations.

<p><span class="font4">Christians who give up their virginity or singleness will have the outward troubles of married life, “tribulation of the flesh,” and the apostle would like to have the single ones spared that. It was because in the ordinary course of married life the couple marrying have taken on a burden in each other and it may lead to further responsibilities in the way of children. Unavoidably, troubles are due to come amid this present distressed world-condition and because of human imperfections, faults and unwisdom. Hence let those in a virgin state be cautioned beforehand that, although they may not sin by now getting married, they will be putting themselves in the way of new troubles, which they must bear while fulfilling their obligations in God’s service. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

He is “the Son of David”, hence heir of the Kingdom covenant that Jehovah God made with David when king in Jerusalem. Oue of King David’s responsibilities was to serve as judge for the nation of Israel. Concerning him we have it reported: “David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.” (2 Sam. 8: 15) In his son Solomon’s first recorded sentence as royal judge he made a reputation for himself. (1 Ki. 3:9,28) Fittingly, too, Christ Jesus undertakes the judgment proceedings after he becomes God’s acting King in 1914.

It simply means that those at last judged worthy of everlasting life will not have their names written in the “book of life” until the end of the thousand years and after the final test by Satan the Devil loosed for a little season. In his absolute control over the resurrection of the dead by Christ Jesus God will bring forth humankind at the proper time to get the benefits of the thousand-year rule of man’s Redeemer. But no evildoers coming forth in a resurrection to judgment will have their names recorded on the “book of life” until the end of the thousand years, if they pass the final, deciding test of integrity then.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 9:27,28, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If men die after judgment which follows as a result of Christ’s death for them, he will not redeem them again. He died to cancel the sin and death inherited only from Adam, and their death because of sinning during the period of judgment will not be due to inheritance from Adam. If, however, after entering into the period of judgment before God, they turn to righteousness with Christ’s help, then they will enter the way of everlasting life. They will avoid the “second death”, everlasting destruction, from which there is no redemption or recovery. Hence it does not unavoidably await men, nor is it appointed to men, to die after they enter the period of judgment. Eternal s.-.lvaii.m is possible.

May we gird up the loins of our powers of endurance, and may we stick to the post of watchmen who must sound out the Lord’s warning. Then, after a faithful watching and crying out of the signs of the times, we shall, on some ardently desired day, have our eyes blessed with the vision of the Lord’s victorious war-chariots riding into view and our ears will be set tingling with the freedom-sounding announcement: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon.” (21: 9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Till then, no quitting on our part, by God’s grace I Continuance at our posts of service day and night, and endurance to the triumphant end! be our watchword. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Two are better than one; . . . And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him.—Eccl. 4: 9,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whereas an enemy can prevail against one victim, he cannot prevail over two whom he assaults. The two can offer a united front against this common enemy. The one can come to the other’s defense and rescue. In the interest of safety God’s people need to stick together under him. All of them throughout the earth need to do so, ignoring national boundaries, racial differences, provincial customs and habits, political rulerships, and all other things that divide the peoples of the earth normally. To stand firm against all the enemy assaults that the future holds in store for us,- we need to band together in one united company under our Leader Christ Jesus, standing shoulder to shoulder, giving one another support in serving God, and confronting with compact, serried ranks the common foe. Let us be unbreakable in doing so. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word.—1 Tim.</span><span class="font4"> 4 ■ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How old must one be to become an ordained “minister of God”? As respects the Levite Samuel the son of Elkanah, he was specially dedicated to God from before birth, and he was put to service at the tabernacle right after he was weaned from his mother’s breast. Was this boy indeed a minister of God at so early an age? Listen to this quotation from the record: “And Elkanah went to It am ah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.” (1 Sam. 2:11,18, A.S.V.) That was a case before Christ, but Timothy is a case since. At 1 Thessalonians 3:1,2 the apostle Paul calls Timothy a “minister of God”. Timothy’s case is a concrete one to prove that a young man or woman can still be under twenty years of age and yet be an ordained “minister of God”, without having attended a theological seminary. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Your light must burn.—Matt. 5:16, An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A genuine obedient follower of Christ must be active and positive, beaming out to his neighbor the light that shows up God and Christ Jesus in their glory and life-saving power. The light is good; and letting it shine to others is good work; and the only way you can let your light so shine before men as to induce some to glorify God is to get out there among the people where they can see the good that you do and where they can get the benefit of it. When Jesus was filled with the spirit of God he went out preaching as the Light of the world. If you want to be part of God’s organized people who are now the visible light of the world, it is necessary to likewise be “on fire with the spirit” and get out among the people, making confession with your mouth before them that they may be enlightened. Thus serve the Lord as his minister. Then you will be doing what is right and safe. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house: so will the king desire thy beauty; for he is thy lord.—Ps. 45:10,11, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having received God’s invitation to become Christ’s jointheirs, the remnant must forget the things behind and cultivate and strengthen their appreciation and devotion toward the things set before them by their heavenly Father. For the Kingdom’s sake they will not let human relations and earthly nationalities govern their choices, decisions and course of action. They turn the back upon religious, commercial and political gods of this world, and worship the God of their Bridegroom-King. They honor the King as they honor the Father. They bow to the will of their heavenly leather in mating them up with his anointed King: “whom having not seen, ye love.” (1 Pet. 1:8) They try to appear lovely to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font4"> eyes, if not to men’s eyes, that he may desire their spiritual beauty. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lie thou exalted, 0 God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.—Ps. 57: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not exalt worldly men or seek honor from men, but we do let the grandeur and gloriousness of the Most High God rise up before our minds. To pray for the exaltation of men and their world-governiug machinery would mean denying God’s kingdom. Hence while men exalt themselves, we cry out for God to exalt himself by displaying his universal sovereignty. We call upon him to openly vindicate his supreme sovereignty before all creation and to show puny men of the earth their baseness and pettiness. Instead of being smitten with fear by the enemy fierceness and might, we pray that unselfish prayer, because we have taken our immovable stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty over all the universe, including our earth. We know he will not disappoint that prayer, no matter what we may have to endure until it is fulfilled. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">December 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I have done as thou hast commanded me.—Ezek. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a work of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">salvation</span><span class="font4"> in which we are engaged. Nothing is of greater importance to the people within and without Christendom. No grander privilege could there now be on earth than to have a share in this work to the extent of our consecrated abilities. Now is the time to do it. Armageddon comes on apace, at which time Jehovah will command his executioners under Christ to follow up the ‘man in linen’ company and go through all the earth and slay off all the unmarked persons, young and old, male and female. Then the marking work will be carried on no farther. The fateful time for turning in the final report to our divine Commissioner, Jehovah, will have come. By our course of action now all the faithful-hearted ones will determine to be associated with that company that will then report to Him: “I have done as thou hast commanded me.” Such a report will please God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

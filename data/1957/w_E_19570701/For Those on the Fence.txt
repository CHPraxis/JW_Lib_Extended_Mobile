For Those on the Fence
● Faith on the March “is a fascinating account and is a very important contribution toward the history of the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses for the past many years. The account is lively, full of human interest items and wields a powerful witness against the enemy, not overlooking the clergy. The material presented concerning the historic years 1917, 1918 and 1919 is superb, revealing the hand of the clergy. Truly this book should do much to open the eyes of many men and women who are still sitting on the fence as to their actively associating with the Society.”—A. D. S., New York.

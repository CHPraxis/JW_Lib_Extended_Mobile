<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Truth usually tells its own story and always inspires confidence. That is what a reader of <em>Faith on the March </em>wrote the author, A. H. Macmillan. He said: “It is going to be fine to pass on your book to many good-will people to give them the inside working of things. A lot of them are going to be greatly impressed, for the note of extreme candor flows through every page.”—H. L. P., Massachusetts.</p>

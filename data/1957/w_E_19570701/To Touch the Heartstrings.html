<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● <em>Faith on the March </em>“is a thrilling masterpiece and is needed to enlighten the organization on the history of the things from Brother Russell’s day until our time, of which many today know nothing. You have woven a golden thread throughout, depicting Jehovah’s hand in directing the organization from its beginning. It is as the jacket so aptly states: ‘inspiring and spiritual’ and we can add, faith-inspiring to all who read it. You have put the human touch in it as well as enough humor and, as the Greeks would say, ‘pathos’ to touch the heartstrings of all right-hearted people of this old perplexed world.”—F. F., West Virginia.</p>

Half a Century of Joy
● A. H. Macmillan’s “Life of joyous service with Jehovah’s witnesses” will be multiplied a thousandfold through his book Faith on the March, according to a delighted reader who writes: “Your documented account going ‘way beyond the past half-century’ and recounted by one who has been in the front ranks of the battle these many years will bring great joy to untold thousands of people at this time.”—F. S. B., Oklahoma.

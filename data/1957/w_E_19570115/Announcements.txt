ACTIVE TRAINING REWARDED BY GOD
All who want approval from God must be training themselves with godly devotion. This kind of training builds up the individual, fitting him for use in God’s service in ever-increasing measure, and “holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” It is therefore “beneficial for all things.” (1 Tim. 4:7, 8, NW) In keeping with this Bible counsel all of Jehovah’s witnesses actively share regularly in ministerial service by telling others about God’s kingdom and aiding them to become proclaimers and ministers of that glorious kingdom. Without exception, this month they will continue their work of calling on people with lifegiving knowledge, presenting the Watchtower magazine at $1 for a year’s subscription. With each new subscription the valuable 96-page booklet What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”? will be given free. This is also a good time for you to send in your subscription and to obtain subscriptions from friends whom you have interested in the good news.

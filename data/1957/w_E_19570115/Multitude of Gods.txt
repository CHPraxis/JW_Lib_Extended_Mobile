Multitude of Gods
 Petronius, who lived in the first century of the Christian era, was director of entertainments at the court of Nero. In his Satires, chapter 17, Petronius tells us how he felt about the Roman state religion. “Our country,” wrote Petronius, “is so peopled with divinities that you can find a god more easily than a man.”

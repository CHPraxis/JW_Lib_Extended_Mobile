<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Petronius, who lived in the first century of the Christian era, was director of entertainments at the court of Nero. In his <em>Satires, </em>chapter 17, Petronius tells us how he felt about the Roman state religion. “Our country,” wrote Petronius, “is so peopled with divinities that you can find a god more easily than a man.”</p>

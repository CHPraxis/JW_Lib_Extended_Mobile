The Deaf Also “Hear”!
● A Canadian presented a doorstep sermon to a deaf-mute by underlining the scriptures in his Bible and having the deaf-mute read them for himself. Impressed, he asked the witness to come back and help him prepare a sermon for him to give at a school for deaf-mutes. Later, a witness who could speak the sign language was located and began a regular Bible study with the deaf-mute, also helping him to prepare sermons to give at the school. Other deaf-mutes attending the school showed interest and began asking questions, enabling the deaf-mute to ‘preach’ to them further and place literature.—1957 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

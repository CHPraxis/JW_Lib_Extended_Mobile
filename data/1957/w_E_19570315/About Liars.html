<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● From Europe comes the story of the village priest who told his congregation: “Next Sunday I will give a sermon about liars. I want you all to read Chapter 17 of St. Mark’s.” On Sunday the priest said: “Those who read Chapter 17 of St. Mark’s raise their hands.” Almost all the hands went up. Then he explained: “St. Mark’s has only 16 chapters. I will now give a sermon about liars.”</p>

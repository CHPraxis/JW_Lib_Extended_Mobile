<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the past year the London office of the Watch Tower Society received a letter from a secretary of the United Bible Societies, saying that the writer had been asked to make inquiry into the methods of Scripture distribution. “No one can make such an inquiry,” he wrote, “without realizing that one of the most effective and efficient agencies for Scripture distribution is Jehovah’s witnesses.” In replying to this courteous letter the Society pointed out that their success was due to the noncommercial motives that prompted the witnesses and because their aim was not mere Bible distribution but education for life.—1957 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>SHARERS WITH JEHOVAH RATHER THAN WITH DEMONS</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In typical Israel the anointed priesthood served as Jehovah’s ministers. They were allowed to partake of portions of sacrifices made on the altar to Jehovah, which made them sharers with Jehovah at his altar table. All Israel was commanded to refrain from making offerings to idols, for to do so would mean their sharing with demon gods in opposition to Jehovah. Similarly, today men must choose whom they will serve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:21-46:10:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:21</a>, <em>NW</em>) To choose to serve Jehovah willingly one has the grand privilege of sharing with Jehovah at his altar table and finds resultant joy. Those failing to worship and serve thus are drawn into the camp of demon worshipers, there being no neutral ground in this day of decision. Service of God means doing his will, proclaiming his truths to his name’s honor and vindication. In the month of April Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to share at Jehovah’s altar table by offering their willing service and inviting others to learn of him by subscribing for the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. A free booklet entitled “What Do the Scriptures Say About ‘Survival After Death’?” will be given with each new subscription at $1 a year.</p>

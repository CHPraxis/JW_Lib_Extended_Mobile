<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>THE USE OF THEOCRATIC WAR STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In time of war great effort is made to keep one’s movements or plans from the enemy. To keep the enemy in the dark and divert him from gaining knowledge, war strategy is used. Soldiers for Christ in dealing with enemies of God, who hate truth and want to stop others from learning it, wisely use theocratic war strategy, not to hurt or harm, but to keep the “wolves” from hindering efforts to aid sheeplike people who are hungering for knowledge of truth and righteousness. On meeting “wolves” Christians will use strategy, being wise as serpents yet innocent as doves, in accord with Jesus’ direction at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 10:16</a>. Throughout May, just as in April, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to seek sheeplike persons by calling from house to house. The May offer will be two Bible study aid books and two booklets on a contribution of $1. All participating in the work during April will want to continue in May and the coming months, honoring Jehovah and aiding other sheep while time permits.</p>

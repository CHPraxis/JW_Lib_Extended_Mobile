<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Every day during the past year Jehovah’s witnesses spent an average of more than 238,000 hours in preaching to others, made over 75,000 return visits with interested persons and placed an average of well over 50,000 books, booklets and Bibles, and more than 152,000 copies of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. That is a remarkable daily total, truly a great mass of witness to the name and majesty of the God and Creator whom they serve. Are you having your part in the expansion of this Christian activity during 1957?</p>

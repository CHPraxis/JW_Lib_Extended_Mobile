<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> When an article in The <em>Watchtower </em>not long ago stated that persons were put to death for doubting the trinity more than one reader inquired about this. Of course, medieval history tells of countless thousands of Jews being put to death for refusing to accept the trinity. And especially noted is the case of Servetus, whom Calvin had slowly roasted to death at the stake for his denial of the trinity.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"> But it is not necessary to go back so far, for there was an Act passed April 21, 1649, in the state of Maryland, or rather the colony of Maryland, which among other things stated: “By this Law, (1) Blasphemy against God, denying our Saviour Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or denying the Holy Trinity, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, etc., was to be punished with death, and confiscation of lands and goods to the Lord Proprietary.” Yes, there was a time on the American continent, not just in medieval Europe, when to deny the trinity meant death.</p>

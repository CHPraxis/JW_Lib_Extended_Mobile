Communist Hypocrisy
● “Why do we not declare in our program that we are atheists?” asked Nikolai Lenin in 1905. The Communists, of course, thought they would get more adherents by not advertising their atheism. But when it suits them and when it makes their propaganda more effective, Communists do not hesitate to call on God. Recently Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev said that though Stalin made mistakes, they had not been essential, and asked that “God grant that every Communist should be able to fight like Stalin.” Khrushchev’s calling on God to make all Communists like Stalin prompts the quoting of a passage from Robert E. Sherwood’s book Roosevelt and Hopkins: “Suddenly Stalin exclaimed, ‘May God help this enterprise to succeed!’ (The translation of this remark, as given by Churchill to Roosevelt, was: ‘May God prosper this undertaking!’) I have been told that it was by no means unusual for Stalin, who had been educated for a time in a religious seminary, to invoke the aid of the Deity.” Hypocrisy knows no boundaries in the realm of communism.

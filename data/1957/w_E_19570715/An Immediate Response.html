<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A. H. MACMILLAN’S new book <em>Faith on the March, </em>published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., has been available in the bookstores only a few weeks, yet its reception has been immediate and widespread. It is on the best-seller list of the New York <em>Times </em>and <em>Herald Tribune </em>and other newspapers. Scores of letters speak of the comfort, the joy, the understanding it has already brought to old and young alike. To quote just a few:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“For the younger ones in the truth it will be like a revelation in many respects and the old ones will be very happy that the experiences and happenings of the earlier days of the work are presented to the brothers and to the public in this excellent form.”—A. R., Switzerland.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“There have been times in my life I had wished I lived back there in 1914, especially when I would hear the elderly brothers in the congregation speak of their experiences, but I had often wondered about the detailed things, such as how Brother Russell felt when the end didn’t come in 1914. What were his reactions toward it; also, what kind of a man was he? Also, about Brother Rutherford; why was he so firm, and was he as bold as some people say he was? I can only remember my grandfather playing some of Brother Rutherford’s records, for I was just a youngster and new in the truth and never saw or heard him in person. So you can see why I thoroughly enjoyed your book, for it has cleared many questions that have been in my mind for a long time that no one else was able to answer. Now I feel like I really did live through those years.”—E. B., Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“It is very strengthening and encouraging to read the true life experiences of a brother who has lived through the entire period of the modern history of the New World society. This unique book will in its way reprove many a young member of the New World society who may think he has too much to do, shame many who have the tendency to get impatient and fidgety and humble many others who may begin feeling too important. I have gotten to appreciate even more the ‘beauty of old men with the gray head,’ especially if every single hair has become gray in the New World society.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:29-20:20:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 20:29</a>)—P. K., Netherlands.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Without hesitation I say this new book fills a gap; it is a book that holds the attention from start to finish. We have no doubt whatsoever that it is going to prove a real blessing not only to some of us old stagers but to many people of good will who can now get a picture of certain features of our organization that was previously unobtainable. They can also get from this book a general idea of some of the fundamental doctrines told in a simple fashion and easy to understand.”—W. O. W., Scotland.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“I cannot refrain from expressing my deep gratitude to Jehovah for this heart-gripping, soul-stirring account of historical events in fulfillment of Bible prophecy since the time of Brother Russell’s world-wide preaching activity forty years ago. It will prove to be a powerful weapon with which we can refute and break down the bitter opposition of fanatical religionists to the Kingdom good news. All honor and praise to our Great God and heavenly Father Jehovah for this further manifestation of his undeserved kindness and tender watch care over his devoted servants!”—W. B. F., Massachusetts.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“With all the trials, struggles, hardships and tests recounted, it makes an indelible impression of a triumphant march. Your approach to many trying experiences, your understanding of the reactions to them throws a flood of light on some difficult years. You have related this march of triumph step by step so connectedly and interestingly that the ‘other sheep’ can get a crystal-clear picture from the time there was only a little handful to the great prosperity today.”—H. M. K., Indiana.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“The personal touch is appealing and makes the link with the past very much alive and real.”—J. N., Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“My heart was overflowing with joy as I traced and relived your many marvelous experiences since you became acquainted with Jehovah’s truth. Your whole book is filled with the spirit of Jehovah and it gives all the honor and glory to him, where it rightly belongs.”—G. E. K., New York.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“True Christians everywhere will find this book engrossing as well as hope-inspiring. And may it be the pleasure of a host of sincere persons of whatever religious persuasions to draw spiritual strength from its rich contents to Jehovah’s praise.”—J. L., Ohio.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● William Benton, publisher of <em>The Encyclopædia Britannica, </em>recently visited the Soviet Union. In his report he said concerning Christendom’s religions in Russia: “Of the influence of religion I shall say only that the regime’s slightly more tolerant attitude today does not mean that it is relenting in its militant atheism; it may only mean that, in Russia, religion no longer worries the Party. I saw very few Russians under age 60 in church. Khrushchev said not long ago, ‘Religion is still the opiate of the people, but we are strong now and not afraid of it.’”—<em>Britannica Book of the Year </em>for 1956.</p>

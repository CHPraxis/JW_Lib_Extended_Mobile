Futility of Modern Preaching
● A professor of theology at Chicago’s Federated Theological Faculty, Marcus Barth, son of the European theologian Karl Barth, was quoted in Time magazine, February 18, 1957, as saying regarding modern preaching: “In Europe the preaching is on a deeper and more dogmatic level than here, but the churches are empty all too often. Here the preaching is close to the people, the churches are full, but the problem is whether the congregation hears anything in the sermon which its members have not already read in their morning newspapers and have already told themselves.”

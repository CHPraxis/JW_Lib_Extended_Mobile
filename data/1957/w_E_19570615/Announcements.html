<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>AIDED TO ONENESS UNDER THEIR CREATOR</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is unity and oneness among the faithful servants of Jehovah God. But this unity or oneness is not attained or acquired without conscious effort. It does not come automatically. Therefore at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> (<em>NW</em>) the exhortation is given to cultivate oneness. For people of good will toward Jehovah God, the Creator, to be aided to oneness with Him, the need exists to bring them information from the Bible outlining how they may attain oneness under their Creator. Jehovah’s witnesses are in position to supply this vital information and will gladly do so throughout July by calling on people at their homes offering a bound Bible study book containing knowledge that will aid others to oneness under their Creator. A contribution of 50 cents will be accepted from those who take the book. Thereafter the minister will be glad to return at the convenience of the householder to explain further how oneness under the Creator may be attained.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No place you could go this summer would do you more good than one of the district assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. Are you going? You will hear inspiring and instructive talks on the Bible, you will receive valuable information on how you can improve your ministry, you will be made more seriously aware of the important place young people have in the congregation and how we can make their position more secure. Your association with the thousands attending will strengthen your faith in Jehovah’s leadership of the New World society and will give you a spiritual uplift that will carry you through many weeks of more isolated activity. Plan now for all five days. Here are the times and places: July 3-7, Houston, Tex.; Miami, Fla.; Toronto, Ont. July 10-14, Denver, Colo.; Moncton, N.B.; Seattle, Wash.

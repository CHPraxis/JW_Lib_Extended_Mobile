Another Admission of Christendom’s Failure
● Writing about Jehovah’s witnesses in the article “The Startling Witnesses” in the February 13, 1957, issue of The Christian Century, Marcus Bach concludes his subject: “How shall we deal with them? What shall we do? What should be our advice to those who insist that ‘somebody ought to put a stop to them’? What shall we say to the black-robed cleric who jostles them on the street? There is but one answer: Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a threat, but a challenge calling once more upon the traditional church to—witness!”

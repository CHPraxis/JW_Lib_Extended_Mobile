Toynbee has said: “Looking back over the twenty-one civilizations I have studied, I am not sanguine about man’s ability to make a good moral decision if he aims only at a worldly goal. Love of mankind has been a force in history—but only when it was a by-product of an intense love of God. The great need of the modern world is a rebirth of supernatural belief. Without it, man—unregenerate man—is hardly to be trusted with the dangerous toys his laboratories have hatched.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The Bible commentary <em>The Interpreter’s Bible, </em>Volume V, page 364, comments on the tendency of the ancient nation of Israel to turn to Egypt for help instead of God; the book then draws an enlightening parallel with Christendom today: “As Hebrews they had a name of worshipers of Yahweh—that was their religion. But in a crisis it was not to their God they turned, but to the cavalry of Egypt. Are we in the modern world in any other plight than were these discomfited Jews? We have claimed to be Christian and have so labeled our civilization. Has anything characteristic of Christian faith marked our proposals to solve international issues?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">●“Does modern history justify our repeating the motto of faith <em>In Domino confido? </em>Has it not been the bitter accusation leveled against us time and again by angry men: ‘You are Christian in name, Christian in conduct when it suits you, and for the rest of the time you play the world’s game’? The apologist cannot evade that challenge. Speak as he may of the influence of the church for good, name as he can victories of Christian faith, he cannot deny that after twenty centuries of Christianity we have not produced an economic or social order which is Christian in emphasis or spirit; we have not come within sight of achieving world unity, and we have acquiesced in conventions, practices, and aims which are at entire variance with the ideals and spirit of the religion we profess.”</p>

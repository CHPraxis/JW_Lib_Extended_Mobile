Two Viewpoints
● Sir John Slessor Marshall (Royal Air Force) has said: “What has happened is that war has abolished itself because the atomic and hydrogen bombs have found their way into the armies of the world. . . . But if we accept the truth that war, in the sense of total world-wide ‘shooting’ war, has abolished itself through nuclear and thermonuclear energy, then the world can cease to tremble.”
●English historian Arnold J. Toynbee has said: “Looking back over the twenty-one civilizations I have studied, I am not sanguine about man’s ability to make a good moral decision if he aims only at a worldly goal. Love of mankind has been a force in history—but only when it was a by-product of an intense love of God. The great need of the modern world is a rebirth of supernatural belief. Without it, man—unregenerate man—is hardly to be trusted with the dangerous toys his laboratories have hatched.”

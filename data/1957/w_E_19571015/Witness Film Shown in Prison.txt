Witness Film Shown in Prison
● The prophet Jeremiah foretold that the Lord’s sheep would be gathered “from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks” by hunters and fishers that Jehovah God would send. (Jer. 16:16, AS) That literal jails and prisons are among the places where such sheep are to be found is apparent from the reports being sent to the Watch Tower Society. A recent one (April) tells of two men in a prison in Massachusetts taking their stand. The witness of Jehovah who studied with them also reported: “I thought you would be interested to know that I managed to show the film ‘The New World Society in Action’ in prison on March 21. There were twenty-nine inmates, two officers and the Protestant minister in attendance. The minister gave up his time for group study for the showing. There would have been many more but permission to see the film was denied the Catholic prisoners.”

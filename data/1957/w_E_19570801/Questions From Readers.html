<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Enclosed is an article, “Zealous Vandal,” from <em>Nature </em>magazine, issue of December, 1956. Is this a proper way to witness to the truth?—C. T., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The magazine article has photographs of two rocks in Washington state’s Olympic National Park. On one is written in white letters two feet high: “<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:3-2:6:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 6:3</a>, Almighty God’s name is JEHOVAH.” On the other is painted: “<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">PSALM 83:18</a>, That men may know that Thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over the earth.” The article comments: “It is extremely doubtful that responsible officials in the religious denomination to which this offender belongs would sanction the practice of using national parks for such purposes.” It adds this observation as to the effect of the signs: “They startle some viewers and disgust most.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No, this is not a proper way to witness, and no mature witness of Jehovah would use such methods that deface public places and stir animosity instead of good will. Both the Bible and the Society stress preaching by means of house-to-house calls, street witnessing and home Bible studies, where the publisher of truth uses the Bible and Bible literature and words from his own lips. In their own way the heavens and earth bear witness to Jehovah the Creator, reflecting his majesty and power and grandeur, as the Bible tells us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:20</a>) Human creatures have ways of reflecting Jehovah’s praise also, and these ways are set forth in the Bible. Defacing the outdoors and cheapening the message in the eyes of others is not one of those Biblically approved ways.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Incidentally, the Society’s magazine <em>Awake! </em>published an article in its August 8, 1956, issue, entitled “Save Parks from Becoming Slums,” which lamented the lack of appreciation for the national parks.</p>

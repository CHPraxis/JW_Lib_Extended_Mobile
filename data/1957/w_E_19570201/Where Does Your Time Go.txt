Where Does Your Time Go?
 A survey taken the week ending September 1 showed where a great deal of it may be going. The Americans interviewed spent an average of 18 hours 24 minutes watching TV. This was in addition to 4 hours 6 minutes spent in movie theaters. Add that to other forms of amusement and you will see the need to hesitate the next time you start to say, “I’m too busy” for God.

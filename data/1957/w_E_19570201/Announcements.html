<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What is the most essential training to which we should give attention? Plainly the Bible tells us: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim. For bodily training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” In obedience to this clearly expressed counsel all of Jehovah’s witnesses want to follow the example of the great Trainer, Christ Jesus, who is our model and teacher. Just as he displayed unquestioning godly devotion by faithful ministerial service, so it is with us today. In accord with his instructions to preach “this good news of the kingdom,” during February each one of us will display godly devotion by active participation in house-to-house work, offering a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine for $1. The excellent 96-page booklet <em>What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”? </em>will be given free to each new subscriber. Share in this grand activity throughout the month and be richly rewarded.</p>

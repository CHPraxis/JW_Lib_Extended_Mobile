<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> A church in Clarksville, Tennessee, recently held a revival with a visiting evangelist from Texas officiating. Each person attending was given a small part of a shoe sole as he entered. As the services began, the worshipers were informed that the shoe sole represented their soul and that if they valued their soul they were just to wrap their part of the shoe sole in a $5 bill and place it in the collection plate—another evidence that the false shepherds are busy fleecing the sheep today instead of feeding them.</p>

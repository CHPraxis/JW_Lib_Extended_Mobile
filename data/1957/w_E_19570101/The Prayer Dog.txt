The Prayer Dog
● The prayer dog lives in Tibet. The animal, a Tibetan spaniel, resembles the Pekingese. Small ones are kept in monasteries, where they are trained to turn prayer wheels. On the outside of the prayer wheels and on strips of paper within, Tibetans write the sacred Buddhist formula, “O, the Jewel in the Lotus, Amen.” When recited it is supposed to ensure rebirth after death in the heaven ruled by the Buddha of eternal light. Every time the prayer dog revolves the prayer wheel the Tibetan considers that all the written prayers have been duly said.

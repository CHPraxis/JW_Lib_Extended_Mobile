<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The year 1956 is gone but by no means forgotten. In the short remaining time before the climax of this world’s affairs at Armageddon each year leaves its indelible record of service activity performed to Jehovah’s praise. The good news that Jehovah’s kingdom has been established in our day has now reached 162 lands! Every month this past memorable year 591,556 ministers were busy with this message, an increase of 20,000 over the year previous! But results are not to be counted in numbers alone. You will want to obtain and read the 1957 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>which gives you a stirring account of how this growing activity has been attained and how these determined preachers have persisted in preaching from door to door, city to city, through jungle fastnesses and urban areas, on the streets, in public parks, in the homes and native huts of people of good will, speaking freely from the Bible of God’s kingdom under Christ as the only hope for men of all kinds. Send also for the colorful 1957 calendar illustrating the expansion of praise. The <em>Yearbook </em>is 50c; the calendar is 25c, or $1 for 5.</p>

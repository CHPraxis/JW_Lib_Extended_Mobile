<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● To those who live in figurative glass houses, a familiar proverb advises that they not throw stones. A small town in the country of Panama threatened to stone the Watch Tower missionaries every time they entered to preach to them. The people finally did carry out their threat, but instead of stoning Jehovah’s witnesses they vented their anger by stoning the priest out of town because of an argument over funds that had been collected for a <em>fiesta</em>. One man remarked to a Watch Tower missionary: “We gave him what he always wanted us to give you.” The little town has been excommunicated, the doors of the church are closed. Now, however, Jehovah’s witnesses are well received. Due to this a door of opportunity is being opened to the people of that vicinity that before has always been closed to them, that is, a chance for them to learn and understand the Bible. The townspeople express an eagerness to want to find out what true Christianity really is.</p>

‘TELL THE GOOD NEWS FROM DAY TO DAY’—Ps. 96:2.
To tell good news one must have good news to tell. Jehovah’s witnesses have the very best of good news to tell, for they are the bearers of the message of salvation through God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. They are proclaiming the good news that God’s kingdom is now established and its King is ruling now while his enemies are still in power, as foretold by Psalm 110:2, AS: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” This means the final end of the present wicked system of things is at hand. This is good news. Delighting to share the good news of salvation with others, Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to be able to “tell the good news of salvation by him” from day to day. (Ps. 96:2) Throughout the month of December all of Jehovah’s witnesses will joyfully participate in house-to-house ministerial service at every opportunity, in order to have the greatest possible share in telling to all who will listen the good news of salvation. In addition to an enlightening and helpful three- to eight-minute Bible sermon, a Bible-study aid book and booklet will be offered on a contribution of only 50c. Be sure to join in telling the good news of salvation to others at every opportunity.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">ONE of the most astounding accounts in modern times of a faith that has surmounted all obstacles is the fascinating book <em>Faith on the March, </em>by A. H. Macmillan. It is the story of a group of dedicated men who refused to be turned aside from their way of worship, who forged new links in the long chain of faithful witnesses to the supremacy and loving-kindness of Jehovah God. It is a faithful record of the integrity and determination of these Christian men and women, which will inspire persons of all faiths.</p>

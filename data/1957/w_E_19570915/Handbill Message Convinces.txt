Handbill Message Convinces
● One way in which the Watch Tower Society makes the most of its opportunities is by printing messages on the backs of the handbills that advertise its public lectures. That doing this serves a good purpose is apparent not only from the requests for literature the Society receives from readers of the handbills but also from the reporting of such experiences as the following: “As the mother of five small youngsters, I used to find very little time for reading. But usually the day I washed and waxed my floors I’d read in the corner I had waxed myself into. On this particular day when I found myself in a corner I didn’t have a thing within reach to read. Then I remembered the little handbill a lady had left several weeks earlier. I had put it in my empty planter lamp on the radio. Because it was near I thought I might as well read it, rather than sit there idle. I was so convinced on the subject ‘Is Hell Hot?’ that I decided to look into the religion more thoroughly. As a result, both my husband and myself are sincere believers of the truth, and thank Jehovah for the many ways, though small, he has for gathering his sheep.”

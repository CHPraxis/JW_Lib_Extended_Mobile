<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>LIFE IS NOT A GAMBLE</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Life is not a gamble. Neither is right religion. You would avoid unnecessary risk physically. Why take chances spiritually with your everlasting life? You can lose it through ignorance, endanger it by negligence or you can win it by ‘making sure of all things.’ How? By going to the right source for information. The world is full of confused and contradictory ideas and beliefs. Religions differ as to doctrine and even as to what God requires of us. Who is right? Each one, of course, thinks he is. But what does God’s Word say? Do you really know? Can you call to your use the scriptures that give authority for right doctrine? <em>“Make Sure of All Things” </em>places them at your fingertips. It is a pocket-size hard-bound book of 416 pages that lets the Bible speak for itself. Seventy Bible themes and 287 subjects are presented without comment. Bible texts, quoted from eleven translations, provide the answers. Obtain <em>“Make Sure of All Things” </em>today by sending 75c.</p>

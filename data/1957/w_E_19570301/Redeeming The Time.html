<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Choir boys should be heard, not seen, according to Vicar John Nicholls of Carlton, England. He prefers to have choir stalls out of sight so that the boys may read “wholesome Christian books and periodicals” during his sermons. When sermons are based on politics and other mundane fads of the day, as they so often are, better that choir boys read, especially, the Bible. Might not parents also get more from Bible reading than from such sermons?</p>

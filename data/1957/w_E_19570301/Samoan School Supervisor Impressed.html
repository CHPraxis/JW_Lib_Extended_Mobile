<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● One of the weekly meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses is the theocratic ministry school and one of the features of this school is the training in the arts of composition and public speaking. To aid the instructors of such schools the Watchtower Society has provided “counsel slips” on which are listed all the points that should be watched in a talk, in regard to both composition and delivery. The 1957 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>tells of a school supervisor in American Samoa who attends such a ministry school. He was so impressed by the system used that he adopted it in making observations on the schoolteachers under his jurisdiction. When the director of education inquired for the reason that his reports were so improved he gave full credit to the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and the system they use in their ministry schools.</p>

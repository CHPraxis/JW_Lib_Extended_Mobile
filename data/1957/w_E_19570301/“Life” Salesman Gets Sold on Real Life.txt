“Life” Salesman Gets Sold on Real Life
● A magazine salesman called on a certain young couple who had just recently taken their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses. They made good use of the opportunity to tell him of their newly found religion. It seems he had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and was amazed to learn that they went from house to house giving Bible sermons and placing literature without profit. He asked if he could hear a sermon. After hearing it he had many questions and asked for someone to call on him and his family. So the salesman of Life magazine, the couple writes, was sold on everlasting life!—1957 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

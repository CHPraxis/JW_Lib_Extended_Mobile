<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In <em>Tarbell’s Teachers’ Guide </em>are some comments by Frank S. Mead about what the average professed Christian worships: “A famous Chinese gentleman stood in the New York Stock Exchange not so long ago. . . . He was so impressed with the furor and intensity of the Exchange that he cried, ‘Ah, this is their <em>real </em>religion! This is what they care about!’ Well, is it? Wouldn’t you say that we are worshiping Mars, the god of war, as much as we worship Jesus Christ? Every able-bodied boy in the country may be forced to give two years of his life to the art of war; how many give two years to Jesus Christ? Others worship Bacchus; they live to have a good time. Others worship the god of the machine, or the god of the cash register, or the god of athletics, or . . . How many more can you supply?”</p>

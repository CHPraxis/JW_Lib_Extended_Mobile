<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Materialism prevails today. The goal of many persons is to gain possessions, to buy nicer clothes, to build a nicer home, to get a newer car, and to pamper their passions. Satisfying personal desires is their goal, so when a Christian witness of Jehovah comes to their door they wonder what he gets out of it. Yet, his spiritual reward is far greater than any reward received by those who are looking to the things of the flesh. As Paul wrote to the Galatians: “He who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but he who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.” How you are sowing will determine which reward you will reap.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:8-48:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:8</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

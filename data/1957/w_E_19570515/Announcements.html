<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE’S “GIFT FROM GOD”</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The true enjoyment of God’s gifts is not found by engaging in selfish pursuits. So whether one has the gift of singleness or has chosen the gift of marriage he will follow the apostle’s counsel to keep in sight the great privilege given to all dedicated servants of Jehovah, married or single, the “treasure” of service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:7-46:7:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:7</a>, <em>NW</em>) The single are more likely to have greater opportunities in this connection, but by mutual consent those married may apply to a considerable extent the Scriptural advice that “they that have wives be as though they had none,” not to the detriment of either, but to the advancement of their service toward God. In June the enjoyment of one’s gift from God will mean engaging in field service with the offer of two books and two booklets on a contribution of $1. All who wish may join in this grand service to God.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A wealth of knowledge and information has been gathered and recorded and is now available in our modern libraries. Few persons question the value and importance of such reference works. However, recorded knowledge of the most important human need, life itself, is to be found in the best-known and most widely distributed book of all, the Bible. It is a library of books.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● On the fiftieth anniversary of his entry into the radio, television and electronics field, Brig. General David Sarnoff, chairman of the Board of the Radio Corporation of America, congratulated scientists, research men and engineers on their developments in the field of electronics. At that time, last September 30, he also made twenty predictions for the future. One of them concerned science and religion. On this subject he said: “As a reaction against current cynicism and materialism, there will be an upsurge of spiritual vitality. The gradual elimination of physical hungers will deepen the more elemental hunger for faith and salvation, for age-old values beyond the material and temporal that gnaw at the heart of man. Science begets humility. Its every discovery reveals more clearly the Divine Design in nature, the remarkable harmony in all things, from the infinitesimal to the infinite, that surpasses mortal understanding. The physical processes and laws of the universe are logical, all-embracing and wholly dependable. They imply a Supreme Architect, and the beauty and symmetry of His handiwork inspire reverence.” The apostle Paul stated the same thing about the Supreme Architect’s works when he wrote: “For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they [ungodly men] are inexcusable.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

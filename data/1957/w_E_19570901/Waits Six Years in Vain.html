<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A Boston, Massachusetts, widow of eighty-three years, crippled and bedridden, laid aside ten cents each week of her old-age assistance to give to her pastor if and when he should visit her. After waiting six years one of Jehovah’s witnesses called and began to study the Bible with her. Some eight months later this widow insisted that the witness accept the ‘widow’s mite’ she had been storing all this time. The witness, however, sent it to the Watch Tower Society to help send missionaries to foreign lands.</p>

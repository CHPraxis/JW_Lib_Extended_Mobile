<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>LIVING TRUE TO OUR DEDICATION—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Eccl. 5:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dedication means a decision to do Jehovah God’s will, to serve him in spirit and truth with all the heart, mind, soul and strength forever. Having made this vow of dedication one must “defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.” Sharing in Jehovah’s service is a prime essential in fulfilling dedication vows. Such service includes making known the truth about Jehovah and his kingdom by Christ Jesus. As Jehovah’s witnesses participate in this blessed work, each in an assigned territory, news of the Kingdom is spread far and wide. During September Jehovah’s witnesses will call on people at their homes and offer a Bible-study aid in book form on a contribution of 50c.</p>

Vigorous or Casual?
● In the revelation by Jesus, given to John, we read: “These are the things the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God: ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or else hot. So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” How is your temperature?—Rev. 3:14-16, NW.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To be living up to one’s dedication vows to Jehovah God is of vital importance, as brought to our attention at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a>, where we are counseled: “When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.” A must in fulfilling dedication vows is sharing regularly in preaching the good news of the Kingdom for the purpose of a witness to all nations. This Jehovah’s witnesses delight to do, and they prove it by diligently arranging their personal affairs so as to always have time and energy to engage in the preaching work. During September all will share in the house-to-house service, giving first an enlightening three-to eight-minute Bible sermon and then offering a superb Bible-study aid bound book on a contribution of 50c. Live up to your dedication vows by sharing in this blessed service at every opportunity.</p>

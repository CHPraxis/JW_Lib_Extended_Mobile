<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A Houston, Texas, teen-age miss writes: “While I was taking senior year civics in high school the subject of communistic propaganda arose and one student said that the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine was an advocate of communism. I decided to remain silent for a while and observe the comments and the reactions of the class, which was, by this time, in a general uproar. Immediately several students explained that their parents subscribed for <em>The Watchtower </em>and that it had nothing to do with communism, while others said that they had read other Watch Tower publications and that these were far removed from communism. The class decided unanimously that <em>The Watchtower </em>was Christian.”</p>

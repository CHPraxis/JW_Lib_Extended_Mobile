<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>ENJOYING EACH ONE “HIS OWN GIFT FROM GOD”—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:7-46:7:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>1 Cor. 7:7</strong></a><strong>, NW.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Both the married state and the single state are referred to in the Bible as gifts from God. Both have certain advantages. The married state removes certain difficulties that men and women may experience, while the single state leaves one free from the responsibilities and limitations of marriage. Dedicated Christians carefully weigh the choice to be made, always keeping in mind the bearing their choice will have on their God-given treasure of service. But whatever the choice, one still has the privilege and obligation of using his own “gift from God” to Jehovah’s praise. So Jehovah’s witnesses, married or single, will continue during June to make known the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. They will offer to all persons on whom they call two splendid Bible study aids in book form, together with two booklets containing outstanding Bible talks, all on a contribution of $1.</p>

Truth Requires Repetition
● In 1828 the noted German poet and novelist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said something that is still true. “The truth,” he said, “requires constant repetition, because error is being preached about us all the time, and not only by isolated individuals but by the masses. In newspapers and encyclopedias, in schools and universities, everywhere error rides high and basks in the consciousness of having the majority on its side.”

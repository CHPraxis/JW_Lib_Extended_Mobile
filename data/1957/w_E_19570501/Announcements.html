<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>1957 DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES FOR THE BRITISH ISLES, CANADA, HAWAII AND THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is important that true Christians meet together, this being a God-given assignment. Jehovah’s witnesses are keenly interested in doing this and having their friends join them because of the rich spiritual food that is always provided.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is now time to arrange for attending one of these assemblies. Which one? The one of your choice. All of the fifteen assemblies (five in the British Isles, three in Canada and seven in the United States) will be for five days and will have identical programs. The assembly in Hawaii is for four days. Spanish programs will be provided at Los Angeles, Houston and Baltimore. One of these assemblies will be reasonably close to your home. Be sure to attend. (Assemblies will be held in many other lands this year too. For information concerning these you may write to the branch office of the Society nearest you.)</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>USE THEOCRATIC WAR STRATEGY—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 10:16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">How are the sheeplike publishers of God’s kingdom truth to accomplish their God-assigned work in the midst of wolves? How can they carry on their good work surrounded by such ravenous persons and survive? Jesus told them how, saying: “Look! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses follow the counsel of their Leader, Christ Jesus, and if any on whom they call show the wolflike disposition they will use due caution. With warlike strategy they will avoid giving such persons the opportunity to interfere with their lawful work, and leave them to their own misconceptions. They will go to those who welcome the truth. During May the offer will be two Bible study aid books and two booklets on a contribution of $1. Those who had a share in this grand work in April will want to continue in May also.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>KNOWLEDGE IS A SOURCE OF LIFE</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Knowledge is a source of life. Not that the mere collecting of factual information is sufficient. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a> states: “The excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.” Since wisdom means the applying of information to accomplish good, this scripture emphasizes not just the acquiring of information, but also the use of it wisely to gain eternal salvation. Are you satisfied with your knowledge of the Bible? Could you turn to the Scriptures and wisely instruct some dear friend or relative in even the fundamentals of Bible knowledge? Do not dismiss the responsibility by saying, “That is the work of the clergy.” Paul told <em>all </em>the early Christians—not just the overseers of the flock: “Although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) Equip yourself now. It is vital to your life and to those whom you could instruct. Send for the two valuable hard-bound Bible study aids <em>“Let God Be True” </em>and <em>You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</em>. Send $1 today and you will also receive free two instructive booklets.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Many people today have just a surface view of their religion, but this cannot be so of the true Christian. He must have much more. His knowledge and faith must go down deep, else he will not take the course that will lead to the salvation of either himself or others. He must weigh, consider and meditate, and come to a mature knowledge of the truth that leads to life. This is why the apostle Paul wrote to the young man Timothy: “Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15, 16</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

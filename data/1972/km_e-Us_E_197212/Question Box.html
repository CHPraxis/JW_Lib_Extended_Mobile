<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Should the presiding overseer serve as a book study conductor?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This is something to be worked out by the local body of elders, with consideration for the individual involved. Where possible, book study conductors should be elders, as pointed out on page 81 of the “Organization” book. Ministerial servants may be used on a substitute basis if there are not enough elders to care for all the book study groups.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In a large congregation where there are more than enough elders to care for all the book study groups, it may not be necessary for the presiding overseer to serve as a book study conductor. However, if there are not enough elders to care for all the groups, it would be beneficial for the presiding overseer to serve as a book study conductor. If he is the only elder regularly attending a certain book study, then, of course, it is to be expected that he will be the study conductor. When he visits the other book study groups once or twice a year, depending on the needs of the individual groups, the one serving as his assistant can take care of the book study in his absence.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It should not be necessary for the presiding overseer to spend extended periods of time visiting groups that have elders as conductors, since the elders should be well qualified as teachers and otherwise be able to care properly for the needs of the group. However, in certain cases it may be advisable to spend several weeks visiting groups where ministerial servants are conducting the study on a substitute basis, in harmony with what is stated on page 71, paragraph 2, of the “Organization” book.</p>

Vacation Opportunities
1 Many congregations in the United States have territory that does not get worked at least once each year. Generally such territory is rural and requires considerable travel to work. This past summer a number of pioneers and publishers assisted in covering such unworked congregation territory during their vacation, or on the way to or returning from an assembly.
2 While you may not be able to spend two or three months working in unassigned territory, as some do, you may be able to spend a few days or possibly a week or more of your vacation next summer helping a congregation to cover some of its unworked territories.
3 If you want to assist in covering unworked congregation territory next summer, why not begin making plans now? Information will be supplied later on in Kingdom Ministry as to how you can find out which congregations need help.

How Did We Do in September?
Continued fine efforts were put forth in the field ministry during September to search out interested ones by the house-to-house ministry and to help sheeplike ones to learn the truth by means of regular Bible studies. Isn’t it encouraging to know that 5,770,237 hours were spent in various features of the field ministry and that well over 8 million Bibles, books, booklets and magazines were placed with the public!
The total of 421,149 proclaimers of the good news is an increase of 12,804 over last September, when 408,345 reported field service activity.

Lawlessness Can Be Curbed
Proper education is a major factor. When people regularly read and apply the Bible’s moral guidance, their lives are changed for the better. An early American president, Thomas Jefferson, said: “The studious perusal of the Sacred Volume will make better citizens . . . The Bible makes the best people in the world.”
Now you can read the Bible in easy-to-understand modern-day language. Reading the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures has beneficially changed the lives of thousands of persons. Its regular 1,472-page hardbound edition, complete with concordance, appendix and maps, is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and German, for only $1 per copy.
The deluxe, with the same features as the regular edition, has a flexible black cover and gold-edged pages. Only in English. It is $3.
Available, too, is the large-print edition, only in English. Its type and page size are the same as in the main part of this magazine. Send only $5 for this splendid 1,376-page Bible, black covered with gold lettering.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What was life like in early Bible times? What did people eat, drink and wear? What did they do for entertainment? In what kind of homes did they live? Do you know?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Factual answers to these and hundreds of similar questions are found in <strong>Aid to Bible Understanding. </strong>This illustrated volume of 1,700 pages, with many maps and charts, was over five years in preparation. Some 250 researchers in more than 90 countries contributed to the work. One appreciative reader wrote: “It draws one closer to the people in ancient Bible times, their way of life, how they thought, worked, served God, etc.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">By “Awake!” correspondent in Rhodesia</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">FRIENDS of ours named their baby daughter <em>Do Not Fear. </em>You may think, “How peculiar!” But before you feel sorry for her, let me explain that her parents are African, and they speak Chishona. In their tongue <em>Do Not Fear </em>becomes <em>Musatye, </em>a very pretty name if you pronounce it correctly.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now, shall we try <em>Musatye </em>again? Moo-sa-chke. If you repeat it several times, it will be in your ears like the call of a bird.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Without doubt, among our many readers are those who have bestowed upon their children Bible names such as Sarah, Naomi, Daniel and David. These are easy to pronounce and never old-fashioned.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In ancient Israel names were usually given because of the meaning they conveyed. And this is true to a considerable extent in Africa today. You will find it interesting to know the whys and wherefores of naming African babies.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong><em>Parents Speak</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At hand is a letter from the Chishona-speaking parents of <em>Musatye. </em>Both father and mother are dedicated servants of Jehovah God, and they devote 150 hours a month to preaching to others about the wonderful purposes of the true God. This is in addition to caring for their family of seven. <em>Dennis, Stella </em>and <em>Reuben </em>are their first three, but three of the last four children were given Chishona names: <em>Musatye, Vimbai </em>(wē-mbī) “Feel Confident,” and <em>Kurirai </em>(koo-rē-rī) “Overcome.” The fourth was named <em>Witness. </em>The parent explained:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">‘When we were naming our last four children, we did so with the thought of encouraging ourselves as a family in the Christian faith. For example, when calling <em>Witness, </em>the family as a whole would know that we are Jehovah’s witnesses. When calling our girl <em>Musatye, </em>the family as a whole would know that we must not be fearful of those who kill the body and are not able to kill the soul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>) When calling <em>Vimbai, </em>the family would know that it should be confident, loyal to Jehovah and his organization. When calling <em>Kurirai, </em>the family would know that we should overcome difficulties put on us by the Devil and by other enemies of Jehovah and his organization.’</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">If <em>Musatye’s </em>father were to call these last four children one after the other, he would practically be giving a sermon, and a stirring one at that. Another happy thought is that this family has gentle reminders every day of what they want to be or do. Surely these are good reasons for giving thought to selecting fine names.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The mother of another family writes that having only sons is not as bright a picture as having both sons and daughters, and she reflects this attitude in her choice of names:</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>“The first girl in my family is <em>Chiedza </em>[chē-edzä]. <em>Chiedza </em>means ‘light.’ I named her <em>Chiedza </em>because I wanted children of both sexes in my family. I had already given birth to two boys, so when I gave birth to a girl there was <em>light </em>in the family. The second girl is <em>Tsitsi </em>[tsē-tsē]. <em>Tsitsi </em>means ‘kindness.’ I named her <em>Tsitsi </em>because <em>Chiedza </em>was the only girl in the family and had no partner to play with, so it was kindness for the second girl to be born into the family.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong><em>Say Them Aloud</em></strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In the four main dialect groups of the Chishona-speaking people there is a wealth of pretty names. You are sure to enjoy the following selection if you read them aloud.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><em>Tendai </em>(te-ndī)​—“Give Thanks.” One man named his son this because, though he loved his four daughters, he was <em>thankful </em>that his fifth child was a boy.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Ngoni </em>(ngō-nē)​—“Mercy.” An appreciative couple bestowed this name on their second child because they considered it a great <em>mercy </em>to have another son after the death of their firstborn.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>Chipo </em>(chē-pō)​—“Gift.” <em>Farisa </em>(fä-rē-sä)​—“Make Happy.” We have met many <em>Chipos </em>and <em>Farisas, </em>but I was most impressed by a mother who had four sets of twins and seven other children. Would you be <em>made happy </em>to receive your fourteenth and fifteenth <em>gift </em>of children? She was. She permitted me to hold these two beautiful, velvet-skinned babies, and I shared her happiness.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>Rudo </em>(roo-dö)​—“Love.” This name is found in every Chishona-speaking community, and its popularity is equal to that of John and Mary among the Europeans. In view of the fact that God is love, and that Christians are commanded to love God and love their neighbor, it is little wonder that <em>Rudo </em>is one of the favorite names. As with many other African names, it is one that can be given to either girl or boy.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong><em>Deeper Meanings</em></strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The significance of names is not always readily apparent. A long list of events or perhaps the family history will be recalled by a name given to a baby. For example, the names of the children of a friend of mine intrigued me, and I had the meanings all worked out in my mind. However, see how wrong I was, as pointed out by the father:</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Hatina </em>(hä-tē-nä)​—“We Do Not Have.” Since she was their firstborn I reasoned that the parents thought, “We have no child but this one.” But the father explained: ‘It is the African custom to desire big families and many relatives, but of my paternal grandfather’s family of ten only three lived. Of my own father’s offspring there were only two. Consequently at the birth of my daughter I said, <em>“We do not have </em>relatives.”’</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>Tapfuma </em>(tä-pfoo-mä)​—“We Are Rich.” My thought: “They have two girls and now a son so they are <em>rich.” </em>But that is only a small part of why the father chose this name. His reasons: ‘I came from a poor family and had very little education, and yet by the time my third child was born I could count my <em>riches </em>like this: As a watch repairman I worked and bought a motorcar; we have a son as heir; and, most important, we have the privilege of prayer and a knowledge of God’s truth that puts us in line for eternal life. Thinking of all this, I then said, “Now <em>we are </em><span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span><em>rich.” </em>That is why I named this boy <em>Tapfuma.’</em></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><em>Netsai </em>(ne-tsī)​—“Trouble.” This word can also mean “Weary.” To my way of thinking, four children in six and a half years would cause the mother to be weary. But the difficulties that prompted the name were not attributed to the child. The father said that his wife had been dangerously anemic, his mother ill and his firstborn, <em>Hatina, </em>sick also. Since the child came into the world during a period of <em>trouble, </em>she received that name, but not as a disparagement to her. Did you read <em>Netsai </em>aloud? Lovely, isn’t it?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>Names in Other Languages</em></strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">As you may have noted, parents sometimes use English words to name their children. For example, some children grow up with names such as <em>Gift, Precious, Shepherd </em>and so forth. An African teacher said concerning his son: “I named him <em>Blessing </em>because I felt that it is God Jehovah who gives good gifts [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>], so the child came to me as a <em>blessing </em>from Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Many African marriages end in divorce if there are no children from the union, and having only one child seems disgraceful to a great many of the people. But not so with this man and his wife of the Nsenga tribe who, for ten years of marriage, had only one child, <em>Samuel. </em>To their second-born son they gave the name <em>Lundu </em>(loo-ndoo), which has two meanings, “calm” and “delayer.” This well describes their quiet, untroubled, <em>calm </em>married status during the ten-year <em>delay </em>between <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Lundu.</em></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Cinyanja-speaking people living in Rhodesia are from either Zambia or Malawi, and they too select interesting and sweet names for their offspring. To mention a few: <em>Chisoni </em>(chē-sō-nē) “Compassion,” Chifundo (chē-foo-ndō) “Mercy,” Chuma (choo-mä) “Rich.” A circuit overseer of Jehovah’s witnesses expressed his view of being father to twins by naming them <em>Madalitso </em>(mä-dä-lē-tsō) “Blessings” for the son and <em>Chimwemwe </em>(chē-mwe-mwe) “Joy” for the daughter. These parents occasionally address the twins by the English words as well.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">To give your child the name of a person of faith in the Bible is certainly commendable, especially if you know the thought behind it: Sarah, “princess”; Naomi, “My Pleasantness”; Daniel, “God Is (My) Judge”; ‘David, “Beloved.” Like those Israelites of old, we see many of our African friends also giving their children names with thoughts behind them. It can be a delightful way of selecting a name. And <em>Do Not Fear </em>is an encouraging thought and quite an acceptable name for a little miss if you say it in Chishona, <em>Musatye.</em></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sf"><strong>[Footnotes]</strong></p>
<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p30" data-pid="30">Here are some pronunciation helps for the Chishona language: ä as in far; ā as in fate; e as in pet; ē as in bee; ī as in pint; ō as in note; oo as in room; aw as in pawn. Roll all “r”s softly, otherwise you will lose some of the attractive melodious sound. Where the following consonant combinations appear in a name they have the sound of those in the words in parentheses: ch (chain), mb (comb), mw (am with), nd (end), ng (singer), ny (Kenya), pf (top few), ts (its).</p></div>

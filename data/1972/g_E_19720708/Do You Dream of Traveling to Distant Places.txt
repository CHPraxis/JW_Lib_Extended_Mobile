Do You Dream of Traveling to Distant Places?
It is interesting to see people who live differently from the way you do. It can be educational to learn about their way of life.
It may be that you do not have the financial means to travel to other lands. Nevertheless, you can enjoy listening to people in distant lands as they talk about their way of life, their personal activities and their experiences.
You will enjoy the articles in Awake! magazine that tell about peoples in other lands. Through their eyes you can see the things of interest there and can become familiar with their way of life. In this way you can feel the pulse of life in distant places. Articles from various countries appear in Awake! throughout the year.
Have Awake! come into your home regularly. It will arrive twice a month for a year if you send only $1.50.
Please send me Awake! magazine for one year, for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the gift booklets “This Good News of the Kingdom,” Look! I Am Making All Things New” and Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.

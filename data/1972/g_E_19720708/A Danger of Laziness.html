<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● God’s Word repeatedly counsels against laziness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:4-20:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 13:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:14-20:26:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26:14, 15</a>) A good reason for this is reflected in the saying, ‘Laziness is like money​—the more one has of it, the more he seems to want it.’</p>

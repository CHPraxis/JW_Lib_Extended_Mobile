Eating like a Bird
● It is commonly believed that birds require very little food to live. In fact, we may say of a person with a small appetite, “He eats like a bird.” But the fact is that birds need to eat a lot to live. A chickadee was observed to eat over 5,500 cankerworm eggs in a day. A robin found and swallowed fifteen worms in an hour. And a flicker feasted on a daily menu of 3,000 ants!
Some young birds consume their own weight in food each day, continuing to do so until six weeks old. A young owl, for example, was observed to devour six mice at one time. So consider a bird’s work of supplying, not only its own daily needs, but also food for a nest full of young ones!

“No Bible Study Is Really Ever Done”
◆ Dr. L. M. Muntingh, head of the department of Bible knowledge at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, commented on the question “Is theological study too long?” In Die Kerkbode (February 4, 1970, page 161), the official church magazine for the Dutch Reformed churches in South Africa, he wrote:
“During the entire course of seven years, no Bible study is really ever done, as every minister can testify. The result is that many a minister’s knowledge of the Afrikaans Bible leaves much to be desired. The result is that his ministry suffers.”

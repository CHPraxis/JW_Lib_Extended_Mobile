Population Problem
● One specialist in the mathematics of populations used Mexico to illustrate what he saw as the glum prospects with regard to the population problem. In the article “The Numbers and Distribution of Mankind” he wrote: “Mexico’s rate of increase would double its present 50 millions in about 21 years; quadruple them in 42 years; multiply them by 8 in 63 years. Thus if the pace continues, a child now born will not yet have retired from active life before Mexico contains 400 million people.” Such estimates, though, overlook the sound Biblical evidence that shortly God is going to intervene in human affairs.

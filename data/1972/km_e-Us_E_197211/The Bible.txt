The Bible
1 What a pleasure it is, not only to direct others to God’s Word for the truth that will set them free, but also to be the one who can place in their hands, at their doorsteps, a copy of the Bible at very small cost. Jehovah has again made it possible for us to concentrate on this work for a full month, December, when the offer will be the New World Translation and the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God?, for $1.25.
2 Since the article “A Bible Society’’ was published in the June Kingdom Ministry, which reminded us that the Society publishes a number of different translations of the Bible, we have noticed that quite a number of congregations have had to order some of these various translations. Apparently, many publishers have kept in mind the suggestion made​—that if the householder shows an interest in the Bible but wants another translation, we should not hesitate to explain what we have to offer, namely, the King James Version for $1.00, the Kingdom Interlinear Translation and the Diaglott at $2.00 each, and the excellent large-print New World Translation for $5.00. Now, of course, we also have Byington’s translation for $6.00. And, for those who read another language, we have the complete New World Translation in Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, as well as the Christian Greek Scriptures in French.
3 Our appreciation for the New World Translation prompts us to encourage people to take this version. However, we are glad to be accommodating and fill requests for other versions in harmony with the interest shown. This could be another step in developing the interest and helping someone on the road to life.

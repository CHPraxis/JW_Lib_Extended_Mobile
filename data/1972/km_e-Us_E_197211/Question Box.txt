Question Box
● When student talks are based on material from the “Guidebook,” how are these to be handled?
Students covering material from the “Guidebook” can use individual initiative to develop these talks in a variety of interesting ways.
At times a sister might discuss the information with her daughter or a new publisher. In that case the assistant could play the role of a student who is working on a particular aspect of progressive speech training. Or the discussion might be slanted to show how the material can be applied in the field ministry, daily conversation or in commenting at meetings. Both the sister giving the talk and her assistant(s) may wish to have the “Guidebook” open during the course of the presentation. Appropriate excerpts might be read directly from the publication.
There being more material than can be covered in six minutes, the sister handling the talk may choose to give brief coverage to all or several points designated by bold-faced headings. Or she may select material from only one section identified by a bold-faced heading, discussing and illustrating this point at greater length.
Brothers assigned student talk No. 5 based on the “Guidebook” will, of course, speak to the entire audience. They, too, are at liberty to use whatever part of the material that they feel can reasonably be covered in the allotted time. When developing material from several bold-faced headings, they may wish to list the key points on a blackboard and thereby gain experience in using visual aids in teaching. The talks may show how the information will benefit the audience in the field ministry, in making comments at meetings, in giving talks or in other aspects of life.

Orders for the English edition of the <em>1973 Yearbook </em>may be placed starting November 15. Please order only after that date. The <em>Yearbook </em>will also be available in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish by about December 15. <em>Yearbooks </em>are 50c each. Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1972, may receive a free <em>Yearbook </em>by making request of the brother handling the literature. This will be included in the congregation’s order and, later, credit may be requested from the Society for the pioneer’s copy. Pioneers may obtain additional copies at 15c each. Calendars are no longer available.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">◆ When supplies of new magazines are received by the congregation, the brother caring for these should make them available to the publishers right away. This will enable the publishers obtaining their copies for personal use from the congregation to read them before they are used in the field ministry.</p>

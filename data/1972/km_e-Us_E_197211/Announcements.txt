◆ When ordering the 1973 Yearbook, publishers and pioneers are requested to do so through the congregation with which they are associated. Orders for the English edition of the 1973 Yearbook may be placed starting November 15. Please order only after that date. The Yearbook will also be available in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish by about December 15. Yearbooks are 50c each. Regular and special pioneers on the list before July 1, 1972, may receive a free Yearbook by making request of the brother handling the literature. This will be included in the congregation’s order and, later, credit may be requested from the Society for the pioneer’s copy. Pioneers may obtain additional copies at 15c each. Calendars are no longer available.
◆ Literature offer:
November: Paradise Restored to Mankind​—By Theocracy!, with a booklet, for 50 cents.
December: New World Translation and Is the Bible Really the Word of God?, for $1.25.
January through April: Watchtower subscription with three booklets for $1.50.
◆ The world’s Thanksgiving holiday falls on Thursday, November 23. Can you arrange to share in the field service on that day?
◆ When supplies of new magazines are received by the congregation, the brother caring for these should make them available to the publishers right away. This will enable the publishers obtaining their copies for personal use from the congregation to read them before they are used in the field ministry.

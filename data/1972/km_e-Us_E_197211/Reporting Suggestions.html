<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It was not possible to tabulate the September field service report because many congregations sent in the old Congregation Report card which only shows the total activity for congregation publishers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ONLY the new Congregation Report cards are to be used in the future. This shows the total activity for congregation publishers, temporary pioneers and regular pioneers. Please discard all old Congregation Report cards. The new report card should be used as follows:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">CONGREGATION PUBLISHERS: Show total number of different congregation publishers reporting along with their total field service activity.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">TEMPORARY PIONEERS: Show the total number of temporary pioneers reporting AND their total field service activity for the month.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">REGULAR PIONEERS: In addition to showing the total regular pioneers reporting and their total activity, their individual pink report cards should be sent to the Society along with the Congregation Report card. In this way the pioneer’s individual activity can be posted on our records here.</p>

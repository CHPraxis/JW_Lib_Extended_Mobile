<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>Advance Insight from the <em>Paradise​—Theocracy </em>Book</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Think back to what you studied in the Theocratic Ministry School during June and July. Do you remember reading and hearing talks on the books of Haggai and Zechariah? Beneficial as that was, it did not answer all our questions about those two Bible books, did it? What a delight it was, then, to receive at the “Divine Rulership” assembly the new book <em>Paradise Restored to Mankind​—By Theocracy! </em>And before the convention concluded we had our urgent question answered, ‘When will we begin studying the new book?’ In December!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But who of us would not benefit from some advance knowledge of its contents as well as insight into how the message in Haggai and Zechariah involves us? Well, we are soon going to be able to gain such advance knowledge and insight, for a special series of seven public talks is planned based on the <em>Paradise​—Theocracy </em>book. Working progressively through the book, the talks will give us a rapid coverage of its contents. This will benefit both us and newly interested ones who attend our meetings.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong><em>You Can Contribute</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These talks will be given at the Kingdom Hall by the elders in the congregation, where possible, or by elders invited from nearby congregations, if this can be arranged. Even though you may not be an elder, you, too, can personally make a valuable contribution to the overall success of this special program. How?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For one thing, as soon as the exact dates for the series in your congregation are announced, you can begin inviting those with whom you are studying and other interested persons. Encourage them not to miss any of the fine material. This is one contribution you can make.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Another contribution involves your preparation. Each talk will cover a few chapters of the <em>Paradise​—Theocracy </em>book, as well as corresponding chapters of Haggai or Zechariah. If at all possible, during the week prior to the meeting read the Bible chapters involved. And, as time permits, also read the corresponding chapters in the new book (which you should bring to the talks). This will greatly increase the benefits that the talks bring to you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Each week as the <em>chairman </em>announces the title of the talk for the following week, it would be beneficial for him to state which Bible chapters are to be covered and which chapters in the new book are involved. That will remind us to make our contribution by preparation.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>When Are the Talks Scheduled?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">We are all intensely interested in the new material. And we will begin using the new book in the congregation book studies starting in December. Hence, it will be best to have the talks as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Some congregations will be able to arrange these seven talks for October and November. That is fine. We encourage you to do so. But if public talks are already lined up for October, and it seems best to the elders to follow through with those arrangements, then we recommend that these special talks be scheduled for November and December. If the congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer or a circuit assembly during that period, the seven talks may be scheduled around such events. In that way the congregation will still benefit fully from all these provisions. When the details have been worked out locally, handbills may be ordered and an announcement should be made to tell the congregation when to expect the talks.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>Arranging for Speakers</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even though we are providing some suggestions as to developing and presenting the material, it will require time and effort to work up the talks. If the local congregation has a sufficient number of elders, this may present no problem, no one being overburdened. But what if that is not the case?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Then, if the local elders desire to do so, they may contact nearby congregations. Perhaps two or three congregations can work out arrangements to share speakers, and, of course, speakers sent to other congregations should all be elders. For example: The brother who has the first talk in the series delivers it in Congregation A. The next week he gives it in Congregation B (where the talks are scheduled a week later than in Congregation A), and the third week in Congregation C. The brother who prepares the second talk gives it the succeeding weeks to each of the three congregations in order. And so on. Consequently, a brother may not have to prepare more than one of these talks, and more than one congregation will benefit from his preparation. Also, in this way each congregation will hear the talks in their proper sequence.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong><em>Preparing the Talks</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As you will see from the following outlines, each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>from two to four chapters of the book. Hence, if you deliver one of the talks you simply cannot cover all the excellent points in the assigned portion of the <em>Paradise​—Theocracy </em>book. Nor will you be able to read and explain every verse in the portion of the Bible that your talk considers. It is necessary to be selective if the audience is going to get the overall view as well as the thrust or application of your talk.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The outlines will help. When you know which talk you are to give, read over the outline to fix in mind the direction that it should take. Next read the portion of the Bible that you will be covering, and then consider carefully the assigned chapters of the book.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">You will observe that we focus attention on selected paragraphs and texts. The surrounding material in the book will help you to get the setting. But in your talk we encourage you to deal with just the paragraphs highlighted in the outline. The scriptures cited in the outline are meant to be read. Keep in mind the theme. This will be a challenge, but to the extent that you succeed, the audience will benefit.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In a couple of cases we refer the speaker to a paragraph outside the chapters of the book he is assigned. This is so a <em>brief </em>comment on the historical situation being dealt with in Haggai and Zechariah can be made. But such ought to be very limited, as other talks in the series deal more extensively with this. It is brought in merely so you can give the background or setting of the material you will present.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Occasionally you may want to call attention to a particular paragraph in the book. Perhaps you will even arrange for a qualified person in the audience to read a portion of the book or some Bible verses. In addition, give thought to whether use of a blackboard or a few review questions at some appropriate point in your talk will help the audience to fix the information in mind.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The brothers in the congregation will be looking forward to your talk. By your careful and thoughtful preparation it will prove to be, we feel certain, a real blessing.</p>

Paradise Restored​—How? </strong>(<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1101972011/1-5:429$p/E:1101972012/$p/E:1101972013/"><strong>pm </strong>chapters 1-3;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:1-37:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1-15</a>)</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><em>We have valid reason to hope for restoration of paradise. </em>(Chap. 1; 15 min.) Desirability of paradise is undeniable; is a basic idea behind concern about ecology and pollution. Is not a mere idle dream. One valid reason for such a hope is that Jesus confirmed that an earthly paradise once existed. (Pars. 4-7, 11) Proves the accuracy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:14-1:2:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>. (Read from <em>Douay </em>or par. 12.) Involved same general area where Jews were later in exile. (Par. 13) Jesus also promised restoration of paradise. (Pars. 16, 17; explain how he “will be with” evildoer.) Hope valid, too, because paradise is God’s purpose. (Pars. 21-23) Though he did away with first paradise after humans lost right to be in it, God gave prophetic illustration of his ability to produce paradise conditions again. (Par. 31; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 35:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 5-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:10-23:35:10" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10</a>) History thus proves his blessing is the prime factor, not human technology.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><em>Example of Jews who returned from exile shows that enjoyment of paradise is dependent on putting true worship first. </em>(Chap. 2; 20 min.) God’s blessing is needed, for he controls even weather. Must give due attention to true worship to gain his blessing. See this with Jews who returned. (Pars. 3-6) They left off work on temple they had returned to rebuild. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:1-37:1:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1, 2</a>; pars. 15-19) Instead, were attending to their own material interests. But rather than prospering and enjoying paradisaic conditions, they came into want. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:3-37:1:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hag. 1:3-6</a>) Problem was they did not put true worship first; as a result they lacked God’s blessing. (Pars. 24-26) Should be an advisory example for us, who are hoping for restored paradise.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><em>God will definitely restore paradise, for those obeying him as ruler. </em>(Chap. 3; 20 min.) God stressed that proper action is required to reverse one’s unblessed condition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:7-37:1:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hag. 1:7</a>; gist of vss. 8-11) Is not easy; it may be contrary to will of someone with authority or influence over you​—husband, parents, employer, school officials, government. Jews were in similar situation. (Par. 4) Yet they obeyed God as ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:12-37:1:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hag. 1:12-14</a>; pars. 14-17) Same is required of Christians who look to God for restored paradise. We even find a modern-day parallel in spiritual “Israel of God.” (Pars. 20-23) Public witnessing of anointed halted in 1918, as if captive in spiritual Babylon. In 1919 they reoccupied right spiritual estate. (Par. 27) Despite bans on literature, needed to obey God and give spiritual temple first place. They responded, having leadership and service of Greater Zerubbabel and the one foreshadowed by High Priest Joshua. (Pars. 30, 34, 35) We too must obey God as ruler and depend on him. Men will not restore paradise​—He will! Our obedient attention to true worship will assure our enjoying that paradise.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><em>Nations will be rocked into destruction, yet we can have hope. </em>(Chap. 4; 20 min.) Many despair over mankind’s future; overlook real reason wicked system will end​—God’s disapproval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:1-19:127:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1</a>) What he approves and blesses will remain, as illustrated with Jews.

(Pars. 42-44; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:11-66:20:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 20:11</a>) Ungodly human society first shaken by being notified. Rocking finally means destruction. (Pars. 45, 46, 48, 50, 52) But we can have hope, for Kingdom and God’s spiritual temple will remain.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><em>Join now in worshiping at the temple that will remain. </em>(Chap. 5; 10 min.) Prior to shaking of nations to destruction, “desirable things” come in.

(Par. 37) Will survive with it.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><em>God requires fearless, wholehearted worship. </em>(Chap. 6; 10 min.) God also raised up Zechariah to strengthen Jews. (Par. 2) May have been lag in temple building; urged to “return.” Needed to be fearless, wholehearted to gain His full favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:3-38:1:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Zech. 1:3, 4</a>; pars. 9-12) Similar in modern parallel; anointed feared men.

(Pars. 6-8) Such protection is available to all siding with God’s ruler.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><em>Siding with God’s ruler involves accepting his judgments. </em>(Chap. 14; 10 min.) Many feel God’s standards too strict or that executional work at Armageddon is cruel. One siding with God’s ruler will not resist or mourn over his judgments.

(Gist of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:3-38:7:6" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Zech. 7:3-6</a>; pars. 4-6) God did not expect that; Jews were really fasting or eating for themselves.

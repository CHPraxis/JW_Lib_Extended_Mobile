<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Elders:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">September is a month when significant changes will be taking place in the congregations, and you are privileged to have a share in these. It is recommended that the entire body of elders meet together early in September. And we suggest that before that meeting each of you study carefully Chapter 4 of the <em>Organization </em>book, on “Shepherds of the Flock of God,” so as to have clearly in mind what needs to be done.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you have not already done so, at this meeting you will decide who is to conduct the various congregation book studies for the year to come, and assignments of duties should be worked out for the ministerial servants. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1972002/53-57:1117"><em>The Watchtower, </em>January 1, 1972, pages 25, 26</a>.) Lists also need to be drawn up of brothers who may be used to read paragraphs at the <em>Watchtower </em>study and of those who could serve well as chairmen at public meetings.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One of the special responsibilities of elders is teaching, and much of this is done in congregation meetings. Discuss what can be done to improve the meetings locally. You need to plan together your public meetings, deciding what subjects will be covered in the months ahead and who will give the talks. Decide, too, which instruction talks you brothers will deliver at the ministry school, and what matters need special attention on the service meetings. Brothers, never lose sight of the fact that your aiding all in the congregation to benefit fully from the “food” provided on the “table of Jehovah” is a key factor in their spiritual growth and health. Accomplishing this also requires personal attention to members of the “flock,” so at your meeting take time to discuss any situations needing attention and decide who of the elders can care for these.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In harmony with what was said at the district assembles, the preaching of the good news and the making of disciples should be vigorously promoted in every congregation. The field overseer and the Bible study overseer bear special responsibility in this regard, but all who are elders are keenly interested in it. We encourage you to discuss it together, to make definite plans and to aid the congregation to appreciate fully the grand privilege that is theirs to be public witnesses of Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The September field service report for the congregation will be the first one submitted to the Society by the new presiding overseer, and he should be sure to have it in the mail no later than October 6. This year the outgoing presiding overseer does not need to send in a comprehensive report on the condition of the congregation and the work it has done during the past year, but that will be done next September. However, it would be appreciated if, without delay, the congregations would put into operation the new arrangement for handling applications for temporary pioneer service, doing this locally.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It is a grand privilege to serve under the direction of Jesus Christ, the appointed Head of the congregation, sharing with him in promoting respect for the divine name and in providing loving care for all the “flock of God.” May Jehovah bless you richly as you freely give of yourselves in doing so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:8-52:2:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 2:8</a>.</p>

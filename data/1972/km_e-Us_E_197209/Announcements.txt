Announcements

(The Society has 15,300 “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” 29,900 “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” and 13,500 “The Kingdom Is at Hand” books in stock. Your orders will be filled with these books as long as they last.) November: Paradise Restored to Mankind​—By Theocracy! for 50c.
◆ Congregation accounts should be audited soon after September 1.
◆ Now that elders will be the only speakers sent out to other congregations, the elders of nearby congregations may find it beneficial to check with one another to find out which talks have already been prepared by someone, and they may want to coordinate their assigning of new talks. In this way the best use can be made of each talk that is prepared, thus saving much time.
◆ New publications available:
“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!​—Italian
Listening to the Great Teacher​—Spanish
When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God​—Italian
◆ A supply of forms is being sent to the congregations. When more are needed they may be requested with literature orders. A new form, Theocratic Ministry School Assignment Slip, is now available at 80c a thousand.
◆ In cities where there are more than one congregation (formerly units) these will continue to use the congregation number already designated for their use, such as, U1, U5, etc. In filling out forms, the full name of the congregation and the congregation number should always be used.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you ever been discouraged after several hours in the house-to-house work or in making return visits because you found very few persons at home or talked to only a few individuals? Do you feel as if you have not accomplished much if you place only a few magazines or tracts in an entire morning? Really, we should not be discouraged. Why? If we have been faithful and have persevered in doing Jehovah’s will, he is pleased with our service. Further, we cannot completely control our placements or ensure that people will be at home when we call. But to a large degree we can control the time and effort we put forth in Kingdom activity.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jehovah is directing His work and it is his will that people everywhere be given the opportunity to hear the good news. Indeed, the time left in which to reach people in our territory with this good news is short. As we preach, persons may watch us but not talk to us. Others may not open the door, but they realize who is calling and sometimes are favorably impressed with our faith and devotion. However, even if the householder is not interested, are we not giving a witness? Indeed we are.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Perhaps, because of physical limitations, your field activity may be restricted to street work, letter writing or informal witnessing. Do not think for a moment that your work is in vain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) Often favorable comments are heard by others going from door to door because of your good conduct and your fine works. Solomon stated: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:6-21:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>How vital it is, then, to be patient and persevere in doing Jehovah’s will. The main thing today is to be totally involved in doing that will, totally committed to Jehovah’s righteous cause.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">◆ Now that elders will be the only speakers sent out to other congregations, the elders of nearby congregations may find it beneficial to check with one another to find out which talks have already been prepared by someone, and they may want to coordinate their assigning of new talks. In this way the best use can be made of each talk that is prepared, thus saving much time.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si"><em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!​</em>—Italian</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">◆ In cities where there are more than one congregation (formerly units) these will continue to use the congregation number already designated for their use, such as, U1, U5, etc. In filling out forms, the full name of the congregation and the congregation number should always be used.</p>

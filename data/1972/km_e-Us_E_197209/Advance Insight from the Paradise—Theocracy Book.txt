Advance Insight from the Paradise​—Theocracy Book
Think back to what you studied in the Theocratic Ministry School during June and July. Do you remember reading and hearing talks on the books of Haggai and Zechariah? Beneficial as that was, it did not answer all our questions about those two Bible books, did it? What a delight it was, then, to receive at the “Divine Rulership” assembly the new book Paradise Restored to Mankind​—By Theocracy! And before the convention concluded we had our urgent question answered, ‘When will we begin studying the new book?’ In December!
But who of us would not benefit from some advance knowledge of its contents as well as insight into how the message in Haggai and Zechariah involves us? Well, we are soon going to be able to gain such advance knowledge and insight, for a special series of seven public talks is planned based on the Paradise​—Theocracy book. Working progressively through the book, the talks will give us a rapid coverage of its contents. This will benefit both us and newly interested ones who attend our meetings.
You Can Contribute
These talks will be given at the Kingdom Hall by the elders in the congregation, where possible, or by elders invited from nearby congregations, if this can be arranged. Even though you may not be an elder, you, too, can personally make a valuable contribution to the overall success of this special program. How?
For one thing, as soon as the exact dates for the series in your congregation are announced, you can begin inviting those with whom you are studying and other interested persons. Encourage them not to miss any of the fine material. This is one contribution you can make.
Another contribution involves your preparation. Each talk will cover a few chapters of the Paradise​—Theocracy book, as well as corresponding chapters of Haggai or Zechariah. If at all possible, during the week prior to the meeting read the Bible chapters involved. And, as time permits, also read the corresponding chapters in the new book (which you should bring to the talks). This will greatly increase the benefits that the talks bring to you.
Each week as the chairman announces the title of the talk for the following week, it would be beneficial for him to state which Bible chapters are to be covered and which chapters in the new book are involved. That will remind us to make our contribution by preparation.
When Are the Talks Scheduled?
We are all intensely interested in the new material. And we will begin using the new book in the congregation book studies starting in December. Hence, it will be best to have the talks as soon as possible.
Some congregations will be able to arrange these seven talks for October and November. That is fine. We encourage you to do so. But if public talks are already lined up for October, and it seems best to the elders to follow through with those arrangements, then we recommend that these special talks be scheduled for November and December. If the congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer or a circuit assembly during that period, the seven talks may be scheduled around such events. In that way the congregation will still benefit fully from all these provisions. When the details have been worked out locally, handbills may be ordered and an announcement should be made to tell the congregation when to expect the talks.
Arranging for Speakers
Even though we are providing some suggestions as to developing and presenting the material, it will require time and effort to work up the talks. If the local congregation has a sufficient number of elders, this may present no problem, no one being overburdened. But what if that is not the case?
Then, if the local elders desire to do so, they may contact nearby congregations. Perhaps two or three congregations can work out arrangements to share speakers, and, of course, speakers sent to other congregations should all be elders. For example: The brother who has the first talk in the series delivers it in Congregation A. The next week he gives it in Congregation B (where the talks are scheduled a week later than in Congregation A), and the third week in Congregation C. The brother who prepares the second talk gives it the succeeding weeks to each of the three congregations in order. And so on. Consequently, a brother may not have to prepare more than one of these talks, and more than one congregation will benefit from his preparation. Also, in this way each congregation will hear the talks in their proper sequence.
Preparing the Talks
As you will see from the following outlines, each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, from two to four chapters of the book. Hence, if you deliver one of the talks you simply cannot cover all the excellent points in the assigned portion of the Paradise​—Theocracy book. Nor will you be able to read and explain every verse in the portion of the Bible that your talk considers. It is necessary to be selective if the audience is going to get the overall view as well as the thrust or application of your talk.
The outlines will help. When you know which talk you are to give, read over the outline to fix in mind the direction that it should take. Next read the portion of the Bible that you will be covering, and then consider carefully the assigned chapters of the book.
You will observe that we focus attention on selected paragraphs and texts. The surrounding material in the book will help you to get the setting. But in your talk we encourage you to deal with just the paragraphs highlighted in the outline. The scriptures cited in the outline are meant to be read. Keep in mind the theme. This will be a challenge, but to the extent that you succeed, the audience will benefit.
In a couple of cases we refer the speaker to a paragraph outside the chapters of the book he is assigned. This is so a brief comment on the historical situation being dealt with in Haggai and Zechariah can be made. But such ought to be very limited, as other talks in the series deal more extensively with this. It is brought in merely so you can give the background or setting of the material you will present.
Occasionally you may want to call attention to a particular paragraph in the book. Perhaps you will even arrange for a qualified person in the audience to read a portion of the book or some Bible verses. In addition, give thought to whether use of a blackboard or a few review questions at some appropriate point in your talk will help the audience to fix the information in mind.
The brothers in the congregation will be looking forward to your talk. By your careful and thoughtful preparation it will prove to be, we feel certain, a real blessing.
1. Paradise Restored​—How? (pm chapters 1-3; Hag. 1:1-15)
We have valid reason to hope for restoration of paradise. (Chap. 1; 15 min.) Desirability of paradise is undeniable; is a basic idea behind concern about ecology and pollution. Is not a mere idle dream. One valid reason for such a hope is that Jesus confirmed that an earthly paradise once existed. (Pars. 4-7, 11) Proves the accuracy of Genesis 2:7-10, 14. (Read from Douay or par. 12.) Involved same general area where Jews were later in exile. (Par. 13) Jesus also promised restoration of paradise. (Pars. 16, 17; explain how he “will be with” evildoer.) Hope valid, too, because paradise is God’s purpose. (Pars. 21-23) Though he did away with first paradise after humans lost right to be in it, God gave prophetic illustration of his ability to produce paradise conditions again. (Par. 31; Isa. 35:1, 2, 5-7, 10) History thus proves his blessing is the prime factor, not human technology.
Example of Jews who returned from exile shows that enjoyment of paradise is dependent on putting true worship first. (Chap. 2; 20 min.) God’s blessing is needed, for he controls even weather. Must give due attention to true worship to gain his blessing. See this with Jews who returned. (Pars. 3-6) They left off work on temple they had returned to rebuild. (Hag. 1:1, 2; pars. 15-19) Instead, were attending to their own material interests. But rather than prospering and enjoying paradisaic conditions, they came into want. (Hag. 1:3-6) Problem was they did not put true worship first; as a result they lacked God’s blessing. (Pars. 24-26) Should be an advisory example for us, who are hoping for restored paradise.
God will definitely restore paradise, for those obeying him as ruler. (Chap. 3; 20 min.) God stressed that proper action is required to reverse one’s unblessed condition. (Hag. 1:7; gist of vss. 8-11) Is not easy; it may be contrary to will of someone with authority or influence over you​—husband, parents, employer, school officials, government. Jews were in similar situation. (Par. 4) Yet they obeyed God as ruler. (Hag. 1:12-14; pars. 14-17) Same is required of Christians who look to God for restored paradise. We even find a modern-day parallel in spiritual “Israel of God.” (Pars. 20-23) Public witnessing of anointed halted in 1918, as if captive in spiritual Babylon. In 1919 they reoccupied right spiritual estate. (Par. 27) Despite bans on literature, needed to obey God and give spiritual temple first place. They responded, having leadership and service of Greater Zerubbabel and the one foreshadowed by High Priest Joshua. (Pars. 30, 34, 35) We too must obey God as ruler and depend on him. Men will not restore paradise​—He will! Our obedient attention to true worship will assure our enjoying that paradise.
2. God’s Temple Remains as the Nations Are Rocked (pm chapters 4-7; Hag. 2:1-23; Zech. 1:1-6)
Nations will be rocked into destruction, yet we can have hope. (Chap. 4; 20 min.) Many despair over mankind’s future; overlook real reason wicked system will end​—God’s disapproval. (Ps. 127:1) What he approves and blesses will remain, as illustrated with Jews. (Briefly: pm 246, par. 18) Had reason for courage; God was backing. (Hag. 2:4, 5; pars. 8, 9) Would complete and inaugurate that temple. (Hag. 2:6, 7; pars. 12, 13) Was reminder of Mount Sinai and tabernacle. (Gist of Ex. 19:16-19; pars. 18-20) Larger, more serious fulfillment of Haggai 2:6 involves Kingdom and God’s spiritual temple. (Heb. 12:25-28; pars. 27, 33-38) Wicked spiritual heavens shaken after 1914; will yet be destroyed. (Pars. 42-44; Rev. 20:11) Ungodly human society first shaken by being notified. Rocking finally means destruction. (Pars. 45, 46, 48, 50, 52) But we can have hope, for Kingdom and God’s spiritual temple will remain.
Join now in worshiping at the temple that will remain. (Chap. 5; 10 min.) Prior to shaking of nations to destruction, “desirable things” come in. (Hag. 2:7; pars. 4, 5) Fulfills Isaiah 2:2-4; not spiritual Israelites, but “nations.” (Pars. 8, 10, 11) Worship “in his temple.” (Rev. 7:9, 15a) Not in courtyard where Israelite priests served, but Court of Gentiles. (Par. 15) God protects them. (Rev. 7:15b; pars. 16, 17) Zerubbabel’s temple was more glorious than Solomon’s. However, both picture glorious spiritual temple, Most Holy of which is God’s place in heaven. (Hag. 2:9; Heb. 9:23, 24; pars. 23-26) While a spiritual son on earth Jesus served in Holy of this temple and in courtyard for priests. Resurrected into Most Holy. (Pars. 27, 28) Anointed on earth also serve in Holy and in courtyard for priests. (Par. 30) Both they and “other sheep” enjoy peace now in spiritual temple. (Par. 37) Will survive with it.
God requires fearless, wholehearted worship. (Chap. 6; 10 min.) God also raised up Zechariah to strengthen Jews. (Par. 2) May have been lag in temple building; urged to “return.” Needed to be fearless, wholehearted to gain His full favor. (Zech. 1:3, 4; pars. 9-12) Similar in modern parallel; anointed feared men. (Par. 17) After 1919 fearlessly and wholeheartedly ‘turned’ to work; He ‘returned’ to them with favor. (Pars. 32, 33) All who hope to survive coming “rocking” must render fearless, wholehearted worship.
Those rendering clean worship are blessed. (Chap. 7; 15 min.) A spiritually clean person can become unclean. (Hag. 2:13; pars. 4, 8) One indifferent toward temple could not render clean sacrifices; must do building work. (Pars. 9, 12) Similarly, anointed needed to be cleansed of fear of men and indifference. (Pars. 13, 16) Blessings followed. (Hag. 2:19; pars. 19, 20) Also, when God rocks the nations, His people will be protected. (Gist of Hag. 2:21, 22; pars. 26, 27, 32) Zerubbabel like a seal ring, precious to God; Jesus now precious leader. (Hag. 2:23; pars. 36-39) Rendering clean worship, you will not be shaken with nations.
3. How Jehovah Prospers His People (pm chapters 8-10; Zech. 1:7–3:10)
Jehovah prospers his people by showing them mercy. (Chap. 8; 20 min.) Prosperity dependent on God’s favor. Can reverse one’s condition from poverty to prosperity. God is willing to display mercy, as shown with Jews who returned to build temple. (Briefly: pm 92, par. 1) Other nations considered Jerusalem no source of concern to them. (Zech. 1:8-12; pars. 12, 17) But God was no longer displeased; time had come for reconstruction, and nothing would stop it. (Zech. 1:13-17; pars. 25, 27, 28) Nations had abused, persecuted God’s people; he promised mercy. (Pars. 30, 31) In modern times, dealt similarly with anointed ones ruled by Greater Zerubbabel from heavenly Mount Zion. (Par. 33) Were persecuted and as if abandoned, but God has “returned”; shown mercy, so congregations thrive. (Pars. 37-40) Also comforts people with promise to smash persecutors.​—Zech. 1:18-21; pars. 42, 46, 48, 50-53.
God prospers his people by protecting them. (Chap. 9; 20 min.) Real prosperity is possible only if life and possessions are protected. To be expected that God would protect those who make up his capital organization. (Pars. 5-7, 12, 17) Promised “wall” of protection for spiritual Jerusalem to help his people to grow. (Zech. 2:1-5; pars. 22, 26, 30-33) He is sensitive over his servants. (Zech. 2:8; par. 45) Invites persons of all nations to join with prosperous, protected servants. (Zech. 2:10-12) God safeguarded “holy ground” for exiled Jews; also restored anointed remnant to their land. (Pars. 56-59) Spiritual prosperity proves he is ‘residing’ with them. People of nations have joined with spiritual Israelites; having hope of earthly life.​—Pars. 61-65.
God helps his people to keep clean, so they enjoy prosperity. (Chap. 10; 15 min.) Logically expect opposition and obstacles to spiritual prosperity. Satan is opposed, as he was to Joshua’s efforts regarding temple. (Zech. 3:1, 2; pars. 6, 7) Joshua typified Jesus. (Pars. 2-4) Uncleanness in God’s sight is an obstacle to prosperity. Joshua “unclean” in that people he represented had neglected temple work. (Zech. 3:3, 4; pars. 13, 14) Similar with remnant for a time. (Pars. 15, 17) Clean priesthood portends greater priesthood of “Sprout.” (Zech. 3:8-10; pars. 32-35) “Stone” in place guarantees completed temple; pictures Messiah, who is topstone in Jehovah’s system of worship. (Pars. 36-40, 43) Prosperity to result produces peace now and leads to eternal life.​—Par. 45.
4. Have You Really Sided with the Ruler God Upholds? (pm chapters 11-14; Zech. 4:1–7:14)
A ruler God supports accomplishes outstanding things. (Chap. 11; 15 min.) People oppressed by corrupt ruler often have no power to resist. (Prov. 29:2) God backs a righteous ruler for whole earth. Foreshadowed by his support of Zerubbabel. (Briefly: pm 240, par. 4) Jews’ efforts to rebuild temple under Zerubbabel faced “mountain” of obstacles. But God backed Zerubbabel with spirit to ‘level’ opposition. (Zech. 4:6-9; pars. 10-15) Temple would be completed, headstone added. In modern times, Greater Zerubbabel stimulated work of restoring worship at spiritual temple despite opposition. (Pars. 21-24) God’s spirit (oil) illustratively shown to be vital. (Zech. 4:1-3, 11-14; pars. 31, 32) Zerubbabel and Joshua imbued nation with spirit; Jesus channels it to Christians who recognize him as ruler.​—Pars. 34-36.
Siding with God’s chosen ruler requires rejecting wickedness. (Chap. 12; 15 min.) Not sufficient to recognize God’s ruler; must also reject wickedness. (Par. 2) Zechariah 5:1-4 shows thieves and false swearers are cursed. Thievery (a form of idolatry) even includes distorting Bible teachings. (Pars. 12-14, 18) Oath-breaking clergy claim to side with God and Jesus, but have broken covenant. We cannot be like them. (Pars. 22-25) Wickedness must be removed from God’s people. (Zech. 5:5-11) Not endured among Jews, but relegated to Babylon. (Pars. 30, 32, 35) God to collect wicked out from his servants. (Pars. 38, 39) We must uphold that view to side truly with him and his chosen ruler.
Divine protection extends to those on earth siding with God’s ruler. (Chap. 13; 15 min.) Have already seen that God upholds Jesus, as He did Zerubbabel, but will that mean protection for humans? Next vision answers. (Zech. 6:1-5) Chariots represent bands of angels who protect God’s people. (Pars. 5, 9) Issue from between kingships of God and Jesus. Since each is a king having rulership, can be portrayed as two kingdoms. (Pars. 6-8) Such protection is available to all siding with God’s ruler. (Gist of Zech. 6:6, 7; pars. 11, 12, 16) Protected ones today will witness grand finish of temple work. Joshua typified Jesus, Priest-King who has carried on temple work since 1919. (Zech. 6:11-13, 15; pars. 22, 23) Increasing numbers come to temple of pure worship. Their estate is protected; will survive coming tribulation.​—Pars. 26-30.
Siding with God’s ruler involves accepting his judgments. (Chap. 14; 10 min.) Many feel God’s standards too strict or that executional work at Armageddon is cruel. One siding with God’s ruler will not resist or mourn over his judgments. Jews mourned over expressions of divine judgment. (Gist of Zech. 7:3-6; pars. 4-6) God did not expect that; Jews were really fasting or eating for themselves. Should have left badness and done good. (Zech. 7:7-11) We should not mourn because anointed were disciplined in past nor resist other judgments from God or his ruler. (Par. 13) Siding with ruler involves supporting him to receive in turn his support.
5. Peace to All Who Listen to What Jehovah Has Said (pm chapters 15-17; Zech. 8:1–10:12)
True peace linked with listening to Jehovah. (Chap. 15; 20 min.) Politicians say they will bring peace; those who listen to them are disappointed​—no permanent peace. God is only reliable source of peace. (Ps. 29:11) Seen in dealings with Jews returned from exile. (Par. 4) Listen to what Jehovah has said: Zion to become place of true worship. (Zech. 8:3; par. 6) People to have peace. God has done similarly for anointed since restoration. (Zech. 8:4, 5; pars. 8-10) Not too difficult for God. (Zech. 8:6; par. 12) However, reversal of condition surprises observers. (Zech. 8:11-13; pars. 21, 22) Maintaining peace involves proper conduct. (Zech. 8:16, 17) Ask: ‘Do I listen to what God has said on such matters, and act accordingly?’ Today people of many nations desire peace; listen to Jehovah and join with spiritual Jews. (Zech. 8:20-23; pars. 34-39, 44) But what happens to those who do not listen to what God says?
Make your choice​—peace or war. (Chap. 16; 20 min.) In ancient example, God foretold calamity for Syria, Phoenicia. (Gist of Zech. 9:1-5; pars. 5, 6, 8-10) Philistia condemned, but a remnant chose peace with God. (Zech. 9:6-8; pars. 14-17) Today some have also left bloodlusting gods and chosen pence and protection as true worshipers. (Pars. 19-22) Zechariah 9:9, 10, regarding peace, fulfilled in Jesus. (Pars. 25, 28) Brings peace to God’s people; war to opposers. (Par. 29) Anointed, not Christendom, have chosen him as King. (Pars. 30-33) Peace is assured anointed, for God defends them. (Zech. 9:15; pars. 46, 47) He is their tender, peaceful shepherd.​—Zech. 9:16, 17; pars. 48-51.
Those who listen to Jehovah enjoy further blessings. (Chap. 17; 15 min.) In contrast to calamity of those opposing God, Jews were blessed with life-giving rain. (Zech. 10:1; pars. 4-6) Likewise, God has given anointed increased spiritual blessings. (Par. 7) Such are not for persons following worldly “shepherds.” (Zech. 10:3; pars. 11-14) Anciently, exiles from all twelve tribes were reunited in their land. (Zech. 10:6, 7; pars. 19-21) Similarly, anointed, older and newer parts, blessed with unity. (Pars. 23, 24) Regathered worshipers “become many” with his blessing. (Zech. 10:8: pars. 31, 33-35) Listening to what Jehovah has said, they have overcome all obstacles. (Zech. 10:12; par. 40) All must continue listening and obeying to enjoy peace.
6. How Much Does God’s Shepherd Mean to You? (pm chapters 18-20; Zech. 11:1–13:9)
Vital that we appreciate Jehovah’s chosen shepherd. (Chap. 18; 20 min.) Humans sorely need reliable leader or shepherd who will treat them properly. Most persons lack appreciation for God’s shepherd. Rulers aptly likened to shepherds. (Pars. 1, 8) Ancient “shepherds” mistreated people over whom God was Great Shepherd. (Zech. 11:4, 5; pars. 10, 11) Similarly, clergy have treated as “flock meant for the killing” people who look to them. (Pars. 12-15) God used Zechariah as shepherd; pictured Jesus. (Zech. 11:7, 8; pars. 20, 21, 28-31) Jesus dismissed three classes improperly shepherding people. (Pars. 32, 33) Most persons undervalued Jesus as shepherd. (Zech. 11:12, 13; pars. 37-44, 48) Christendom, professing love for Jesus, actually rejects him; persecutes his servants, refuses their message. (Par. 50) Test for us: Do we value more highly Jesus and his kingdom, or promises and guidance of human leaders? Vital to decide now.​—Zech. 11:15-17; pars. 51, 54-56.
Lack of appreciation for Jesus leads to annihilation. (Chap. 19; 20 min.) Further proof that Christendom does not appreciate shepherd (Jesus) portrayed in next chapter. Spiritual Jerusalem is object of attack. (Zech. 12:1-4; pars. 3-6) After Kingdom established, spiritual Judeans came under siege, but attackers got ‘scratched.’ (Pars. 10-13) Though anointed seem “open” for attack, attackers will be annihilated. (Zech. 12:7, 9; pars. 19-22) Those attacked and preserved deeply appreciate Jesus. (Zech. 12:10; pars. 30-32) They know he is shepherd of God’s people; determined to look to and follow him.
Jehovah’s shepherd helps to cleanse God’s people. (Chap. 20; 15 min.) Should have intense love for Jesus. His sacrifice makes possible our cleansing from sin; represented by “well” in Zechariah 13:1. Showed a need for divine provision for cleansing. (Pars. 4-8) Anointed restored in 1919, cleansed. (Pars. 11-13) Shepherd did not abandon them. Early disciples “scattered” but protected; similar with modern anointed. (Zech. 13:7; pars. 29-33) Those not faithful to God and his shepherd cut off when temple inspected. Imitation “weed” Christians and “evil slave” cut off from spiritual estate of God’s people; minority preserved. (Zech. 13:8, 9; pars. 34, 39-45) Faithful continue to look to God, approaching through ransomer Jesus. “Great crowd,” too, await time when shepherd leads them to human perfection and eternal life.
7. Theocracy’s Triumph Ushers In Paradise (pm chapters 21, 22; Zech. 14:1-21)
Jehovah’s rulership will triumph over defiant nations. (Chap. 21; 30 min.) Witnesses have long preached coming war between God and nations; not imagination, but based on Bible. With evidence of “last days” mounting, interested in details of that war. Involves attack on representatives of heavenly Jerusalem. (Zech. 14:2a, 3; pars. 3, 4) Nations “became wrathful,” persecuting remnant; actually warring against Kingdom. (Rev. 11:15, 18; pars. 11-15, 18) Final attack yet to come. (Par. 20) There is a provision for protection. Jehovah and Jesus are both kings; their kingdoms likened to two parts of mountain that splits, offering protection. (Zech. 14:3-5; pars. 23-34) Will be darkness and cold for defiant nations, but light for one upholding theocracy. (Zech. 14:6, 7; pars. 35-38) “Living waters” provided for “great crowd” and dead. (Zech. 14:8; pars. 42-45) God known earth wide. (Zech. 14:9; pars. 52, 53) Defiant abusers of God’s name wiped out; whether “scourge” literal or not, their end is sure. (Zech. 14:12, 13; pars. 57-60) Thus theocracy triumphs.
A paradise for those rejoicing in true worship. (Chap. 22; 25 min.) Elimination of defiant nations opens way for paradise. Jesus indicated evildoer would get this by resurrection. (Luke 23:43; pars. 3, 4) Survivors will work to restore paradise, though spiritual paradise takes precedence. (Pars. 5, 6) Resurrected will have to take up true worship; cannot be indifferent. (Zech. 14:16-19; pars. 7, 10, 11) Festival of Mosaic law not celebrated, but people will rejoice in Jesus’ sacrifice and Kingdom provisions. (Pars. 14-16) All things will serve to praise of God. (Zech. 14:20, 21; pars. 18-21) Ones continuing in paradise will not be interested in commercial profit, but in true worship. (Pars. 25, 26) Seventh creative day closes with earth a paradise; all worship the Theocrat.​—Par. 29.

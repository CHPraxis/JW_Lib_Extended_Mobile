How Did We Do in July?
Jehovah’s people are unique in their resolve to stand firm for divine rulership. During July this was shown not only by the fine attendance at the district assemblies, but also by our public ministry in behalf of Jehovah’s kingdom rule.
It has been four years since the “Truth” book was first published. In spite of its wide distribution throughout our territories, during July we placed 682,596 books, well over 100,000 more than during the same period last year. Truly Jehovah is richly blessing the work of his servants!

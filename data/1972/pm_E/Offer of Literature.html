No doubt that is how you have felt as you have read this book along with your copy of the Bible. Perhaps the things that you have learned are causing you to take a completely different viewpoint of life. That is how God’s Word affects a person of honest heart. If it has affected you in that way, you will no doubt want to share it with others. To assist you, we will be glad to provide you with additional copies of this book at $1.50 each, to be sent, postpaid, either to you or to wherever you direct. (Contribution subject to change.)</p>

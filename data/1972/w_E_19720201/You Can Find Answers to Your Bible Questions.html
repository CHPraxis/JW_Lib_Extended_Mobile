<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The only way you can really get to know your Bible is by finding satisfactory answers to questions that arise as you read it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You can find those answers in the <strong>Watchtower </strong>magazine and other Bible study aids of the Watch Tower Society. Locating the answers is not difficult when you use the <strong>Watch Tower Publications Index </strong>for 1966-1970 and the <strong>Index </strong>for 1971. The hardbound five-year index can be obtained for $1 and the one-year index for only 10c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me the <em>Index </em>to publications of the Watch Tower Society​—five-year index [ ] and/​or one-year index [ ], for which I enclose ($1), ($1.10) or (10c). I have checked what I want.</p>

You Can Find Answers to Your Bible Questions
The only way you can really get to know your Bible is by finding satisfactory answers to questions that arise as you read it.
You can find those answers in the Watchtower magazine and other Bible study aids of the Watch Tower Society. Locating the answers is not difficult when you use the Watch Tower Publications Index for 1966-1970 and the Index for 1971. The hardbound five-year index can be obtained for $1 and the one-year index for only 10c.
Please send me the Index to publications of the Watch Tower Society​—five-year index [ ] and/​or one-year index [ ], for which I enclose ($1), ($1.10) or (10c). I have checked what I want.

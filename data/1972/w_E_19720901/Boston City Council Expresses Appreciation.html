<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY people appreciate the work of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses and admire their zeal and devotion. Some are even moved to voice their feelings publicly. This recently happened in the city of Boston.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On May 28, 1972, the president of the Boston City Council, Mr. Gabriel Francis Piemonte, was walking his dog outside his home. Two ladies and a man approached him, introducing themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses. They left him the current issues of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Later Mr. Piemonte saw four other Witnesses sharing in the same activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Impressed by their dedication, interest and goal, he took the liberty to introduce an order in the Boston City Council on June 5. The order was unanimously adopted and read:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“CITY OF BOSTON “IN CITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“WHEREAS, volunteer representatives of the Jehovah’s Witnesses are currently engaged in a program of promoting the reading of the Bible; and</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“WHEREAS, the Bible affords a source of comfort, understanding, and an enlightenment of civilization; and</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“WHEREAS, in their door-to-door program the Jehovah’s Witnesses are distributing copies of two of their magazines​—the ‘Watch Tower’ and ‘Awake’ to encourage the living of a more moral life; and</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“WHEREAS, the copy of Watch Tower being distributed contains a timely and well-written article entitled ‘How Do You View Authority?’, now, therefore, be it</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“RESOLVED: That the Boston City Council in meeting assembled on this 5th day of June, 1972, commends the Jehovah’s Witnesses on their current program urging all persons of all faiths to lead a more moral life, and congratulates the volunteers of Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged in the current door-to-door program for their dedication, generosity and concern.</p>

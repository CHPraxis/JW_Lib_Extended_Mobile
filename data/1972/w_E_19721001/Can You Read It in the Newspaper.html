<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Newspapers report what is happening in the world. But they do not give the solution to world troubles. Nor do they tell about the one government that will solve them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You need the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines, for they give this information. They provide evidence that the time has arrived for God’s kingdom​—his government—​to bring a grand change in earth’s affairs. You can receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year. Send only $3.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me by mail for one year <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for which I enclose $3. For mailing the coupon I am to receive free six timely booklets.</p>

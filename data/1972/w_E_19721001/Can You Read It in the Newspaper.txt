Can You Read It in the Newspaper?
Newspapers report what is happening in the world. But they do not give the solution to world troubles. Nor do they tell about the one government that will solve them.
You need the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, for they give this information. They provide evidence that the time has arrived for God’s kingdom​—his government—​to bring a grand change in earth’s affairs. You can receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year. Send only $3.
Please send me by mail for one year The Watchtower and Awake! for which I enclose $3. For mailing the coupon I am to receive free six timely booklets.

Answer to a Prayer
◆ Participating in the house-to-house ministry, a minister in Chile called at a large, beautiful home and introduced herself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The lady of the house threw up her hands and with real fervor said, “Thank you, Jehovah.”
The Witness was taken by surprise at that. The lady grasped the minister’s hands and explained that for more than a year she had been praying for one of Jehovah’s witnesses to come to her home. “Only last night,” she said, “I earnestly begged Jehovah to send one of his people to visit me. When I saw you come to my gate just now, I prayed that you would be a witness of Jehovah.” It seems that this woman has a fleshly sister who sent her a copy of the Bible study aid The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, telling her to be sure to have the next Witness who called start a regular Bible study with her. Arrangements were immediately made for a study.
How refreshing it must be to God for individuals to express from their heart a desire to know the truth of his Word! When such ones petition him for help, he provides it.​—Matt. 7:7-11.

Make Disciples
Jesus commanded his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations.” Jehovah’s witnesses, now active in 207 lands, are obeying that command.
Read the yearly report of their discipling work in the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It includes special feature articles on selected countries. Send only 50c.
Please send me the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, for which I enclose 50c.

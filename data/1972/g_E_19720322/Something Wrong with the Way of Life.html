<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the United States alone nearly a million persons a year​—almost two a minute—​die of heart and blood vessel disease. This represents about 55 percent of all deaths. The situation is similar in Canada, Australia and most of Europe.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On the other hand, African Negroes and other peoples in less industrialized nations are notably free of heart disease. Also, this disease was practically unknown sixty or seventy years ago in places where it rages today. Obviously there is something wrong with a life-style that accounts for such a terrible epidemic that often strikes young men down in the prime of life.</p>

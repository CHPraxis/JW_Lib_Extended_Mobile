<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ The next time you drink a cool glass of water or relax in a tubful of warm water, you might think of the observation made in the article “Water Resources” by a professor of hydrology: “(1) Water is more abundant than any other substance on the surface of the earth, (2) it is almost the only inorganic liquid that can be found in nature which occurs as gas, liquid, and solid often at the same time, (3) water has a higher solvent power than any other fluid. And these are only a few of the very exceptional properties of water.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On the last night of his earthly life Jesus Christ said: “No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.” This is what he did when he died as a ransom sacrifice.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The commemorating of his death is the only observance that the Bible commands Christians to keep. After showing his disciples how to do it by means of a special evening meal, Jesus said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:24-46:11:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:24</a>) It is proper to do it on the anniversary of that night.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This year the anniversary of that special evening meal and of his death is after 6 p.m. on March 29. This corresponds with Nisan 14 on the sacred Hebrew calendar used in Jesus’ day.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you desire to be counted among Jesus’ friends and to receive the benefits of his ransom sacrifice, you will want to obey Jesus’ command to observe the memorial of his death. You are warmly invited to join with Jehovah’s witnesses at their Kingdom Halls as they celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal on March 29, after 6 p.m.</p>

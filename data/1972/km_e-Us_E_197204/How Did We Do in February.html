<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During February the 414,200 publishers made a total of 2,798,880 back-calls and conducted 305,617 home Bible studies. This represents effort, zeal and devotion not only in February but month after month.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">And in what has this steady, persistent work of teaching the truth to interested ones in these two vital features of the ministry resulted? The result is that 18,951 persons have been baptized during the first six months of the 1972 service year. This is a 10-percent increase in baptized ones over the same period last year. A real reason to rejoice and true incentive to keep on preaching and teaching!</p>

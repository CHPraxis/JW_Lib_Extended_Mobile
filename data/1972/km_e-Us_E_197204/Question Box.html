<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it appropriate for the audience to applaud each part of the ministry school or service meeting?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Audiences composed of Jehovah’s Witnesses are truly appreciative. It is a fine thing that they want to show that appreciation for the efforts of their brothers and the material they present from the platform. In some parts of the world in our day such appreciation may be indicated by applause. But applause should be spontaneous, from the heart. Also, it is usually an expression of appreciation for something out of the ordinary. And so, at large assemblies, including circuit assemblies, when special programs are arranged for and our brothers devote additional time and effort to their assignments, we find the audience applauding not only at the end of the talk but sometimes during it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But should this be true in our Kingdom Halls? Surely there can be no rule against it if it is done spontaneously and out of heartfelt appreciation. But normally we do not applaud these assignments because, for one thing, it can readily become perfunctory and so lose real meaning.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There is something all of us in our Kingdom Halls can do, however, to show genuine appreciation for the efforts of the one speaking and that is to stay alert during the talk, keeping our eyes on him and showing by the receptive expression on our faces that we are following his thoughts and are benefiting. Also, we often find it possible to talk to the speaker personally after the meeting, letting him know that we enjoyed his presentation.</p>

Branch Letter
Dear Fellow Publishers:
Returning from their trip around the world, Brothers Knorr and Larson gave the Bethel Family very interesting reports. In our last letter we shared with you some of their experiences on the first half of the trip​—as far as Kenya in East Africa.
From Kenya they went to Rhodesia, then on to South Africa, where they joined in the dedication of a new addition to the Branch. They then flew to Australia. There they learned how the Strathfield town council at first denied us a building permit, but when all the neighbors signed a petition of approval the council reconsidered and granted the permit. This addition to the Branch will house their first rotary magazine press.
After a short stop in Papua, it was on to the Philippines. An addition to the home, also to the factory to accommodate a rotary press, is being built there, mostly by the labor of our brothers.
When our travelers reached Japan they found the building of a new branch home and factory well under way. It is located at Numazu, some distance outside Tokyo. The trip to Japan was most timely, for while visiting the concern manufacturing three rotary presses for us, certain improvements in design were recommended in time for them to be included.
On the way home our two brothers stopped in Hawaii and spoke to a gathering of more than 4,800 in the famous Waikiki Shell. Finally, after traveling some 38,000 miles, touching down in 21 countries, visiting 16 Branches (12 of which were engaged in building new facilities), Brothers Knorr and Larson were back in Brooklyn Bethel, February 20​—in time to participate in the graduation exercises of the fifty-second class of Gilead, March 6.
Your brothers and fellow servants,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

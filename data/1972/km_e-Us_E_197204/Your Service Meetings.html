Might demonstrate points in paragraph 6 regarding following through on all back-calls and promises for subscriptions. Emphasize the importance of this. Can show two publishers discussing what they are determined to do. One tells of how she has gone through her witnessing case and searched out all house-to-house records, notes, expired-subscription slips and is in the process of arranging all of these calls in an orderly fashion and will schedule her affairs so as to contact each one of these persons so that they can have the subscriptions if there is interest. If people are not home, she will phone or make calls on different days and at different times of the day. She may even write some letters. The other publisher is impressed by the plan and is determined to do the same thing. They arrange to check with one another during the month and also make some arrangements to work together.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>27 min: </strong>The Benefits of Being Long-suffering. (“Aid,” pp. 1073, 1074) In introducing this part, stress the need for us to imitate Jehovah in his expression of long-suffering, a fruitage of his spirit. While it will not be necessary to read all the scriptures, be sure that the ones used are explained and applied in such a way as to make the main points stand out. The main goal is, not rapid coverage, but imparting understanding. (a) What is long-suffering? (“Aid,” p. 1073) (b) How have we personally benefited from Jehovah’s long-suffering, and how should this affect our attitude toward those who transgress against us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:22-45:9:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 9:22-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:14, 15</a>) (c) Why should Jehovah’s exercise of long-suffering deter us from violating his laws? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:1-47:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:1</a>) (d) When we are undergoing ridicule at work or at school, why can we, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:11-51:1:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 1:11</a> says, “be long-suffering with joy”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:12" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Heb. 6:10-12</a>) (e) What does Jesus’ example of long-suffering teach us about our responsibilities toward brothers who are very sensitive about such matters as food or drink? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:1-45:14:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 14:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:1-45:15:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15:1-3</a>; “Aid,” p. 1392, par. 2) (f) Why would our failure to manifest long-suffering toward those who are spiritually weak be injurious to them as well as to ourselves? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:42-41:9:42" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 9:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:30-46:10:33" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:30-33</a>) (g) From what will long-suffering protect us when one of our brothers or sisters speaks somewhat harshly to us? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:28-20:25:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 25:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Eccl. 7:9</a>) (h) What will enable a sister to be long-suffering with an unbelieving husband? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:1-6</a>; “Aid,” p. 1073, par. 6) (i) How can Jesus’ example help a husband to be long-suffering toward his wife? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 5:25-29</a>) (j) When children do not respond to the truth, what hope can assist parents to be long-suffering?

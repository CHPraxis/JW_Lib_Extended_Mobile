Why Do We Grow Old?
Science does not really have the answer to this question, but you can know the answer. You can also know why you can anticipate an end to the whole aging process.
You will find the details in the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. One of its twenty-two chapters is “Why We Grow Old and Die.” This hard-covered book of 192 pages will be sent to you postpaid for only 25c.
Please send me The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for which I enclose 25c.

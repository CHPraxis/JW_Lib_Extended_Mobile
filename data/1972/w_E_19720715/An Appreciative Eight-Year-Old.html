<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Recently a handwritten letter was received at the offices of the Watch Tower Society, the publishers of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. It was from an eight-year-old girl whose parents are Jehovah’s witnesses. Her letter reflected a keen appreciation on her part of the work the Society’s headquarters staff (Bethel Family) do in preparing the publications. She wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Dear Brothers, I am 8 years old, and in the 2nd grade at school. Not too long ago the State Forest Department had an essay contest. The subject we were to write on was ‘Why Plant a Tree?’ I entered it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When I got home from school I told my mother about it. My mother said I should go to the ‘Watch Tower Index.’ So I did. I found lots of information on trees. The article I liked best was one found in the April 8, 1956, ‘Awake!’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“This week I was notified that I won first place in the contest out of over 600 entries. They had my picture taken for the newspaper, and gave me a prize of $15.00. Since I know I would not have won if it had not been for the ‘Awake!’ I would like to give $10.00 of this money to you for use of something the Bethel Family might need. Sincerely.”</p>

Earth a Paradise!
Is it possible? The Bible shows that mankind once lived in paradise, in the garden of Eden.
Why was it lost? How can it be regained? What does your attitude toward God and his true worship have to do with whether you will be favored with life in the restored Paradise?
These questions are answered in the fascinating 416-page book Paradise Restored to Mankind​—by Theocracy!
It contains a careful analysis of the restoration prophecies in the Bible books of Haggai and Zechariah, as possible from the twentieth-century vantage point.
This hardbound book will be sent to you, postpaid, for only 50c.

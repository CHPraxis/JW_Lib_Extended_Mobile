Divine Rulership​—The Only Hope of All Mankind
HOW has the mounting world trouble affected you, our reader? Has it caused you to lose all hope for a brighter tomorrow? It has not affected us in that way. You may wonder why not. Well, it is because we have a hope that is solidly based. In fact, the growing world trouble makes us all the more confident that we have an unfailing hope, the best hope. Our desire is to share it with you. This explains why we are publishing this booklet. It presents in print the public address that features the chain of Divine Rulership Assemblies that is encircling all the earth. May your reading it bolster, if not even rekindle, hope within your heart.

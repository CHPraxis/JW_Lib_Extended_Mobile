<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you wish that you could still obtain bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 1971? You can. The Society has on hand more than 10,000 volumes of each.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Are there persons who are newly associated with your congregation who would like to have their own bound volumes? What about those with whom you are conducting home Bible studies? Do not hesitate to order as many as you can use, doing so through the congregation. We will be glad to supply them at the reduced price of $1.50 per volume until all of them are gone.</p>

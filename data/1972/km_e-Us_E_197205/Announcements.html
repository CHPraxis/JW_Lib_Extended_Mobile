<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">◆ Regular and vacation pioneers desiring to spend a week or more during the summer working congregation territory that has not been covered for a year or longer may write to the Society by May 15. Please estimate how many territories (each containing perhaps 200 to 300 homes) you can work. Have in mind that such territory is usually rural and so an automobile is needed. Let us know the greatest distance you would be able to travel.</p>

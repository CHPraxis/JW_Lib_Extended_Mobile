Question Box
● What kind of publications should be found in the Kingdom Hall library?
The Kingdom Hall library is a Bible study library. Bibles, current publications of the Society (including “Indexes” and “Kingdom Ministry”) and a good dictionary are essential. If you have them, “Watchtower” and “Awake!” bound volumes from past years and older publications of the Society will be helpful. When available, encyclopedias, atlases, or books on grammar and history may be useful, but we do not recommend purchasing them.
It is not necessary to include books on health, genetics, politics, science, mathematics, etc., which one might have in a personal library. It is inadvisable to have books on spiritism, mysticism, higher criticism, evolution or fiction in the library.
The school servant is responsible for the library and for putting in new publications and bound volumes of the Society as soon as they are available. He would do well to mark on the inside cover of each book that it is the property of the congregation.
Everyone should cooperate in keeping the books clean and in good condition. Small children should not be allowed to play with library books, for they may damage them. At least once a year the school servant should have someone check over the books to see if any need repair or replacement.

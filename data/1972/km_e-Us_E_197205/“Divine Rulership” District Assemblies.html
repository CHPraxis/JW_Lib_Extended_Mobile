<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you selected the assembly you will attend this summer? The complete listing appears in the May 15 <em>Watchtower. </em>Most of us usually attend the nearest assembly; however, because the size of facilities at some cities is limited, we are listing below some cities paired with circuits and we recommend that brothers in the mentioned circuits try to attend those assemblies so there may be adequate seating for brothers attending all assemblies.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Please note that assemblies in Toledo and Port Huron each will be held two weeks in succession and the circuits to attend each week are shown for the week preferred. For Oakland, Pleasanton, Santa Rosa, Inglewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Tacoma and Puyallup we have indicated the circuits that should attend each, since the assembly locations for some of these are so close together geographically. As an example, the facilities in Toledo, Ohio, are not as large as those in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and although the Cleveland circuits are slightly closer to Toledo, it would be best for them to attend Pittsburgh, where there will be plenty of room.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><em>ROOMING: </em>Room Request forms will soon be mailed to your congregation. Please fill out the form very carefully and mail it directly to the assembly city (NOT to the Society) no earlier than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly selected. If you receive an assignment in a motel or private home and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please send word to the address on your assignment card and also to <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>the convention rooming department that you will not be using the accommodation assigned to you. In this way the rooming department will be able to assign the room to someone else.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><em>VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </em>There is much work to be done at each assembly to care for the needs of our brothers, yet many hands make the work light and joyful. Why not plan to volunteer as individuals and family groups. Fill out volunteer service applications, giving the completed forms to your congregation servant for him to sign and forward to the convention city. (Do NOT send them to the Society.) If you later find that you are unable to serve in your assignment, please advise the volunteer service department of your change in plans.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><em>PIONEERS: </em>Be sure to bring your cafeteria ticket to the assembly. Treat it like cash. Replacements will not be available.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Be sure to attend all four days of the “Divine Rulership” District Assembly.</p>

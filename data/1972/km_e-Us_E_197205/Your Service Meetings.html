<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201972161/">Make Known the Name of Jehovah</a>.” Question-and-answer discussion. Explain how publishers can interest people in reading the “Know Jehovah” book by highlighting points from a chapter such as 1, 2, 9, 19 or 21 on a back-call.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Demonstrate how a presentation such as the following may be used to show others how to study the book: “I appreciated our conversation last week because it revealed some of the changes that the Creator, Jehovah God, will bring to pass for the good of mankind in the near future. What is unusual is that most people do not even know the name of the one who will make these beneficial changes. Yet his name is the original and greatest name in the universe. The ‘Know Jehovah’ book you received last week comments on the seriousness of knowing Jehovah. Let’s read the first paragraph of chapter one to see how we can benefit from the actions of nations in Bible times. [Read paragraph one.] What has been the attitude of nations and peoples toward that name? Do you think it would benefit us to know more about that name?” Allow householder time to answer. Continue the discussion and explain how the questions at the bottom of the page are used to isolate the main points in the paragraph. Proceed on to the next paragraph as time and circumstances permit.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Chairman then explains that after consideration of one or possibly two chapters, publisher will point out that the remainder of the “Know Jehovah” book presents a much more detailed discussion that the person will enjoy reading. At this point, invite him to attend the congregation book study with you. Then explain that knowing Jehovah is more than an acknowledgment of what he is going to do. It is a matter of knowing all the aspects of true worship and conforming to these. To make sure he believes as the Bible teaches, invite him to have a six-month course of Bible study in the “Truth” book.</p>

(“Aid,” p. 676, par. 9) (b) Why should we be concerned about having the quality of goodness?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Presenting the “New World Translation” and “Great Teacher” book. (See Nov. 1971 “Kingdom Ministry” for suggestions on offering Bible.) First time offering “Great Teacher” book; people have not seen it in door-to-door work. Most householders have young children or grandchildren, interested in their needs. Presentation may be based on points found on page 5 of book; it can help to prevent ‘generation gap’ so common now, can aid to keep communication open. Publishers can be alert to note local news on juvenile questions; try to select chapter that fits situation and speak about subject. Could use Chapter 17 or 23. Show how “Great Teacher” book and Bible go together. Can point out that parents have given a Bible and book to child as reward for having done something well; added incentive to continue to do right. Could use as reward for having done well at school. Some have Bible now. “Great Teacher” book itself makes wonderful gift for children; can offer four for a dollar so each child in home can have own copy. (Demonstrate a presentation of offer featuring points from “Great Teacher” book.)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Get expressions from congregation on actual experiences in placing Bible or “Great Teacher” book, what appeals to local people. May wish to try offering “Great Teacher” book in street work; many family people live in hotels or buildings we cannot enter. Best way is to approach them with book in hand. “Great Teacher” book also excellent for people of limited education. Urge all to get good supply of “Great Teacher” book.</p>

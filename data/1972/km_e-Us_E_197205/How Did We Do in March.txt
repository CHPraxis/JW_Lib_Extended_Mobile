How Did We Do in March?
That Jehovah is gathering ones of honest heart and they are being motivated to join in offering the fruit of their lips to His praise is nicely reflected in our report for March. (Heb. 13:15) There was a total of 424,311 publishers and pioneers in the field preaching the good news of the Kingdom, a fine new peak in proclaimers! Yes, there were 5,909 more of us in field service during March than any other month to date, and 14,898 more than for March 1971. Excellent! What will be the results for April? All of us will be anxious to know on receiving next month’s “Kingdom Ministry.”

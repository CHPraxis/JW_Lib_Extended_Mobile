<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Would you like to associate with such people? Would you like to be with people who really enjoy living and who take pleasure in doing things for others?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Such people can be found at the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses. They build relationships on a foundation of truth and neighbor love. Do your friends do that?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The fine principles that guide them are in the Bible, and these are discussed in the <strong>Watchtower </strong>magazine. This Biblical magazine is the basis of one of the weekly meetings in all Kingdom Halls.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Have “The Watchtower” come into your home so you can benefit from the truth that it presents. It will give you the very best type of association and will come to you for one year, twice a month, for only $1.50.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send me <em>The Watchtower </em>for one year for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the gift booklets: <em>World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace, God’s Way Is Love </em>and <em>The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years.</em></p>

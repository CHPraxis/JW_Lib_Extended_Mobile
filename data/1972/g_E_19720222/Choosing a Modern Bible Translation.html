<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Which translation best represents what the inspired Bible writers recorded in Hebrew and Greek? Which also is written in a way that is most easily understood?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before you answer, we urge you to obtain and read the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>Not only is it accurate in the way it expresses in English what is in the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts of the Bible, but it also is written in a manner that is easy to read.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <strong>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </strong>contains the entire sixty-six books of the Bible and can be had for only $1. If you want the deluxe edition, send $3. On the other hand, if your eyes require the much larger, big-print edition, send $5.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There is benefit in comparing Bible translations, as when you want to see various ways in which a scripture has been translated. So it would be good to have in your personal library the <strong>Authorized Version </strong>($1) and the <strong>American Standard Version, </strong>available in pocket size ($1.50).</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For careful students of the Bible we recommend also <strong>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </strong>($2) and <strong>The Emphatic Diaglott </strong>($2). Both make available to you the Greek text of the Christian Greek Scriptures with a word-for-word translation under the Greek. The first has the master Greek text prepared by the scholars Westcott and Hort, and the second has the Greek text prepared by J. J. Griesbach.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Round out your personal library with this fine variety of Bible translations.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Please send me the following Bibles that I have checked and for which I enclose $ ․․․․․․: <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>($1) □; <em>New World Translation, </em>deluxe edition ($3) □; <em>New World Translation, </em>large-print edition ($5) □; <em>Authorized Version </em>($1) □; <em>American Standard Version, </em>pocket size ($1.50) □; <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </em>($2) □; <em>Emphatic Diaglott </em>($2) □.</p>

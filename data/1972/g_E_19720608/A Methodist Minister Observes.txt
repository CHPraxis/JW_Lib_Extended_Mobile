A Methodist Minister Observes
AMONG the crowd of 1,649 attending an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Taylor, Texas, during January 1971, was a minister from the local Methodist church. In addition to hearing the public Bible lecture, the clergyman had an opportunity to observe the conduct and conversation of the Witnesses from the eighteen congregations in attendance. In his church newsletter the following week the Methodist minister made these observations about the Witness assembly:
“Much prayer and many conversations dealt with subjects in the word of God; with things which never grow old! The Name Jehovah was held in deep respect and honor. Odd people, these witnesses of Jehovah! They stand for something. They have very definite disciplines. They study the Word of God with system and regularity. They keep their kids busy with things that matter. There is a lightness and joy about them which is most attractive and wholesome. There is a seriousness about them which commands attention and respect. They know what they believe! They know in Whom they have believed! And when they have a gathering they have trouble finding a place large enough to meet in. Other religious meetings dealing with eternally irrelevant things have problems finding places small enough to meet in! Do you suppose we sophisticated religionists could learn some valuable lessons from these people? Or is it that we think we have already achieved that which we are capable of achieving?”

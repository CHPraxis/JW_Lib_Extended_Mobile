To Drink or Not
● In many places drinking alcoholic beverages is legal; but a sensible person will avoid acting as if it were compulsory. Calling attention to what is truly important, the Scriptures say: “The kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit.”​—Rom. 14:17.

A Peaceful and Unpolluted Earth Will Soon Be a Reality
The basis for this happy hope is explained in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, which Jehovah’s witnesses offer to people in all parts of the earth.
Benefit from these fine, upbuilding magazines by having them come regularly to your home. “The Watchtower,” with its enlightening Scriptural articles, and “Awake!,” with its great variety of articles on practical subjects, can give you hope for the future and widen your personal knowledge. The two magazines, four copies per month, only $3.00 per year.
Please send me the Watchtower and Awake! magazines for one year for which I enclose a total of $3. Send also the gift booklets When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God, World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace, God’s Way Is Love, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years and Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.

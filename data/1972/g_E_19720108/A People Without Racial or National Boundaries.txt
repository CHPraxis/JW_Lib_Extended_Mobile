A People Without Racial or National Boundaries
Although scattered over 207 countries, Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy a unity that is unique in a world that is divided racially and nationally.
Read about their worldwide growth and activities in the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Of special interest are feature stories on their work in Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Taiwan and Zambia. There is also a Scripture text with comments for each day of the year, to help you to get every day off to a good start. Send only 50 cents.
Please send me the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, for which I enclose 50c.

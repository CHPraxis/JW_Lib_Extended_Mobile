<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Newspaper reports of earthquakes often indicate their force in terms of numbers on the Richter Scale. But what do these ratings indicate in the effects caused?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Running through the numbers 1 to 8 on the Richter Scale, the effects are these: 1 - quake detectable only by seismographic measurement; 2 - hanging objects swing slightly and a few people might feel the tremor; 3 - people indoors feel some vibrations; 4 - buildings tremble and glassware breaks; 5 - furniture overturns and pictures fall from walls; 6 masonry cracks, some houses cave in, windows break and chimneys fall; 7 extensive damage to dams, dikes and bridges, with many buildings collapsing; 8 - all structures receive catastrophic damage.</p>

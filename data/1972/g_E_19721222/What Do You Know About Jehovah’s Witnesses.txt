What Do You Know About Jehovah’s Witnesses?
What happened to them in Japan during the second world War? How do the Japanese respond to the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses now?
Why have so many West Africans become Jehovah’s witnesses? How did the preaching work begin in Ghana?
These and many other questions are answered in the 1973 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. You will be fascinated by the feature stories about the beginning and development of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil, the British Isles, Ghana, Guatemala and Japan.
For your spiritual encouragement the Yearbook also contains a Scripture text for each day of the year along with a brief comment. Order your copy today. Send only 50 cents.

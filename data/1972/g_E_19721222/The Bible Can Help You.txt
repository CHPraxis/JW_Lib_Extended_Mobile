The Bible Can Help You
It can remedy economic problems. It can safeguard physical and mental health. It can improve homelife.
Whoever you are​—businessman, farmer, husband, wife or child—​you can receive beneficial instruction from the pages of the Bible.
The book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” shows how the Bible can help you. It contains a brief synopsis of the contents of each of the sixty-six books of the Bible, explaining why they are beneficial for our day. This valuable hardbound book of 352 pages, the same page size as this magazine, is yours for only $1.
Please send me “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” for which I enclose $1. For mailing this coupon I am also to receive the booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

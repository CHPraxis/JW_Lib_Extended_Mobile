<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Should it be rulers of the Communist East? Or is Western Democracy a better form of government for mankind?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Really, no form of human rule has proved satisfactory. None have removed entirely poverty and human suffering. What mankind needs is rule by God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But is there any reason to believe that God will take over the direct ruling of mankind? Learn what the Bible says about this. Read <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>and <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” </em>These fascinating hardbound books, of 704 and 384 pages respectively, discuss, verse by verse, the entire Bible book of Revelation. They are yours for only $1.25.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send me <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>and <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” </em>for which I enclose $1.25.

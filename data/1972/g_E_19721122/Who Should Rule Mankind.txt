Who Should Rule Mankind?
Should it be rulers of the Communist East? Or is Western Democracy a better form of government for mankind?
Really, no form of human rule has proved satisfactory. None have removed entirely poverty and human suffering. What mankind needs is rule by God.
But is there any reason to believe that God will take over the direct ruling of mankind? Learn what the Bible says about this. Read “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! and “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” These fascinating hardbound books, of 704 and 384 pages respectively, discuss, verse by verse, the entire Bible book of Revelation. They are yours for only $1.25.
Please send me “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! and “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” for which I enclose $1.25. Send also, the gift booklets “This Good News of the Kingdom” and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

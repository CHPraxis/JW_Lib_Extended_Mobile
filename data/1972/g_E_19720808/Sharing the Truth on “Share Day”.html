<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ The students in the third grade at one public school in Washington, D.C., were invited to participate in “Share Day.” On this day selected students were to bring to class something from their home and share it with their classmates. When his turn came up, nine-year-old Jimmy, whose mother is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, wondered what to bring, what to “share” with his classmates.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With the permission of his teacher he brought to school a copy of <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, </em>a book his mother had used in instructing him about the Bible. His schoolteacher was delighted and ‘shared’ with the entire class the chapter “How Man Lived Through a Flood over All the Earth.” This proved to be so informative and enjoyable for the teacher and the other students that she continued to read into the next chapter, “God Promises His Friend to Bless All Human Families.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When one knows of good and lifesaving news, is it not the logical thing to share this with others?</p>

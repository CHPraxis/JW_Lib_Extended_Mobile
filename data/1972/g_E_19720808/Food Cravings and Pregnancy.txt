Food Cravings and Pregnancy
◆ Two British scientists, after making a study of one hundred women, found that fifty-one of them had a craving for unusual food during pregnancy. Some craved sour pickles and apples. Sixty-two of the women said they strongly disliked certain foods and drinks that they usually enjoyed. Included were tea and coffee. As to the significance of the unusual cravings, the scientists reported that it does not mean something is missing from the women’s diets. Rather, it is simply because pregnancy temporarily changes the tastes of many women.

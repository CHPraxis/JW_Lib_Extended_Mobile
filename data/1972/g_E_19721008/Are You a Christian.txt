Are You a Christian?
Many people who profess to be Christian are Christian in name only. They do not follow Jesus’ example, living by the principles he taught.
The Watchtower is a magazine that is designed to help people to become Christians in fact. It has helped many thousands of people to transform their lives.
You can benefit from having The Watchtower come to your home regularly. It will arrive twice a month for one year for only $1.50.
Please send me The Watchtower for one year for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the three gift booklets Divine Rulership​—the Only Hope of All Mankind, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” and When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God.

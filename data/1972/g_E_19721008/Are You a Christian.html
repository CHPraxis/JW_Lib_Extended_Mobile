<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many people who profess to be Christian are Christian in name only. They do not follow Jesus’ example, living by the principles he taught.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>The Watchtower </em>is a magazine that is designed to help people to become Christians in fact. It has helped many thousands of people to transform their lives.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You can benefit from having <em>The Watchtower </em>come to your home regularly. It will arrive twice a month for one year for only $1.50.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send me <em>The Watchtower </em>for one year for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the three gift booklets <em>Divine Rulership​—the Only Hope of All Mankind, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” </em>and <em>When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God.</em></p>

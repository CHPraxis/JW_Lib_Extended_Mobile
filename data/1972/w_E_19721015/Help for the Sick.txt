Help for the Sick
Are you troubled with poor health? Would you like to have helpful suggestions for living in a way that contributes to good health now? Would you like to have a sound basis for believing that complete relief from all sickness will come, and that it will come soon?
If you would, you will want to read Awake! magazine on a regular basis. It has informative articles designed to fill this need. You can receive two issues a month for one year for only $1.50.
Please send me Awake! magazine for one year, for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the three gift booklets When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God, The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

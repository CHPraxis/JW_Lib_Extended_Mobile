How Did We Do in November?
At the outset of the month all of us were determined to be certain that the people in the territory we cover would “know Jehovah” or at least hear his name during November. After spending 5,928,295 hours in talking to others about Jehovah, it appears that a big stride was taken toward accomplishing that purpose.
In addition to our talking and stirring up interest in Jehovah, a total of 713,596 books were placed. These are now in the homes of the people. Every time they glance in the book or even read the title, they will be thinking about Jehovah. At least they will be reminded of his Holy Name. We hope they will read and study God’s Word so as to know and appreciate Jehovah more fully, and we can take pleasure in our part in causing them to become acquainted with the Divine Name.

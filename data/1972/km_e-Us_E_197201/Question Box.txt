Question Box
● Why is it important for one who is called upon to offer prayer in behalf of the congregation to use sufficient volume to be heard by all present?
Representing others before Jehovah’s throne of undeserved kindness is a great privilege. Of course, God can hear us even when we pray silently to him. But when we represent others in prayer, it is only proper for all present to be able to hear clearly what is said. If they cannot hear, how can they say “Amen” to the prayer?​—1 Cor. 14:16, 17.
Usually a brother offering prayer can be understood if he stands up, expresses himself with sufficient volume and speaks distinctly. Upon standing for the prayer he may find it advantageous to face the main body of the audience and not lower his head extremely, thus his voice will carry toward them.​—Compare Matthew 14:19.
If conditions in the hall, such as the size of the crowd or noises coming from outside, cause such an interference that the brother praying cannot easily be heard without amplification of his voice, then, if there is sound equipment in the hall, those praying may use a microphone so that all may hear and express agreement. Situations vary in each congregation, so whether to use a microphone or not should be decided locally.
If the brother is informed beforehand that he will be called upon to pray, it will aid in making his prayer fluent, coherent, earnest, rich in thought content and apropos to the particular meeting.

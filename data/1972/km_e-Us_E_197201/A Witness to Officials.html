<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The January 8, 1972, issue of <em>Awake! </em>is one that can beneficially be used to give a fine witness to government officials. It features a series of articles on the prominent current question “Are Prisons the Answer?” We encourage you to make good use of it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Congregations could beneficially make up a list of all federal, state and local judges, policemen and other government officials who actually live in their territory. Then send to each one of them this issue of <em>Awake!, </em>with a brief covering letter and a copy of the new folder “What Do You Really Know About God?” Or, if you prefer, visit them and offer them the magazine in the regular manner. These men, too, need to be given the opportunity to learn the superiority of Jehovah’s ways, and this magazine provides a good subject with which to reach them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do you need more copies of the magazine in order to care for this distribution? If so, please order them right away.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Reporting baptisms: Baptisms performed locally by a congregation should be reported on the bottom of the Congregation Report card for that month. This does not include circuit assembly baptisms, since they are reported through the assembly arrangement.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">◆ On Sunday, March 26, a special public talk entitled “Mankind’s Deliverance into God’s New Order” will be delivered world wide. Manuscripts will be sent to all congregations in due time. This special talk will be followed by two more. It is recommended that all congregations schedule for April 23 the talk “Jehovah Has Become King​—How We Know It,” and for May 21 the talk “What Jehovah’s Kingship Means for You.” Full outlines for these two talks will also be sent to each congregation. If the circuit servant is visiting your congregation during any of these three weeks, or if you are having your circuit assembly, then we suggest that you arrange to have the talk in this special series one week later than is shown above. Handbills for these talks may be ordered now.</p>

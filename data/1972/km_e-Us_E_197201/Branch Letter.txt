Branch Letter
Dear Fellow Publishers:
During the recent New York dock strike more than a million pounds of our literature piled up here, waiting to be shipped. But in the first two weeks after a temporary halt in that strike things moved fast. We shipped 834,300 pounds of that backlog. Besides, over 4,000,000 magazines finally got on their way overseas. Fortunately, this letup came just in time to ship out the new Yearbook.
Have you been reading this new Yearbook? The Bethel family reads a few pages each day at the breakfast table, and we hear that many of you do the same thing.
Have you read the exciting report about how the preaching work got started in Argentina? From one zealous publisher back in 1924 the work spread out along the railroad lines, by bicycle and on foot to encompass the more than one million square miles making up that country. The report from Czechoslovakia is also amazing. Even before the second world war the influence of the Witnesses there in some places was so strong that the local clergyman simply moved out.
You will also learn how the Supreme Court of Nicaragua thwarted efforts of the Catholic Church to stop the Witnesses. And, instead of sad war news from Pakistan, you will thrill to hear how the “good news” has spread there in the past forty-five years. Learn, too, how Jehovah has richly blessed your brothers in Zambia, even though house-to-house work has been prohibited and thousands of their children have been expelled from the public schools. The history of the work in Afghanistan, Dominican Republic and Taiwan is also included in this report.
Did you obtain extra copies of the Yearbook for those with whom you are conducting studies? You can still get more if you order them soon. Reading these reports could well be the thing that will move these persons to share the good news with others.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

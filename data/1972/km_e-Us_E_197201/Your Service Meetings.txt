 5 min: Introduction, text and comments.
15 min: “Using Subscriptions to Announce that ‘Jehovah Himself Has Become King.’” Audience discussion. Handle material in insert from beginning to subtitle “Our Own Attitude Most Important.” Also, have comments from brothers who have personally heard newly interested persons express their appreciation for the magazines or who have observed how they have been benefited. Also cover article “A Witness to Officials.”
20 min: “Serving with a Complete Heart.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate the points discussed in paragraph 3, using the January 15 “Watchtower.” The demonstration may be conducted in the way of a practice session with another member of the family serving as a householder.

10 min: “How Should You View Discipline?” (November 1, 1971, “Watchtower”) Could be a discussion between two teen-agers, one of whom has been disciplined by his parents and appreciates it, so is able to encourage fellow teen-ager who has taken a somewhat indifferent viewpoint toward correction. Actually read and discuss one or two scriptures. (Adjust to local circumstances.)
20 min: “Using Subscriptions to Announce that ‘Jehovah Himself Has Become King.’” Handle from subtitle “Our Own Attitude Most Important” to “Where to Get Subscriptions.” While basically this can be handled best by audience participation, it would also be appropriate, if desired, to include a discussion between two or more publishers regarding the benefits they personally have derived from “The Watchtower” and how this should affect their view toward offering subscriptions to other people.

20 min: “Using Subscriptions to Announce that ‘Jehovah Himself Has Become King.’” Handle from “Where to Get Subscriptions” to end of insert. Use audience participation, but have one or two brief demonstrations showing what could be said in door-to-door work to show the value of the magazines, or informal witnessing to a fellow employee or a brother of school age approaching his teacher. Highlight a specific article that would appeal to the individuals approached.
15 min: Concluding comments. Also any appropriate Announcements. Discuss with audience information in article “When a Christian Is in Business,” from December 15 “Watchtower.” Song 81.

30 min: Why Love Works for Good. (“Aid,” pp. 1082, 1083; w64 pp. 495-501) In introduction, point out that, to be true Christians, we must do more than preach and attend meetings; we must manifest the fruits of God’s spirit in our everyday affairs. Read together 1 Corinthians 13:4-8; then draw out comments from the audience on the following points, and show how these illuminate 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Encourage audience to use the Bible and to reason on the key points in the texts. It is not necessary to read all the scriptures, but do not rush through the material. Cover as much as you can handle effectively. (a) What does it mean to be long-suffering? When and how are we called on to be long-suffering toward worldly people and even our own brothers? (Matt. 5:44, 45; Jas. 5:9, 10) (b) What opportunities are there in our own homes to show love by being kind? (Eph. 4:32; Prov. 31:10, 26) (c) How will love aid us to act properly when others acquire possessions or privileges that we do not have? (Phil. 2:2-4; 1 Tim. 6:6-8) (d) Why does one who displays godlike love not brag or become puffed up about himself and his accomplishments? (Ps. 75:5-7; Jas. 4:13-16) (e) In what ways are loose conduct and fornication evidence of lack of agape love on the part of those who indulge in such things? (Rom. 13:8-10, 13) (f) If others wrong us, against what will love protect us? (1 Pet. 3:8, 9; 4:8) (g) To have true love, what must we hate or speak out against and why? (Ps. 97:10; Rom. 12:9; Gal. 2:11-14) (h) What is included in the “all things” that love believes and for which it hopes? (John 6:60-68; 1 John 4:1; Rom. 5:5) (i) What benefits come to us when love moves us to ‘endure all things’? (Prov. 3:11, 12; Heb. 10:36) (j) Why does love never fail? (“Aid,” p. 1083, par. 4)
15 min: Concluding comments. Handle the “Question Box” in conclusion, emphasizing the importance of prayer in the lives of each one of us. Song 45.

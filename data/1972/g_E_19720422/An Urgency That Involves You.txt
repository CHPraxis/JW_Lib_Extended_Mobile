An Urgency That Involves You
DOES the prospect of a new administration of earth’s affairs appeal to you? Do you find it comforting to envision an earth without war, false religion, immorality, sickness and death? Or does it all seem like a dream?
Actually, the message about God’s purpose of a righteous new order is no dream. Jehovah God does not lie or deceive. (Heb. 6:18) He does not promise something he will not bring to reality. And when he causes his servants to distribute world wide a warning now, with special concentration on the so-called “Christian” nations, we can be sure he means it.
We can also be sure that when God says he will annihilate world religion and preserve his true religion, he means that too. The question is not whether that will happen. It will, without fail. The question is, What will you do about it?
First of all, when you see that world religion is guilty of misrepresenting God and of misleading the people, what should you do? You should do what God’s Word says to do. What is that? Get away from it before its sudden crash comes! When Jesus called the professional religionists of his day “blind guides,” he said to the common people: “Let them be.”​—Matt. 15:14.
Yes, leave them alone! Get away from them! World religion is unclean and bloodguilty in God’s sight. So the strong admonition of the apostle must be heeded by those who want to keep living:
“What fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness? . . . And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols? . . . ‘“Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,” says Jehovah, “and quit touching the unclean thing”’; ‘“and I will take you in.”’ ‘“And I shall be a father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me,” says Jehovah the Almighty.’”​—2 Cor. 6:14-18.
If your church is a part of world religion, flee now! If you know a clergyman who you feel is a good man, then he should flee too!
These are strong words, but they are true. They are God’s mind on the matter. For a certainty, time is running out for world religion. Its end is not far off. Therefore you need to take urgent action now.

Mere flight from world religion, while a necessary first step, is not enough however. Even atheists have done that much. There is also another vital step. Everyone who wants life in God’s new order must come to know God to receive protection through this system’s end.​—John 17:3.
How can you really get to know God and what he requires of you? Only by your personally studying his Word, the Bible. To do this you need assistance.
What was the basic method the early disciples used to guide people to the truth about God? They taught persons privately, often going into the homes of interested persons. There, in the privacy of their own homes, people learned what the Bible really said. It is the same today. Jehovah’s witnesses carry on a free six-month program of home visits for those who really want to know about God. By this means millions of persons have received Bible instruction.​—Acts 20:20.
True, sometimes these persons meet opposition. It may come from uninformed persons, friends or relatives. But often, by being tactful and patient, they are able to help those who are well-meaning to learn the way to life in God’s new order.
Have you availed yourself of the free Bible education offered by Jehovah’s witnesses? If not, we urge you to do so now. Do not be among those who are like the sons-in-law of Lot. When the God-dishonoring city of Sodom was about to be destroyed by an act of God, Lot warned them. But the Bible says, “In the eyes of his sons-in-law he [Lot] seemed like a man who was joking.” (Gen. 19:14) But it was no joke. The next morning Sodom was annihilated. So were Lot’s sons-in-law.
Do you love life? Do you want to keep living? Then hasten to do what God’s Word says: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, . . . Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”​—Zeph. 2:3.

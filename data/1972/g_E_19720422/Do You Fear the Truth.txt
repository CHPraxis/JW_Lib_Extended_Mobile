Do You Fear the Truth?
You shouldn’t. Of course, as an old saying goes, at times “the truth hurts.” But then, so does an operation that can save your life.
If a hurricane was headed your way, would you want the weather bureau to tell you the truth about it? No doubt you would, for then you could act to preserve life and property.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How many real friends do you have? For many people they can be counted on one hand. Would you like to see the time when everyone on earth is your friend and is sincerely interested in your welfare? The time is near when all mankind will live in warm, peaceful friendship.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Learn how such friendship is assured by the Bible. Read the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. </em>This hard-covered book of 192 pages is ideal for Bible study. The book is only 25c. Also request a free home Bible study.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Check either or both: Please send me <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for which I enclose 25c □. Also, I would like to have one of Jehovah’s witnesses call at my home to discuss the Bible with me free of charge □.</p>

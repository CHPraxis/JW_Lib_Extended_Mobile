<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Much emphasis has been placed on the need for maintaining spirituality in the congregation. For various reasons, you may feel that you are very limited in what you can contribute toward this effort. You may have concluded that concern for such matters rests with the overseers. Could it be that you are overlooking a fine opportunity to help, one that is available to you and members of your family right in your home? The congregation is composed primarily of families; strong spirituality in the family, therefore, contributes immeasurably toward maintaining this quality in the congregation. Your family, regardless of circumstances, can directly help toward achieving this objective. How?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>A discerning and well balanced family appreciates the provisions made by its head, whether they are material things, recreation or Bible instruction. When the family has cultivated such an appreciation, then every provision made by the Head of the congregation, Christ Jesus, will also be gratefully received by taking full advantage of every meeting, assignment or privilege of service in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If good habits of personal and family study are maintained in the household, the family will also have strong appreciation for congregation meetings. The family’s keen interest and participation in these meetings will be an encouragement to others, inciting them “to love and fine works.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In a home where the headship of the dedicated Christian father is respected and his guidance in family affairs is acknowledged, there is unity of thought and action to get things done. Such a family will be respectful and cooperative with the older men in the congregation, giving them much joy in fulfilling their responsibilities as shepherds.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The family is blessed when the spirit of love predominates in the household and each one shows a ready willingness to overlook the shortcomings of others. Peace and unity result, and this in turn exerts a strong influence toward helping family members to display this same spirit toward others in the congregation. When these qualities flourish among the brothers, a warm and happy relationship prevails for the upbuilding of everyone.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah instructs us to govern our lives by the principles set forth in his Word. When the family makes sincere effort to do so, it will resist worldly thinking and the fads of dress, attitude and conduct that such things encourage. A congregation composed of many such families will have few problems requiring counsel or discipline by the overseers.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Family members that have made a practice of being kind, thoughtful and sincerely concerned about one another will be inclined to manifest these same fine qualities toward everyone in the congregation. This assures that a warm, loving interest will be shown toward those needing encouragement and whatever assistance such ones need will very likely be available.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The family that really appreciates what Jehovah has promised and senses the urgency of the times will be motivated to share its faith with others. In a congregation made up of such families, there will rarely be a lack of support for field service activity or a need to give constant reminders about the importance of regular participation.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Finally, and perhaps most important, the family that is spiritually strong and fully devoted to Jehovah will be able to acquire the endurance needed to resist successfully any adversity that threatens its well-being. A group of such families united in a congregation will likewise be firm, able to endure loyally all the trials that the final days of this system are sure to bring.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In view of the foregoing, it becomes apparent that all of us (fathers, mothers and children) can help in building a spiritually strong congregation. While the overseers can assist by giving encouragement and direction, real progress depends upon what we do individually and as a family. One of the most successful efforts to build spirituality in the congregation begins in the home. When each family member personally cultivates the wholesome elements of spirituality, the whole congregation will ultimately reflect these same qualities.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Families that harmoniously work together to increase the love, appreciation and spirituality within the family circle make one of the strongest and most lasting contributions toward the spiritual growth of the whole congregation.</p>

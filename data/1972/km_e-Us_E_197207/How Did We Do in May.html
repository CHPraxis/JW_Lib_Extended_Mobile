<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">May saw a fine demonstration of wholehearted effort to “let people know the prophetic truths.” There were 429,698 who shared in publicly making known those prophetic truths, and that represents an increase of more than 15,000 over May of last year! We rejoice to see them share with us in the most vital work being performed on the earth today. During the month, 560,121 books were placed, a large percentage of them no doubt being “‘The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah’​—How?”, which so forcefully emphasizes God’s prophetic purpose as respects his own name. A fine witness was given!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING JULY 9</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Theme: Praise Jehovah “in the Intimate Group of Upright Ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:1-19:111:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 111:1</a>. Song 111.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"> <strong>8 min: </strong>Introduction, text and comments. Include accounts report.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"> <strong>7 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201972247/">Small, but Powerful</a>.” Enthusiastic talk. Inform the congregation about territories that have not been worked recently and suggest that they talk to the brother who assigns territory about some they could work during the summer.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201972241/">Praising Jehovah in Assemblies</a>.” Questions and answers.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201972245/">Family Contributions to Congregation Spirituality</a>.” Two families visit together; activities of the congregation are the topic of conversation. The two family heads are pleased with the good effort made by their households but they feel there is more they can do to help the congregation grow stronger spiritually. They reason that congregation spirituality is actually the result of the operation of Jehovah’s spirit upon those within it, and its members can help best by simply cultivating the fruitage of that spirit in their personal lives. To the extent that each family unit can do that, the congregation will be strengthened. These brothers lead their families in lively, informal discussion of the article, encouraging each family member to express himself on ways that the suggestions can be personally applied.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This discussion prompts parents to comment about the responsibility they have to take the lead and be diligent in their oversight of spiritual matters in the home. Observation is made that each household should have a definite program to keep the family strong. Suggestion is made that all turn to the “Aid” book (page 312 par. 6) to review the fundamentals of instruction maintained in the ancient Israelite household and which proved to be successful in keeping the family united in true worship. Children join in discussion, expressing their willingness to cooperate with parents. Session concludes with comments on how the whole congregation would benefit if each family would strengthen its spirituality by this means.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING JULY 30</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Theme: Let “the Tested Quality of Your Faith” Win Praise from God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>. Song 26.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Offering the “Great Teacher” Book. August will mark the first time this book has been featured as the main offer; a wide distribution can accomplish much good.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">There are numerous ways to offer it. Presentations that are simple and direct usually get the best response. When talking to parents, you can appeal to their natural concern about the welfare and future of their family. If you wish to use a scripture, you could refer to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a> or perhaps <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>, emphasizing the mutual blessings to be gained by a personal interest in their children. (Some excellent talking points are found on pages 5 and 6.) The illustration on page 1 may prompt a concerned parent to think seriously about why he should imitate Jesus’ loving interest and take advantage of the help provided by this “Great Teacher.” You could mention the disturbing emotional pressures confronting young people in this chaotic society and draw attention to the vital lessons they need to learn from their parents. Various chapters in the book focus on such qualities as faith in God (chap. 3), obedience (chap. 7), forgiveness (chap. 15), truthfulness (chap. 17), love for others (chap. 19), peaceableness (chap. 32), and generosity (chap. 35). (Briefly review additional suggestions offered in the June “Kingdom Ministry,” page 2.) Demonstrate one or two brief presentations as time permits.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Encourage publishers to carry extra copies with them, being alert to offer more than one when several in the family show interest. Also, suggest the possibility of making just a simple offer of the book for 25 cents when the householder is busy. Comment on the fine opportunity available for younger publishers to share in a wide distribution.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>Why Faith Is Needed. (“Aid,” pp. 561, 562) Audience discussion, using the questions here. Our entire life course as servants of Jehovah should be governed by faith. This will enable us to overcome mountainlike obstacles that would hinder our serving him. So it is good for us to consider just what faith is, why it is needed and how it can aid us to preserve a proper relationship with our heavenly Father. (a) What is faith? (“Aid,” p. 561, pars. 2-4) (b) Why is faith in Jehovah’s existence not enough to gain his approval? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:19-59:2:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:19</a>) (c) Why is it important for us to have faith in the power of prayer?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:25-19:37:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) (i) Why will faith in Jehovah help us to avoid stumbling others or being stumbled by what imperfect humans do or say? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:165-19:119:165" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 119:165;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:13-45:14:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Rom. 14:13-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:21-45:14:23" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 21-23</a>) (j) How can faith help young people to avoid becoming unduly involved in extracurricular activities at school?

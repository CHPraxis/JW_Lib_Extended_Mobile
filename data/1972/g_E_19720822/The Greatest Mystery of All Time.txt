The Greatest Mystery of All Time
It is a mystery that involves your own life. It affects the entire world of mankind.
This mystery is described in the prophetic Bible book of Revelation. The explanation is given in the fascinating, 384-page, hard-covered book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” You should read this book. Send only 50c.
Please send me “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God,” for which I enclose 50c. Send also the gift booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

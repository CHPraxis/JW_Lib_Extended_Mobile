<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">(5 min.) Chairman briefly discusses other ways “Great Teacher” book can be featured: Grandparents and others can give copies of it as gifts to child relatives, if no children are now in home; or gifts can be made to children of close friends. This may be just the way to reach a certain family you know. If person has poor education, book can be used to help him learn truth, as well as to improve his reading and comprehension. Sometimes might show book to young person if parents are not at home, and then return to see parents later. Offering book in street witnessing is also effective. Take advantage of all opportunities to place the “Great Teacher” book and the “New World Translation.”</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"> <strong>5 min: </strong>Introduction, text and comments.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Offer the “Truth” Book in July. Has everyone in your territory had the opportunity to get the “Truth” book? To make sure, we will make a special effort to cover all the territory in July with this fine Bible study aid. Where you find that individuals already have it, you might want to offer either the “Great Teacher” or “Evolution” book. Of course, you will want to be alert to start studies in the “Truth” book where they have it already. The important thing is that they have in their hands an instrument that will hold their attention and help them to learn the truth. One publication may interest them more than another. Hence, in addition to taking along with you a good supply of the “Truth” book, take along several copies of the other two books as alternative offers.</p>

(“Aid,” pp. 993-995) By means of the following questions, help the audience to see why it is important to cultivate kindness. It will not be necessary to have all the scriptures read. Be sure, however, that the key points in the texts used are made clear. Time the discussion so that each question gets a fair share of the time allotted. (a) What is kindness? (“Aid,” p. 993, par. 12) (b) What is undeserved kindness? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:4-45:4:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 4:4</a>; “Aid,” pp. 994, 995) (c) Why should those wanting God’s approval reflect kindness? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:14-18:6:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mic. 6:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Gal. 5:22</a>) (d) What should motivate us to express kindness?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Col. 3:12, 13</a>) (f) What reasoning respecting Jehovah’s undeserved kindness can help us to resist temptation?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jude 4-7</a>) (h) How do young folks in the world often show a lack of kindness toward others of their own age? In what way can Christian youths show kindness to those of their age group? to older persons? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:13-45:3:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 3:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:1-54:5:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:1, 2</a>) (i) Why will appreciation of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness move us to be diligent in declaring the good news?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Looking over our April report, we find much to make our hearts rejoice. First, there was a new high of 431,179 publishers, 6,868 more than the peak registered in March and 14,390 more publishers than April a year ago! Isn’t it grand that there are this many people interested in magnifying Jehovah’s name by sharing in the Kingdom service?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">April was a big magazine month, and we had two special issues along with other fine ones. What did we do with them? We put them into the hands of the public to the number of 9,888,126! Just think how much good they can do. During the four-month subscription campaign, 475,982 subscriptions were also obtained. For the most part, these new subscriptions are going to households from which no one is coming to our meetings. Really, what a fine witness was given, aiding others to break clean from false religion and to fix their hope on God’s new order so near at hand!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As a springboard for our April work we had the special public talk and the Memorial late in March. Total Memorial attendance rose to 976,233​—an 8.3-percent increase, or 75,038 more persons than last year! Isn’t that encouraging? The number of partakers decreased by 37, for a total of 4,559. The Memorial truly impressed on our minds how the Lord Jesus set the example in vindicating God by maintaining integrity. Also, there was a new peak attendance of 689,878 at the special talk, an increase of 15,076 over last year.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You are to be commended for your fine share in theocratic activity. Now we have another grand privilege before us, that of attending one of the “Divine Rulership” District Assemblies. Surely we will not want to miss this marvelous spiritual feast! Indeed, we have many things to make our hearts rejoice. How blessed are those who maintain integrity!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

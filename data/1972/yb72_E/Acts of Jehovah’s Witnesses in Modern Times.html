<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We always enjoy reading the Acts of Apostles as set forth in God’s written Word. Why not observe what is going on now.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Jesus said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,” <span id="page46" class="pageNum" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>he was assigning his faithful followers a tremendous work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19</a>) But in the days following the death of Christ Jesus they applied themselves to this work. The preaching of this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness to all the nations must also be done in these “last days,” before the “end” comes. It warms a Christian’s heart to see how the faithful servants of Jehovah have opened up the work in different lands, even as did the apostle Paul, Barnabas, Silas and many others whose acts have been recorded in the Bible. This year we have selected seven countries, representing the eastern and western hemispheres, the north and the south, and some of the islands of the sea. What you read concerning these seven countries should give you the feel of the marvelous work that Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing even to the ends of the earth from their very early beginning until now.</p>

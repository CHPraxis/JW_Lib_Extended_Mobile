Announcements
◆ With the March 15 pioneer letter, regular pioneers serving since February 1, 1972, will be sent a cafeteria ticket for use at a district assembly during this service year. Special pioneers will receive theirs in April.
◆ Immediately after the Memorial, congregation servants should be sure to mail the report card showing public meeting and Memorial attendance figures to the Society.
◆ Spring cleaning for the Bethel home is scheduled for Saturday morning, April 15, 1972. The Bethel home and factory will be closed at that time. So, no tours will be taken on that day.
◆ Literature offer for May: ‘Know Jehovah’ book, and a booklet, for fifty cents. For June: New World Translation, and the Great Teacher book, for $1.25; or just the Great Teacher book, for twenty-five cents. For July: Truth book, for twenty-five cents.
◆ Congregations may find it beneficial to stock a copy of the large-print New World Translation (bi8) and Aid to Bible Understanding, even though they are cash items. Then if a publisher gets an order, delivery can be made the following week; and the literature servant can then order another one to replace it. You may want to have some of these items available for the work in June.
◆ New Publications Available:
Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God—​Arabic, Cebuano, Efik, Iloko, Tagalog
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life​—Hausa, Lingala, Samoan, Tumbuka

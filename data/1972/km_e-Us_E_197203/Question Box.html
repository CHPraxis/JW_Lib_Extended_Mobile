<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What are some of the things that the attendant at Kingdom Hall meetings can do to be of service to the congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Generally, attendants are alert to aid latecomers to find seats, and they may make note of the attendance. It is a fine thing when they also make it a point to get acquainted with newcomers and then introduce them to some of the servants, as well as to other publishers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The ventilation of the Kingdom Hall is essential if all are to be comfortable. It is appreciated when the attendant is alert to see that it is not too hot or too cold in the hall and that the air is not stuffy. This may require some attention well before the meeting begins.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Maintaining order during the meetings is essential, and the attendant can do much to help with this. Where children become unruly, the attendant ought to ask the parent in a kindly way to take the child out so the audience will not be unduly distracted. Even before the meeting, parents with young children can be encouraged to sit where they will cause the least distraction if it is necessary to take the children out to discipline them or to care for other needs.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since the conduct of children inside, as well as outside, the Kingdom Hall can reflect favorably or unfavorably on the congregation, the attendant can, where necessary, remind parents to give proper supervision, not letting the children run there. This often needs to be done during the period when those in attendance are visiting with one another after the meeting is dismissed.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The services performed by the attendant obviously can contribute much to everyone’s enjoyment of the meetings. Where possible, it is desirable to use as attendants those who are fine representatives of the congregation and who themselves have had experience in handling situations that arise in family life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:8-54:3:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:12-54:3:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12, 13</a>.</p>

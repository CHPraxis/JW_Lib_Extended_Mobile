Will You Have Enough?
1 At least two subjects are of the keenest interest to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. One is the impending destruction of “Babylon the Great.” Another is the prospect of deliverance in the very near future into God’s new order. Not only are we interested in these matters, others urgently need to learn about them.
2 It is these subjects that provide the basis for the special issues of the magazines that we will be giving wide distribution during the month of April. The April 15 Watchtower features the thrilling subject, “Mankind’s Deliverance into God’s New Order.” And the April 22 Awake! is on the theme, “Where Is Religion Leading Mankind?” Don’t you agree that this is information that people everywhere urgently need? Will you have enough copies for distribution?
3 Why not set a personal goal as to the number of these special issues you want to distribute. Be sure that you have ordered an ample supply. If you have not yet done so, may we suggest that you do it now. Then look to Jehovah to bless your efforts to make full use of these instruments to make known His will.

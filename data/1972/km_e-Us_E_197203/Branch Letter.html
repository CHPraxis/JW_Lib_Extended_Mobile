<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Fellow Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In our last letter we told you that Brothers Knorr and Larson were on a special trip around the world. The first half of their trip (from Brooklyn, New York, to Kenya, East Africa) might best be described as a whirlwind of activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">They left here on January 5 and stopped briefly in Jamaica before flying to Peru. Staying there less than 24 hours, they flew on to Chile for a day. Then to Buenos Aires (Argentina) and São Paulo (Brazil) before leaving for Dakar in West Africa. Across Africa their pace was just as fast as across South America​—only a few days at any one place. They left Dakar (Senegal) on January 16 and stopped at Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Accra (Ghana), Lagos (Nigeria) and finally arrived in Nairobi (Kenya) on January 26.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During the daytime our traveling brothers worked in the branch offices, and at night, if not flying on to the next country, they spoke to local gatherings of brothers, or they showed slides of the new developments in this country to the missionaries.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Some of these branches have needed much attention due to the tremendous growth in the work. For example, in Brazil (where the present branch home is only five years old) it is necessary to build another with expanded printing facilities to care for the 72,000 publishers in that country. Just think of it, only five years ago they had but 41,548 publishers on the average! Similarly, in Ghana and Nigeria construction of printing facilities is under way because of growth in the organization.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the meantime the Brooklyn Bethel Family has been working hard getting out the annual bound volumes and the <em>1972 Yearbook. </em>So far 944,000 <em>Yearbooks </em>have been produced, up some 127,000 over last year. Approximately 2,700,000 <em>‘Know Jehovah’ </em>books have also gone through the bindery. We are glad that we can supply your needs.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Be assured of our warm love.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

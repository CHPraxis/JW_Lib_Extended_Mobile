How Did We Do in January?
There were severe weather conditions in some parts of the country. Also, there was quite a bit of sickness during January. Even so, over 5 1⁄2 million hours were devoted to the field ministry. Almost 7 million magazines were placed during the month, and 117,415 subscriptions were obtained. A fine witness was given.

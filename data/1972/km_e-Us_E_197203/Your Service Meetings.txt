13 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include consideration of Branch Letter.
20 min: Training Younger Ones to Sit Quietly and Listen. The audience can be asked to comment on following points: Why do we attend meetings? (Heb. 10:23-25) What do we learn from Deuteronomy 31:12? Parents are encouraged to bring children to meetings even though they are very young. They need to be at the meetings with us. Who has the responsibility to train children to sit quietly and listen at meetings? (Eph. 6:4; Prov. 29:15) Is worldly viewpoint of permissiveness in dealing with children in harmony with what is stated at Proverbs 22:15 and Proverbs 23:13, 14? (It is to be expected that there will be some disturbances until newer ones are helped to apply Bible principles in training and disciplining children. Also, young ones may be “teething” or not feeling well, etc.) Why is consistent home training needed? How could children become confused if required to sit quietly only when at meetings and then not be given any discipline at home? Ask for suggestions as to how younger ones can be trained at home to sit quietly. (Perhaps mother can progressively train child to sit quietly while she does personal study, etc.) Consider principle at Matthew 5:37 and how it applies in home training, as well as at Kingdom Hall. Why would it be best not to provide children with noisy playthings to keep them occupied at the Kingdom Hall? Should library or some other place in Kingdom Hall be used as a playroom? Why would it be best to administer certain forms of discipline outside the main meeting area of the Kingdom Hall?
Where necessary servants can talk to parents privately, giving warm encouragement and suggestions on training and discipline.
 5 min: Talk on material in “Question Box.”
22 min: Some Ways that the Ransom Affects Us Personally.
(3 min.) Chairman: Every year we celebrate the Memorial. It is a big event on our calendar. But how deeply does the death of Christ, which we commemorate, affect our lives as individuals? It has moved us to make changes. Being imperfect, we need to continue making them. Appreciation for the ransom should deeply influence everything we do. It should deter us from wrongdoing. It should be an incentive for us to cultivate greater love for our brothers. And, it should move us to put forth a real effort to help others to benefit from God’s provision for life.
In scenes that follow, we will see common situations. After each scene, the audience will be asked to comment on it, reading from the Bible and discussing how what it says about the ransom can help us to do what is right.
(7 min.) One sister approaches another, in an offhand way apologizing for being late. Irritated, another sister replies: “Never do keep your word; last time I’ll wait for you.” Chairman asks: How could awareness of ransom have helped both of these sisters? Audience may base comments on the following points: Regarding undependable sister, show that, if we are imitating Christ, we put ourselves out for others, instead of expecting others to wait on us (Matt. 20:28); Christ appreciated the importance of doing things on time (John 7:8; Rom. 5:6); his followers must learn to be prompt and not expect everything to wait for them. (Matt. 25:10-12) For other sister, show forgiveness that ransom makes possible and how this should affect our attitude toward offenders.​—1 John 1:7-9; 2:1; Matt. 18:33-35.
(3 min.) Employer approaches brother requesting that he not enter certain receipts in the books. Chairman asks: How will brother’s appreciation of ransom help him to resist temptation to please boss by agreeing to dishonesty? From audience draw out comments on value of ransom and danger of deliberately getting involved in sin.​—1 Pet. 1:17-19; Heb. 10:26, 27.
(5 min.) Brother relaxing, contemplating ways to share in the field activity because busy days ahead with special public talk and Memorial. Chairman asks: How does real appreciation for ransom help a person to reason in such an upbuilding way? Draw out from audience comments on extent of ransom provision and our obligation toward others.​—1 Cor. 10:33; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4; 1 John 2:2-4; Rev. 22:17.
(4 min.) Chairman: Summation of points, stressing need to keep ransom provision before us to preserve right relationship with God. Give reminders on arrangements for the Memorial celebration. Encourage publishers to invite and bring others to special public talk and to Memorial. Make any other needed announcements. Song 83.

(To have God’s approval, to represent him properly to others, we need to manifest that fruit of God’s spirit​—peace. As ministers we want to help others, both our families and others to whom we speak, to come into and maintain a peaceful relationship with Jehovah and fellowmen. So, we need to appreciate why peace with Jehovah is important, how we can continue pursuing peace and what rewards it brings.) (a) Why is it vital for us to be at peace with Jehovah? (1 Pet. 3:10-12; w59, p. 743, par. 9) (b) How can one come to be at peace with God? (2 Pet. 1:2, 3; Col. 1:19-23) (c) How do some persons who were at peace with God get to be at enmity with him? (Rom. 8:6-8) (d) If we are to continue enjoying peace with Jehovah, what should be our attitude regarding his laws? (Ps. 119:165; Isa. 48:18) (e) Why is the oft-repeated Bible expression, ‘May you have peace,’ so appropriate? (1 Cor. 1:3; Gal. 6:16) (f) What wholesome effect does the “peace of God” have on us as individuals? (Phil. 4:6, 7; “Aid,” p. 1280, par. 5) (g) What should we do personally to contribute to the peace of the congregation? (Eph. 4:1-3; Rom. 14:13-20) (h) When does the pursuit of peace require waging spiritual warfare inside the congregation? (2 Cor. 10:4-6) (i) In our contacts with persons outside the congregation, how can we promote peace? (Matt. 10:12, 13; Rom. 12:17-19, 21; 2 Cor. 5:20) (j) How does our attitude toward governments of the world reflect our viewpoint toward peace? (Isa. 2:4; Rom. 13:1; 1 Tim. 2:1-4; w59, p. 751, par. 9)

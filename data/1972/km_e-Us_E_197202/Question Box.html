<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is each publisher encouraged to have his own personal subscription for “The Watchtower” and “Awake!”?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many of our brothers are now getting their “Watchtower” and “Awake!” magazines at the Kingdom Hall. We encourage this arrangement. It saves the Society a tremendous amount of work and it saves you money.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We will try to get new subscriptions from people who do not regularly attend meetings at the congregation​—people with whom we conduct Bible studies or on whom we make back-calls, friends, relatives and people we meet in the house-to-house work. They should be encouraged to obtain subscriptions for the magazines. But after they are publishers and are attending meetings regularly, they might be encouraged to get their magazines from the magazine counter.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For some this will mean quite an adjustment. And there will be a need for us to get into the good habit of going to the magazine counter each week to pick up the latest copies of “The Watchtower” or “Awake!” for our personal use and for distribution in the field. Don’t neglect it and then find later that members of your family missed out on an issue and the supply at the Kingdom Hall is gone. Rather, begin now to make it a regular part of your activity at the Kingdom Hall to stop at the magazine counter each week for your latest copies of “The Watchtower” and “Awake!”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Individuals wanting the magazines sent directly to their homes should not be discouraged from subscribing. People may have good reasons for wanting to have the magazines sent by mail to their homes. But, as mentioned above, it will mean less work for the Society and it will save you money if you obtain your individual copies of the magazines at the Kingdom Hall.</p>

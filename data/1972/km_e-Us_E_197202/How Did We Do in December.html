<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We were offering the “New World Translation” along with the book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” And, before the month ended, we had placed 720,407 of them. What a fine effect these can have on God-fearing people! Of course, our initial call was a witness to Jehovah’s name and purpose. Now, as we call back, we may be able to help some to become true supporters of Jehovah’s kingship.</p>

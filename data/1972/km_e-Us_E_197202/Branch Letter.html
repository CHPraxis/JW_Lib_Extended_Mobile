<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Fellow Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You probably know that during the past several months there has been a readjustment in the size and boundaries of the circuits. And so, as of February 1 we have about ninety fewer circuits throughout the continental United States than before​—a total now of 265, divided into 23 districts.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This change means that the circuit servant will not be visiting your congregation as often as before​—only twice instead of three times a year. You can understand the wisdom of this in the light of the reorganization of the congregations. With the local body of elders taking on and carrying a heavier load of responsibility in each congregation, it will not be necessary for circuit servants to come around so often.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This makes it possible to transfer about ninety of the brothers from the circuit work to other assignments in the field. In the past these brothers have been a great help to the congregations, for not only has their counsel been very much appreciated, but also their example of faith, zeal and devotion has been an encouragement to others. It is good to know, then, that we are not losing the years of experience of these capable brothers, but instead the organization will be able to use their valuable services in other parts of the field. The organization certainly needs these “gifts in men” in this critical time of the end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">On January 5 Brothers Knorr and Larson left for a special round-the-world trip. Before they get back they will have visited countries in South America, Africa and the Far East. They should return about February 20. A number of these countries are in the course of building printing plants and enlarging their Bethel homes. In connection with such a program many problems have to be worked out.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This expansion is all due to the urgent need to inform people everywhere that “Jehovah himself has become king.” As the world situation grows ever more desperate the need to let the people know the true solution becomes greater. Therefore, more theocratic printing facilities all around the world!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Be assured of our warm love, as you allow God to finish your training,</p>

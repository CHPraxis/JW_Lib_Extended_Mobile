<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Get Acquainted with Prospective Subscribers.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Chairman: We are always happy when in house-to-house work we find someone who will subscribe for “The Watchtower.” Often we find that these people know something about the work. They may have talked to the brothers before or had previous copies of the magazines. Most of us have observed, however, that there is a hesitancy on the part of many people to subscribe at the first contact. So it is suggested that we put forth an effort to get well acquainted with prospective subscribers during March.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Whenever interest is noted or when a person takes the two magazines, make a record of it. Then when the new issues come out, take them back, drawing the attention of the householder to a subject you believe may interest him. It may be very effective to draw attention to an article that particularly appealed to you. Make your call friendly. Show interest in the other person. Endeavor to build confidence in God’s Word. Help the householder to see how he can be personally benefited by reading the magazines.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">As you bring the new magazines and engage in friendly conversation during March and April, it may be that you can build a strong enough acquaintance with the person, and build a great enough interest in the Bible and the subjects discussed in “The Watchtower” so the person will see the value of subscribing. Make this one of your goals during March and April.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Include two brief presentations: (1) The householder refuses the subscription but accepts the two current magazines, saying he would like to read them. (2) Publisher makes friendly call to stimulate interest and bring new magazines to person previously met in house-to-house work.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Chairman: Lead discussion with questions. Allow audience to comment freely; encourage them to do so and to use scriptures in their comments if they wish. (Based on “When a Christian Is in Business” in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1971925/1-33">December 15, 1971, “Watchtower,” pages 764-767</a>.

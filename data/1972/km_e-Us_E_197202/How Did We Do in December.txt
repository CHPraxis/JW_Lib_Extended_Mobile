How Did We Do in December?
We were offering the “New World Translation” along with the book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” And, before the month ended, we had placed 720,407 of them. What a fine effect these can have on God-fearing people! Of course, our initial call was a witness to Jehovah’s name and purpose. Now, as we call back, we may be able to help some to become true supporters of Jehovah’s kingship.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>During February, March and April the literature offer is, of course, primarily the <em>Watchtower </em>subscription for one year, with three booklets as a premium, for $1.50. If, however, in your judgment it is just as easy to offer a subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>with six booklets, for $3.00, do not hesitate to do so.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>During the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign, it is suggested that we carry one or two copies of the pocket-sized publications, such as <em>Truth, Evolution, Word of God, Great Teacher, </em>with us. Then, if people do not take the subscriptions, one of these books may be offered with two magazines on a contribution of $.35.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If you prefer, you may carry the <em>‘Know Jehovah’ </em>book or some other $.50 publication and offer it with two magazines for $.60. In fact, the congregation servant can see that announcement is made concerning what books are in stock in the congregation. If they are older publications or newer ones, it makes no difference. We can carry these publications along with us in addition to the magazines, and we can offer them along with the magazines for $.60 if a person does not wish to subscribe. We want to help people to learn the truth and we have many publications to help them. We pray that Jehovah will bless you as you use them well.</p>

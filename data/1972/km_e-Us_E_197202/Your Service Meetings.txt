20 min: “Kingdom Ministry” insert from heading “Why Do Some Drop Out?” to the end. Questions and answers.
10 min: Get Acquainted with Prospective Subscribers.
Chairman: We are always happy when in house-to-house work we find someone who will subscribe for “The Watchtower.” Often we find that these people know something about the work. They may have talked to the brothers before or had previous copies of the magazines. Most of us have observed, however, that there is a hesitancy on the part of many people to subscribe at the first contact. So it is suggested that we put forth an effort to get well acquainted with prospective subscribers during March.
Whenever interest is noted or when a person takes the two magazines, make a record of it. Then when the new issues come out, take them back, drawing the attention of the householder to a subject you believe may interest him. It may be very effective to draw attention to an article that particularly appealed to you. Make your call friendly. Show interest in the other person. Endeavor to build confidence in God’s Word. Help the householder to see how he can be personally benefited by reading the magazines.
As you bring the new magazines and engage in friendly conversation during March and April, it may be that you can build a strong enough acquaintance with the person, and build a great enough interest in the Bible and the subjects discussed in “The Watchtower” so the person will see the value of subscribing. Make this one of your goals during March and April.
Include two brief presentations: (1) The householder refuses the subscription but accepts the two current magazines, saying he would like to read them. (2) Publisher makes friendly call to stimulate interest and bring new magazines to person previously met in house-to-house work.
23 min: Be Free from the Love of Money. (Heb. 13:5) Audience discussion.
Chairman: Lead discussion with questions. Allow audience to comment freely; encourage them to do so and to use scriptures in their comments if they wish. (Based on “When a Christian Is in Business” in the December 15, 1971, “Watchtower,” pages 764-767. While this material was considered briefly in concluding comments on a previous occasion, this part of the program will provide opportunity for personal application of the material and for it to be impressed on the minds of all.)
From Jehovah’s standpoint, what is the main purpose of our being alive? (Isa. 43:10, 12; Phil. 2:15) In contrast with the viewpoint of people in the world, what is the purpose of a business as far as one of Jehovah’s servants is concerned? (2 Thess. 3:10; 1 Tim. 5:8; 2 Cor. 8:21) What danger is there in becoming too involved in business? (1 Tim. 6:9; 1 Pet. 5:8) (If desired, someone can read paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 of the article.)
Why should borrowing be avoided? (Rom. 13:8; Prov. 22:7; Ps. 37:21) Why should written agreements be made? (Ps. 103:14; Jer. 32:10, 11) What should be taken into consideration by person in a position to lend money? (Prov. 28:27; Jas. 2:14-16; Prov. 22:7, 26, 27) What can be said in favor of self-sufficiency?​—1 Tim. 6:6-8; Phil. 4:11-13; Matt. 6:33; Heb. 13:5, 6.
Concluding comments. Song 42.

13 min: “Presenting the Good News​—By Happiness in Giving.” Questions and answers. If there are other local experiences, you may want to include some of these.
10 min: Are You Reading the New “Yearbook”? Invite congregation to look in as family read “Yearbook” together. Read four paragraphs from page 154, paragraph 3 to heading “Operating Under Ban.” Use a good, expressive reader. After reading, family head asks: “How could we witness and have meetings if we were under ban?” (1 Cor. 10:13) Allow for comments from family members.
Chairman: Encourage reading of “Yearbook.” Do not miss out on encouraging reports from the seven countries reported on in the “Yearbook.”
25 min: Joy from Jehovah. Audience discussion using questions below, it is not intended that all scriptures be read, but they will stimulate thought and give the brothers much to talk about.
It is suggested that questions “a” to “e” be covered in the first eight minutes. This will allow for more answers to questions “f” to “j” and it will allow time for the brothers to read and comment on key texts you may select. (a) What is joy? (See “Aid” page 969.) (b) What are some of the things that bring joy to Jehovah’s heart? (Ps. 104:31; Prov. 27:11) To Jesus and to the angels? (Luke 15:7, 10; 10:1, 17, 21) (c) What is the source of our joy? (Jas. 1:17; Gal. 5:22) (d) What primarily brings us joy? (Ps. 64:10; Jer. 9:24; Ps. 40:8) (e) What else has Jehovah provided for the joy and happiness of man? (Ps. 20:5; Phil. 4:1; Rom. 12:12. See also Prov. 5:18; 23:24, 25; Eccl. 10:19) (f) How is it possible that our field service to Jehovah is with joy of heart and not burdensome? (Acts 20:35; Matt. 22:37, 39; Jer. 15:16; Luke 2:10) (g) How is it that attending meetings brings joy to Jehovah’s people? (Matt. 18:20; Ps. 19:8; Heb. 10:24, 25) (h) How is it possible to have joy when enduring persecution with integrity? (Jas. 1:2-4; Matt. 5:11, 12; Prov. 27:11; 1 Pet. 4:13, 14; Rom. 12:12) (i) Of what physical benefit is it to Jehovah’s people to experience such heartfelt joy? (Prov. 15:13; 17:22) (j) What are some of the joys Jehovah has set ahead of us? (Ps. 145:1; Rev. 21:1-4; John 5:28, 29)

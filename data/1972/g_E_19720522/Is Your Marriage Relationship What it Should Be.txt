Is Your Marriage Relationship What it Should Be?
Every wife wants a happy marriage. To achieve this, it is necessary for her, as well as her husband, to have a clear understanding of the responsibilities of each in the marriage relationship. Mutual love, respect and concern are necessary for a happy marriage.
Many couples, though faced with serious marital problems, have saved their marriages with the help of the fine marriage counsel found in the Bible. You will find a helpful consideration of this counsel in the book Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. This hard-covered book of 416 pages will be sent to you postpaid for 50c.
Please send me Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God, for which I enclose 50c. Send also the gift booklet God’s Way Is Love.

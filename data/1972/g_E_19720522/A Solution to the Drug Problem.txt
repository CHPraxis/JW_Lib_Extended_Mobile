A Solution to the Drug Problem
Drug addicts need a strong incentive to quit the drug habit. They need something to live for instead of trying to escape from reality.
Something that is really worth living for and that gives real meaning to life is set out in detail in the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. This hard-covered book of 192 pages will be sent postpaid for only 25c.
Please send me The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for which I enclose 25c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Every wife wants a happy marriage. To achieve this, it is necessary for her, as well as her husband, to have a clear understanding of the responsibilities of each in the marriage relationship. Mutual love, respect and concern are necessary for a happy marriage.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many couples, though faced with serious marital problems, have saved their marriages with the help of the fine marriage counsel found in the Bible. You will find a helpful consideration of this counsel in the book <strong>Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </strong>This hard-covered book of 416 pages will be sent to you postpaid for 50c.</p>

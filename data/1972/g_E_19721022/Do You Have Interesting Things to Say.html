<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many people like to talk, but few have anything worth while to say. Still others have difficulty in keeping a conversation going, because their knowledge of any one subject is rather limited.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">By reading <strong>Awake! </strong>magazine regularly you can solve this problem in your own case. It has penetrating articles on world problems and social conditions. Interesting and unusual news items from all over the world appear in each issue. Practical sciences and the marvels of creation are discussed as well as customs and peoples in many lands.</p>

Why Read the Bible?
Even if you are not a Christian you have good reason for examining the Bible. It deals with matters that vitally affect you​—your personal welfare, your happiness, your security. In its pages is found satisfying discussion of the purpose of life.
Is the Bible actually from God? The 192-page book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? will help you to examine the evidence. Send only 25c.
Please send me the hard-covered book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for which I enclose 25c.

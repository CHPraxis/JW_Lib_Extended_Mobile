They Recognized the Truth
ABOUT 1,900 years ago many honest-hearted Jewish priests accepted the truth proclaimed by the followers of Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us: “The word of God went on growing, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying in Jerusalem very much; and a great crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.” (Acts 6:7) Also today numerous clergymen are responding favorably to the activity of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses.
In a Latin-American country, a man who came to a small city to shop obtained literature from Jehovah’s witnesses. He and his family had some difficulty in understanding it. So they asked their Pentecostal clergyman for an explanation, but he was unable to help them. For this reason they requested that one of Jehovah’s witnesses come to help them. The Witness who responded to their invitation was greeted warmly by a group of twenty-two persons, including the clergyman, assembled in the church. They wanted to know about Christ’s coming. After an hour and ten minutes of Biblical discussion on this subject, they voiced their agreement, acknowledging that everything was clear.
The following week the Witness delivered the discourse “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” Those hearing this talk understood that true Christians should be bearers of the name “Jehovah.” Arrangements were made to study the Bible with the aid of the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Shortly afterward the clergyman said he wanted to get baptized because he realized that his former baptism was valueless. He was baptized in February of 1971 and eight former church members are sharing with him in proclaiming to others the things they have learned from the Bible.

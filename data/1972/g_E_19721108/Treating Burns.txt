Treating Burns
◆ Recently a letter was received at the offices of the publishers of Awake! It was from a reader in Wisconsin. He said:
“Last Sunday my wife was making coffee, and as she removed the filter it dropped. Coffee and coffee grounds spilled all over [my daughter] Judy’s right arm. My wife quickly washed the grounds off our daughter’s arm. Yet her arm seemed scalded and Judy was in a lot of pain. I remembered reading in the Awake! magazine [the issue of July 22, 1966] that cold water was the best thing for burns. I quickly put a cold washcloth on her arm and filled the kitchen sink with cold water. When Judy put her arm in the cold water, she immediately experienced relief.
“I could see a large patch of skin was blistered, so I decided to call our doctor. The first thing he asked me was: ‘What are you doing for it?’ I explained that she had her arm submerged in cold water. ‘Excellent,’ he said. Then he asked to see us later that same morning. In the meantime Judy was to keep her arm in the water. Later we went to the doctor’s office and he put some medication on the arm. But he was very impressed that we knew about the water treatment. I told him that I had read it in Awake! magazine. All he could say was, ‘Marvelous.’
“I couldn’t help but be thankful that we had faithfully read the magazines as they came to us.”

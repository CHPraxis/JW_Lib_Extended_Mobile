A Survival Trick
● Writing in Outdoor Life, a man related how he thought he owed his life to a survival trick told to him by an old trapper. If forced by circumstances to stay outdoors overnight during very cold weather, the trapper said, “take your coat off, pull your cap down, put the coat over it and button it up, and fold your arms inside. With a little fire at your feet, you can keep warm all night.”

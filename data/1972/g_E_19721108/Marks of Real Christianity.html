<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ALMOST anyone would agree that a large church or long-standing church membership does not mean one has the marks of real Christianity. But what truly should those marks be? Note the observations made by E. M. Green in his book about evangelism among early Christians:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One of the most striking features in evangelism in the early days was the people who engaged in it. Communicating the faith was not regarded as the preserve of the very zealous or of the officially designated evangelist. Evangelism was the prerogative and the duty of every Church member. We have seen apostles and wandering prophets, nobles and paupers, intellectuals and fishermen all taking part enthusiastically in this the primary task committed by Christ to his Church. The ordinary people of the Church saw it as their job: Christianity was supremely a lay movement, spread by informal missionaries. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“This infectious enthusiasm on the part of such diverse people of differing ages, backgrounds, sex, and cultures was backed up by the quality of their lives. Their love, their joy, their changed habits and progressively transformed characters gave great weight to what they had to say.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hence, zealous evangelizing by all in a congregation, by old and young, as well as the evidences of real Christian transformation​—these are marks of true Christianity.</p>

The Body’s Amazing Reflex Action
◆ The body’s capability of performing reflex actions is a safety factor, often preventing further injury. For example, were a hot coal to fall on your toe, sensory nerve impulses would travel to the spinal cord and there make contact with motor nerves. The motor nerves then would route the impulses to muscle fibers in the leg. These would contract, removing the foot from the hot coal​—all this in a bare fraction of a second. This reflex action involves no conscious thought. Not until the foot draws away and the sensory nerve impulses, continuing their journey, reach the brain is pain felt. Thus in initially bypassing the brain the nerve impulses involved in reflex actions get the body out of danger almost immediately. Truly this testifies to the purposeful design of a loving Creator.

Help for Teaching Young Children
Do you have the job of caring for young children? If so, would you be grateful for some help?
You can hold children’s attention by reading to them from the book Listening to the Great Teacher. Its stories are fascinating; they also teach high moral principles. They show why it is wrong to steal or to lie or to take drugs. Children are also taught to say “Thank you” when others do things for them. This valuable 192-page, hardbound book is yours for only 25c.
Please send me Listening to the Great Teacher, for which I enclose 25c.

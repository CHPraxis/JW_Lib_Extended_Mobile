<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Writing in <em>The Expository Times, </em>Theologian Vincent Taylor acknowledges: “The Gospels clearly show that the knowledge of Jesus was limited, that He asked questions for the sake of information . . . that He challenged the rich ruler who addressed Him as ‘Good Master’ with the question, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.’ [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:18-41:10:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 10:18</a>] These issues have constantly caused embarrassment and must continue to do so if without qualification Jesus is described as God.” But they present no problem if one rejects the trinity dogma and believes what Jesus himself said, namely, that God, the Father, is greater than Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>.</p>

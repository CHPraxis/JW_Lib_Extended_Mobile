Did Jesus Really Walk on Water?
On the television screen men have been seen to float weightlessly while on trips in space. What, then, about recorded miracles in the Bible, such as Jesus’ walking on water? Could these events have really happened?
The 192-page hardbound book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? examines this and many other questions regarding the Bible’s reliability. You can obtain it along with the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, a modern English hardbound Bible of 1,472 pages, by sending only $1.25.
Please send me the hardbound book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? and the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, for which I enclose $1.25.

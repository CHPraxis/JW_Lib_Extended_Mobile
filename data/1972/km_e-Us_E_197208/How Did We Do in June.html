<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">824,065! That was the number of Bibles and books that we placed during the month of June. And how many did we place last June? 738,974. So we enjoyed placing some 85,000 more this year. As we all appreciate, such a report results from the combined efforts of all of us. Individually we may place only one or two books, and it may not seem like much. But what a tremendous amount is accomplished when we all share! And who knows how those books may affect the ones who obtained them? Some of those persons may become our brothers.</p>

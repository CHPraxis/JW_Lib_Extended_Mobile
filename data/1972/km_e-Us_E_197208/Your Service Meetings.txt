This is possible only if we reflect Jehovah’s fine qualities, including mildness or graciousness, in our dealings with fellow humans. (Ex. 34:6) (a) What is mildness? (“Aid,” p. 1156) (b) How can we acquire mildness? (Gal. 5:22, 23; “Aid,” p. 1156, par. 8) (c) How does the case of Jesus show that mildness is a quality of strength? (Matt. 11:29; 23:13-39) (d) What should give us strong motivation to manifest mildness? (Titus 3:1-7) (e) What can our displaying mildness accomplish when we have to deal with opposers? (Prov. 15:1; 25:15) (f) While the Bible speaks of clothing oneself with mildness, why can it not be said that mildness is a veneer? (Col. 3:10, 12; Eph. 4:22-24) (g) Should we be questioned by officials or teachers in a harsh manner, is mildness on our part out of place? (1 Pet. 3:15) (h) What good effect can a wife’s displaying mildness have on an unbelieving husband? (1 Pet. 3:1-5) (i) Why is mildness appropriate on the part of elders in the congregation when correction is administered? (Gal. 6:1; 2 Tim. 2:24, 25) (j) Why do we need mildness when we are corrected? (Eccl. 10:4; “Aid,” p. 1157, par. 1)

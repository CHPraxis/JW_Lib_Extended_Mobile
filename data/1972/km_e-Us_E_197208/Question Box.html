<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it all right to call alone upon one of the opposite sex if interest is manifested in the truth?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When we are doing house-to-house work, witnessing on the street or elsewhere, we witness to all who will listen, whether male or female. If interest is found, it is our desire to make arrangements for a return call to establish a home Bible study. It can be readily appreciated that some interest could not be followed up and studies started if it were said that in no case may such a call be made alone on a member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Whether one goes alone to make return visits on an interested person of the opposite sex or not is left up to each one’s discretion, depending upon various circumstances in each case. The matter of safety and avoiding wrong appearances definitely should be given due consideration. We certainly do not want to stumble others in or outside Jehovah’s organization, or put ourselves in a position of danger.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If circumstances are such that one decides to go alone, it is usually best for the call to be made or study held when the husband, wife, or another member of the family is at home.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Often circumstances may well suggest that it would be wise to take along another publisher on the call. Remember how innocent Joseph was “framed” by one of the opposite sex. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 39:7-20</a>) If circumstances suggest that you do not go alone, and it is not possible to apply the above suggestions, you can give the call to a publisher or pioneer of the same sex to handle.</p>

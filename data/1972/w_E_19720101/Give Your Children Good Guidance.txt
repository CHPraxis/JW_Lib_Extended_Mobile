Give Your Children Good Guidance
Your children need good guidance as they grow up so they can cope with the general moral breakdown among young people. The best guidance you can give them comes from the Bible. So you need to study the Bible with them regularly.
Let “The Watchtower” help you in your family Bible study.
This Bible study aid is available in seventy-three languages. Send $1.50 now and receive it twice a month for one year.
Please send me “The Watchtower” for one year, for which I enclose $1.50. Send also the gift booklets: “God’s Way Is Love,” “When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God” and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

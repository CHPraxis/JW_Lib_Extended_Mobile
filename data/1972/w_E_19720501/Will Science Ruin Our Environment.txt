Will Science Ruin Our Environment?
Science has produced many useful things, but it has also brewed bad side effects. It has caused dangerous noise pollution, water pollution and air pollution. Its war weapons, even automobiles, have destroyed millions of lives. Is there any hope for an end to such ruin?
This ruining of mankind and of our environment is due to end shortly. What will cause this lifesaving change is discussed in the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” This hard-covered book of 416 pages will help you to see what the Bible says about the immediate prospects for the earth.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you read the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>carefully? If so, you will doubtless recall these points:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● While ministerial servants are not charged with the responsibility of teaching fellow believers, why must their conduct be exemplary?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Their fine conduct removes the basis for any legitimate accusation’s being made about the congregation as to the men whom it entrusts with responsibility.​—P. 21.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● What is the symbolic mark mentioned at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 9:4</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The mark is that which identifies one as a worshiper of Jehovah, one’s having a Christlike personality.​—Pp. 49, 50.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● In Jesus’ illustration about the sower, what is meant by bearing fruitage? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 13:18-23</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This refers to making expressions about God’s kingdom, the fruitage being a manifold reproduction of the “word of the kingdom.”​—P. 91.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● How does one come into a proper relationship with Jehovah?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">By repenting of his former course of life, completely rejecting it and turning around to live in harmony with God’s will, petitioning God for a good conscience and then symbolizing this request by water baptism.​—Pp. 120, 121.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● In marriage how does a loving person ‘not look for his own interests’? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 Cor. 13:5</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">By thinking first of the feelings of one’s mate, considering the circumstances and then doing what is most advantageous for the happiness and welfare of the mate.​—P. 132.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● Why, according to </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:10-23:53:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 53:10</strong></a><strong>, did Jehovah ‘take delight in crushing his Son’?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This crushing, which terminated in Jesus’ death, had a lofty purpose in view, namely, the deliverance of mankind from sin and death. Jehovah rejoiced in the good that would result, not in his Son’s suffering.​—P. 175.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● Why does the appointment of men to serve as elders in a Christian congregation put the humility of all associated under test?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Men who are not appointed need humility to recognize their limitations; those who are appointed need humility to give due consideration to the suggestions of others and work unitedly as a body of elders. All need humility to cooperate with the elders, assisting them in the accomplishment of their work.​—Pp. 202-204.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● What benefits come from avoiding sexual immorality?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It aids one to preserve a clean conscience before God and all persons and protects one from such things as venereal disease, unwanted pregnancies, jealous fights and, possibly, even murder; also one is much more likely to have a successful marriage.​—Pp. 218-221.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>● What is the “new earth,” and who will serve as its foundation?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The “new earth” is a new and righteous human society on this very planet; the “great crowd” of Armageddon survivors will be the basis for this society organized under the “new heavens.”​—Pp. 238, 240.</p>

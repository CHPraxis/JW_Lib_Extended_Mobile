<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ At a time when demands for more leisure are increasing and respect for good hard work is declining, it is noteworthy that the Bible commends physical and mental work to accomplish a good purpose. It says “that there is nothing better than that the man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:22-21:3:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:22</a>) A key to this is developing the right outlook, for it has been observed that ‘work is not <em>work </em>if you like it.’</p>

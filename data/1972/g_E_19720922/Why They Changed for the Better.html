<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT TIMES people are heard to say, ‘I could never change my ways.’ Many have bad habits that are so deeply entrenched that nothing seems important enough to motivate them to transform their lives. But some of these persons have changed for the better. Through a study of the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, they have come to appreciate that a proper standing before Jehovah God makes life truly meaningful. This has prompted them to take the needed steps to gain that right standing by bringing their lives into harmony with God’s righteous law.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● A drug addict in the country of Luxembourg began noticing a real change in one of his friends and fellow workers. At one time this friend drank heavily, smoked and engaged in other so-called worldly pleasures. When questioned, the friend explained that he had been assisted to change his ways through a study of the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, and he often discussed the Scriptures with his fellow worker. What effect did this have on the drug addict? He himself relates:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I also decided to have a Bible study. After studying for several months I wanted to get rid of my bad habits and went to a sanatorium. But they were unable to cure me there. I returned home and immediately began studying the Bible again. I became much better acquainted with the Almighty God Jehovah and soon recognized the privilege of making my requests to him in prayer. He did not fail to assist me. After one year I was neither a drunkard nor a smoker nor a drug addict.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“At the beginning my wife was not inclined to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses. But after observing my changed conduct, she, too, decided to have a home Bible study. We spoke about the Scriptures to my mother-in-law. She knew of my former course of conduct and so she also agreed to have a home Bible study. All three of us were baptized on May 8, 1971. My mother-in-law spoke to my sister-in-law about the truth, calling attention to my former and present conduct. Today she is also studying the Bible and attending the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“When I was eighteen years old I went to work as a maid for a wealthy married couple. Little did I know that the wife could not bear any children. It became an obsession for this couple to have a family. I was seduced and in three years bore this man three children. My children were raised lacking nothing, just as though they were those of the man and woman for whom I worked. Recently, I learned about Jehovah’s witnesses through my sister and started to study the Bible with the aid of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“After the fourth study I knew that a decision had to be made. I could not continue living immorally, if I desired to gain God’s blessing and life everlasting. I decided to leave this couple and raise my three children according to a knowledge of God’s purposes. Being a maid without any financial resources, or a husband, I was criticized by many. They said that my children would have their future securely established if I would continue living with the wealthy couple. The father of my children took the case to court and succeeded in gaining custody of two of the children. But how glad I am to have brought my life into harmony with Jehovah’s will!”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● From New Zealand comes this report: Back in 1969 a Bible study was started with the mother of four children. Her husband manifested strong opposition. Then, because of breaking the law, he was imprisoned. Concerned for her husband, the wife sent him <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>A prison warden who was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses noted the arrival of the magazines and advised the Witnesses of the local congregation about this. From then on they made regular visits on the husband, lovingly aiding him to advance in accurate knowledge of God’s Word. Recently the man was released from prison. The wife anticipated the reunion with some trepidation. But when she met her husband at the airport she was amazed at the transformation in him. He had become a kind, considerate man, manifesting real Christian qualities. Since his release he has attended all the meetings of the Witnesses and has declared his intention to serve God.</p>

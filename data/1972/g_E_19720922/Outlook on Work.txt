Outlook on Work
◆ At a time when demands for more leisure are increasing and respect for good hard work is declining, it is noteworthy that the Bible commends physical and mental work to accomplish a good purpose. It says “that there is nothing better than that the man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion.” (Eccl. 3:22) A key to this is developing the right outlook, for it has been observed that ‘work is not work if you like it.’

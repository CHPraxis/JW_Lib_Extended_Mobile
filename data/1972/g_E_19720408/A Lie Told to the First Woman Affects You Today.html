<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Acceptance of that lie resulted in the unavoidable burden of sin and death for all mankind. You inherited it, and you cannot of yourself remove it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Your Creator, on the other hand, has provided the means for relieving you of this burden. But to receive that relief he requires something from you.</p>

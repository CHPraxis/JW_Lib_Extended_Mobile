A Lie Told to the First Woman Affects You Today
Acceptance of that lie resulted in the unavoidable burden of sin and death for all mankind. You inherited it, and you cannot of yourself remove it.
Your Creator, on the other hand, has provided the means for relieving you of this burden. But to receive that relief he requires something from you.
Learn about his requirements and the marvelous future he has placed before those meeting them by reading the Bible study aids “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. To obtain both of these hard-covered books, each of which has 416 pages, send only $1.
Please send me the two books “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God. Send also the gift booklets Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.” I enclose $1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Let the young children come” was the way Jesus expressed his feelings about young people of his day who were brought to him by their parents. He spoke, too, of the humble, trusting attitude displayed by young children as an example of the attitude that must be shown by those to whom the kingdom of God would belong.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:14-41:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 10:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>And, “come” you have, progressively learning and applying the things you have learned until today there are hundreds of thousands of you young people who are devotedly serving Jehovah. But did you progress to your present position on Jehovah’s side all by yourselves? No, for many of you it was likely because you have loving parents who have been teaching you God’s commands at home from infancy. Your education has continued at the Kingdom Hall, and those of you who have made the most rapid progress are the ones who have participated as fully as possible.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>You have marvelous opportunities to teach others and to make disciples at school. By example and by word you can help others your own age to see that the attitude of the “now generation” is only a further expression of the selfish spirit of this world and that the “real life” is in doing God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:19</a>) Do you recall reading in the June 15 <em>Watchtower, </em>page 381, of the two young sisters in the United Arab Republic who by their conduct set such a fine example that ten other youngsters came to be interested in studying? Does your own conduct compare favorably with that of these young sisters?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>We recently heard, too, of an eleven-year-old brother who was at home when a woman called there by mistake. After giving the stranger correct directions to her destination, the brother mentioned that it was good she came when she did as he was about to leave for his friend’s home to study the Bible with him. The woman wanted to know more. He was happy to explain and placed a <em>Truth </em>book with her so that she, too, might study.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Have you thought, too, of the effect that your appearance and conduct have on others when you call at their homes to witness to them? A few months ago a letter came to the office from a man in California who said, “This is to let you know how proud I was of the two young men that called at my door on Sunday . . . They were well schooled and very neat in their appearance.” How good it was that these young Christian ministers took the time to be sure that their appearance was befitting the message they were bearing! Can you imagine what his reaction might have been if these young brothers had come to the door looking and behaving like those among the youth of today who are rebellious?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Adult publishers are often glad to have you young ministers along with them in the field ministry. Sometimes people will not open their doors to a man alone or to two men, but will be inclined to open the door and listen when a younger publisher is along. Your parents, after teaching you a presentation that you can give, are delighted to stand beside you as you tell others of the hope within you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Another way you can accept Jesus’ invitation to draw closer to him is to take advantage of upbuilding others in the faith. For example, in the school you attend there may be other young brothers and sisters. Why not associate closely with them and talk to them about the things you are learning from God’s Word? In one school the brothers and sisters of various ages eat their lunch together and discuss the day’s text or the articles for youth that have appeared in <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span><em>The Watchtower. </em>Their noontime discussion periods have been a protection for them both physically and spiritually. Could you do this at your school?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>As you grow older, what will you do with your life? Are you planning to engage in the pioneer service when out of school? Have you thought of serving at Bethel or in the missionary service? You will experience great joy and have endless privileges if you prepare now for such full-time service and reach your goal in the future. Even if circumstances are such that you cannot pioneer, there is plenty to do in your congregation and you may work to qualify in time as a ministerial servant and, later, as an elder. We are glad that you have accepted Jesus’ invitation to “come,” and we encourage you to serve whole-souled.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>.</p>

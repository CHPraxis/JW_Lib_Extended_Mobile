How Did We Do in August?
Excellent! As a result of your zealous activity, a new peak in books placed was reached in August​—972,612 copies. That is the highest number of books that Jehovah’s people have ever placed in any one month.
Just think what that means as far as spreading the teaching of Jesus is concerned, as most of those books were likely “Learning from the Great Teacher.” We will want to encourage parents who have this fine teaching aid to use it regularly to teach their children the principles of truth and righteousness. It can be the means of protecting them against the moral decay of this system of things and guiding their minds and hearts in the doing of Jehovah’s will in the future, for their eternal welfare.

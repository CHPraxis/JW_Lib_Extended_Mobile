<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Although this may not seem possible in view of present circumstances, it is, nevertheless, a very real prospect.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A paradise is what our Creator purposed for this earth, and his purposes never fail to be carried out.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For your family to live in that paradise they need to follow a course that is in harmony with the One who makes it possible. This requires a knowledge and understanding of his written Word, the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You can be greatly aided in gaining such knowledge by obtaining one or all of the following Bible study aids: <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth,” You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World, What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </em>and <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth.” </em>You can obtain all of them for $2 and thereby build a fine Bible library.</p>

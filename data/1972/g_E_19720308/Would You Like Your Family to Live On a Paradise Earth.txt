Would You Like Your Family to Live On a Paradise Earth?
Although this may not seem possible in view of present circumstances, it is, nevertheless, a very real prospect.
A paradise is what our Creator purposed for this earth, and his purposes never fail to be carried out.
For your family to live in that paradise they need to follow a course that is in harmony with the One who makes it possible. This requires a knowledge and understanding of his written Word, the Bible.
You can be greatly aided in gaining such knowledge by obtaining one or all of the following Bible study aids: “New Heavens and a New Earth,” You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World, What Has Religion Done for Mankind? and “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” You can obtain all of them for $2 and thereby build a fine Bible library.
Please send me the following books (check which): □ “New Heavens and a New Earth,” □ You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World, □ What Has Religion Done for Mankind? and □ “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” Enclosed is $‐‐‐‐. (Send 50c per book for the ones that you want. You will also receive a gift booklet with each book you order.)

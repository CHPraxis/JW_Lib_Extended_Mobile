<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Once John the Baptist advised certain men in military service: “Do not harass anybody or <em>accuse anybody falsely.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:14-42:3:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 3:14</a>) In relating this account, Luke used a Greek expression that literally means “should you take by fig-showing.” What is a “fig-shower”?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Various authorities offer the explanation that in ancient Athens exporting figs out of the province was prohibited. One who denounced others, accusing them of attempting to export figs, was termed a “fig-shower.” The word came to designate a malignant informer, a person who accused others out of a love of gain, a false accuser, a blackmailer.</p>

<p><span class="font5">In Uncle Sam’s soil library at Washington are fifty thousand bottles which include every type of earth known to science. These have literally been collected from every corner of the earth, despite dangers from bandits, wild beasts, fevers and other terrors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Uncle Sam’s own domain he finds 4,053 different varieties of soil, about 1,000 of which are important in his food-producing economy. He is now making a great soil map, at a cost of ®ai^i;inillion dollars. Farmers have only to consult these maps to know which crops are most profitable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?■-i i • iai</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Uncle Sam has his own machine for soil analysis. With great rapidity it separates liquid from solid particles, and elements one from another. The machine discloses that the salts appearing in soils are more complex than hitherto supposed. A11 soil is good soil, having an overplus of something needed elsewhere. Man’s job is to assist in the transfer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Soil Analysis May Fool You</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19281128_files/g_E_19281128-3.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font5">OUR soil may analyze all right and yet it may be unproductive. Food may be on the table, but if it is not properly cooked and if your system can not assimilate it in the form in which it is offered to you, you may starve in the midst of plenty; and just so with a plant. Man’s job is to see that the right food gets to the plants in a form in which they can use it; and he has only begun to learn how to do it. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The soil is not only an inexhaustible storehouse, but it is a vast workshop or laboratory in which plant food is being constantly prepared for the use of plants. The object of tilling the soil is to promote the processes by which this is brought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In its soil maps the Department of Agriculture maps and classifies the soils on the basis' of their agricultural values. The physical and chemical examinations are used to support observations actually made in the field as to what the plants are doing in the soil itself. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some general observations are of value. Almost any plant will thrive in a soil composed of leaf mold, garden loam and clean, gritty sand. The leaf mold contains food instantly available to the plants. Well-rotted barnyard manure is a good substitute when leaf mold can not be had. The loam adds bulk. The sand prevents., caking and helps in the drainage. The sand should constitute about one-third of the volume of the mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loam is a broad term to describe soil which contains clay with a mixture of grass roots, and usually a little slowly available plant food, Loam can be made of decayed pasture or lawn sod. Dark-colored soils are usually wanner than light-colored ones. Wet soils are colder than dry ones. Soils exposed to the direct rays of the sun are warmer than those not having such a favorable exposure. A soil containing much sand and gravel is warmer than one containing much loam. Heat is an important factor in all life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">VERY trainload of food that goes east carries some of the fertility of the West along with it. New York harbor is filled with it to such a point that the salt water will barely neutralize it even now. New York would be better off if its riches ivere more evenly distributed; a,nd that applies to its under-water riches as well as its Wall Street ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When twenty-five bushels of wheat are cropped from an acre of land.,, there are removed from that acre 29.59 pounds of potash, 20.56 pounds of phosphoric acid and 500 pounds of nitrates, although, as will be shown hereafter, some of these nitrates do not come from the soil but from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are other mineral substances in. the wheat, besides these three. Wheat and other plants require sulphur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, aluminum, sodium, silicon and manganese, and so do the people that eat their fruits, but there is a limit of absorption of all of these by the human body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rain-water enriches the soil with nitrogen, and benefits it by washing away its toxins, but it does damage too by erosion. Nevertheless soil eroded in one place will eventually land somewhere else, and it is not impossible that soils thus carried afar may do more good in the end than if left where first manufactured in nature’s laboratory; frequently not, however, as they are often washed to places where there is already sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a certain amount of soil impoverishment caused by the unwise use of certain fertilizers which set some of the soil constituents free and throw them into the drainage water. Lime is constantly removed by leaching. Deep plowing, the plowing under of manure, stubble, stalks and cover crops, the practice of tile drainage and the use of explosives, all. help to render a soil, more permeable to water, and lessen file losses by erosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Present losses by erosion are estimated, at not less than $1.00*3,000 a year in the United States. Part of this loss is in fertile soil actually washed away, and part of it is in the creation of gullies which reduce the area for cultivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Foods for the Plants</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IRST of all foods, a plant must have water.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19281128_files/g_E_19281128-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">For each pound of solid matter that it draws from the soil, plant life must have 250 to 500 pounds of water. Not only is water an important constituent of plant tissue, but it is of the greatest importance as a solvent and carrier of food in the plant. The largest part passes out through the leaves by transpiration, which is essential to the healthy growth of the plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The value of animal excrements applied to soils on which crops are grown has been appreciated by the husbandman from the beginning. In China this is so clearly understood, and the people are so desperately poor, that boys watch for the droppings of horses and gather them immediately in baskets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Belgium the family treasure is its manure heap- or pit. A farmer rears his<sup>:</sup> family in comfort on three acres of land that has been cropped for two thousand years. Yet within two hours’ ride of New York city are many farms which have been abandoned because their fertility is. supposedly worked out. The American farmer has not properly valued or used the manure made on his place. He has wasted it. The Belgian saves it, solid and liquid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Denmark is a land of drifting sand, but because the Danish farmer has known how to collect and distribute the manure of his fam animals it has become one of the garden spots of the world, and is a land where poverty is virtually unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Farm manure increases crop production by improving the condition of the soil, as well as by furnishing plant nutrients. In each ton of manure there are 300 to 600 pounds of organic matter. Its rotting loosens and warms the soil, and it is in a very real sense the life of the soil, for it supplies a home and food for soil bacteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The use of well-rotted manure owes its popularity in part, to the fact that it supplies an enormous number of bacteria to the land at a time of year when fermentation in the soil itself is proceeding very slowly. The result is a msss infection or mass inoculation of greatest value to the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Billions of Tiny Soil Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Y</span><span class="font5">OU know what a saltspoon is like. It is the smallest kind of spoon most of us have ever seen or used. Well, the men with the microscopes tell us that a saltspoonful of earth contains from 600,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 workers that are devoting their lives to soil fertility. Hence man has untold billions of friends that he knows nothing about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certain kinds of bacteria capture carbon dioxide from the air, build it into their bodies, and when they die, release their organic substances as humus for the enrichment of the soil. Others capture nitrogen from the air, and the plants use that for meat-making materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the greatest services rendered by bacteria is the breaking down of dead plant and animal bodies. The process is not a simple one. One group of bacteria carries its work as far as its nature permits, and then another group takes it up until another stage has been reached. Were it not for these bacteria the earth would be uninhabitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are other important fertilizing agents in the earth itself, including earthworms and the roots of plants. Collectively these fix the free nitrogen of the air in the soil, or make the organic nitrogen available. They are active agents in the disintegration of rocks and the formation of soils. Good soil management is to so control moisture, aeration, temperatures, etc., that beneficial biological processes are promoted and the harmful restrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bacteria, live, but are not active, in frozen soils. They awaken to activity in the spring. The familiar signs of renewed life in the spring are largely the result of renewed activity on the part of these little workers. In the Orient no farmer would think of engaging in the farming business without a compost heap, a breeding ground for the bacteria without which farming can not be a success.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font5">AN is a land animal, gets his living from it, and is as much obligated to keep it in prime condition as any other animal: more so, in fact, for he is charged with supervising its affairs. The provision of Deuteronomy 23:12, 13 is a perfectly scientific solution of the sewage problem, the retention of a pure water supply, and the feeding of the soil:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is another item that is proper to mention here, because it has more to do with man’s physical welfare than any other one item. All human ailments have their start in the intestines. If these do their work properly the man is a well and happy man. The minute they stop working he is sick, unhappy and out of luck. Doctors thrive on sick intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The posture above indicated is essential for proper evacuation. The knees against the chest thrust the thighs in against the abdominal cavity, open the rectum, straighten out the sigmoid flexure, and with proper food, i. e., little or no white bread and little or no food cooked in aluminum, make evacuation natural, easy, voluminous and enjoyable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The French have a form of toilet, a hole in the floor, with places arranged for the feet to rest when in the evacuation posture, which is scientific; but, like all other “civilized” peoples they continue, as we do in America, to waste the valuable plant food locked up in human excreta. There will come a time when this senseless waste will be stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be added that the choosing of a different place every day in which to deposit manure is the secret of soil fertility. Liquid and solid manures which are put in a fresh place on a farm every day, and are dug in, in a short time make the soil literally alive with bacteria, and when seeds are planted in such soils they pop out and grow in almost no time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Commercial Fertilizers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the farm does not produce enough manure, or when it is thrown away and wasted, as is usually the case, commercial fertilizers are called upon. They were first, mentioned in a book dated 1660, but it was not until 1804 that any light was thrown upon the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the middle of the last century it was well</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">..................</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.understood that potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen are valuable constituents of fertilizers. Since then it has been shown that the Legumi-nosae (peas, beans, etc.) have the ability to secure much of their nitrogen from the air, and to leave a supply of nitrogen in organic matter in the soil when plowed under. Fertilization is futile unless the soil, contains humus, decayed vegetable matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the commercial fertilizer industry is little more than a half-century old, the annual sale of fertilizers is in excess of $325,000,000. Pennsylvania has a law prohibiting the sale in Pennsylvania of any mixed fertilizercontaining less than fourteen percent of total plant food, and it may not have less than one percent of ammonia, one percent of available phosphoric acid and one percent of water soluble potash. The so-called bacteriological fertilizers are mostly fakes, but sold to the gullible at as high as $1 a pound. Home mixed fertilizers are in every way far better for the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Odorless fertilizer is now produced, but the farmers do not take to it. They have a saying, but not a true one, that “all good fertilizer has a bad odor”, and hence in order to sell them the odorless article the makers were forced to odorize it good and loud to make it, acceptable. Such is life. Until it is “smelled up” the. so-called odorless fertilizer has an agreeable odor like the aroma from a newly opened can of cocoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Farm Journal</span><span class="font5"> tells us that nitrogen fails, to pay its way; that phosphorus increases the yield of wheat and oats, but falls down on corn and grass; that potash by itself is worse than nothing, but that when, the two losers, phosphoric acid and potash, are combined, they are builders and maintainers of the soil and compare quite favorably with manure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rhode Island State College announces that a fertilizer made of equal quantities of ammonium sulphate and nitrate of soda keeps the soil of a lawn in such condition that the grass develops while the weeds are so weakened that they die out. This discovery took twenty years of research. Arsenite of soda destroys weeds but possibly has a bad effect on the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Limestone as a Sweetener</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font5">ALESTINE is a limestone land, and God described it as “a land flowing with milk and honey”,. The famous black soils of India and Russia are derived, from limestone. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">extremely productive irrigated regions of the far West are invariably well supplied with Limestone. it is a welt-understood maxim, among farmers that a limestone country is a rich country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Limestone is soluble in carbonated water, and in hmmid areas needs to be replaced. It has the power of flocculating the soil particles and thus renders soils more porous. Soils containing large amounts of clay are greatly benefited by the addition of lime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lime corrects soil acidity, sweetening the soil so that favorable bacteria may develop and aid in the work of making plant food available for the growing crop. Lime will also combine with some of the plant food materials already in the soil to make them, more readily available, and it supplies calcium as a plant food. When limestone is burnt it loses two-fifths of its weight, but its efficiency for soil improvement is not changed at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">English chalk is limestone, and our forefathers formerly applied fifty to one hundred loads- of chalk, to the acre. and received great and lasting benefits -.from their work. In Cornwall sea sand, containing’ a large percentage of calcium carbonate derived from the shells of sea mollusks, is used successfully for the same purpose. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Phosphate Hoek Deposits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TUTANY volcanoes, perhaps all. of them, are </span><span class="font6">1VX </span><span class="font5">fertilizer factories, making phosphate of lime on a gigantic scale. For miles and miles around Mount Katmai, Alaska, which blew up in 1912, there is now a luxuriant growth . of grass in a region that was. barren, at the. time the explosion occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The phosphate .deposits, of Makatea, northeast of Tahiti, are over the top of an extinct volcano. The whole island is full of caves and hidden pitfalls. Unless a stranger follows the established pathway he is liable to fall Into some vegetation-hidden aperture, and io stay there until the resurrection. Not a nice place to live, ehlr&gt;i ■ ? <sub>: H</sub> ,■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>!</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The phosphate deposits of Nauru, which contain 1(.!0,000,000 tons of highest grade phosphates, were discovered by accident by a petty officer of a steamer calling regularly at the port, The control of this island passed from Germany to Britain at the end of the W orld .War and assures Britain. New Zealand and Australia all the phosphates they will need for many decades. . Until recently the phosphate deposits of Florida have been the preeminent source for the whole world. Now there are known deposits of great extent in Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and some in Spain, Tunis and Algeria. It is claimed that the Idaho phosphate resources run into billions of tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nitrogen and Nitrates</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Lord has made peas, beans and other plants so that they can get nitrogen out of the air. Whatever aids circulation* of the air in soil adds to its nitrogen. A light rain washes it in and a heavy rain washes it out. All nitrogen comes directly or indirectly from the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one time there were immense floating meadows of sea-grass off the coast of Chile. Volcanic upheavals isolated a part of the ocean between ranges of the Andes. In due time the sea water evaporated and the sea-grass and the bodies and bones of fish decomposed and ultimately formed the Chilean nitrate deposits about which we hear so much and which are so widely exploited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chilean nitrate deposits are at an elevation of 3,000 to 5,000 feet and extend for 260 miles along the coast. At the top is a layer of gypsum sand called ‘chuca’. Beneath it is a rocky conglomeration of ten or a dozen materials called ‘costra’. Next downward is another conglomeration in which there is a small quantity of nitrate. This is called ‘kongelo’. Beneath the ‘kongelo’ is found the ‘caliche’, the nitrate deposit proper. Beneath the ‘caliche’ is a layer of clay, ‘coba,’ which lies upon the primitive rock, and beneath which no more nitrate is found. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chilean nitrate deposits give work to nearly half a million persons and provide more than one-half the revenues of the government of Chile. Few things have? ever been more widely or successfully advertised. Shipments are now being made to twenty-eight countries. At the present rate of use they are expected to last about two hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germany makes her own nitrates out of the air and has givers, the Chilean nitrate industry a Sard battle in recent years. Because nitrate of soda acts quickly in inducing growth it is much favored by market gardeners. A light dressing on meadow land in early spring assists greatly in hastening growth by furnishing available nitrogen before the conditions are favorable for making available the more inert nitrogen of the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States has nitrate deposits near the town of Winkelman, Arizona, but its principal supply, and the principal supply of every country under the sun, is the air we breathe, four-fifths of which is nitrogen. Some of the plants used to bring it down to us are alfalfa, sweet clover, crimson clover, vetches, cow peas, velvet beans, peanuts, soy beans, pinto beans, tepary beans, kudzu grass and corn stalks. In all instances the nitrogen for the soil is obtained by plowing in the roots and waste parts of the plants. Every time a ton of corn stalks is burned $3 worth of nitrates goes up in smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nitrate of soda has a tendency to puddle the soil and prevent an open floccular structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Potash Industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE production of potash fertilizers is largely confined to Germany, where the Stassfurt deposits are 50 to 150 feet in thickness and considered to be inexhaustible. The mines are operated by a syndicate which maintains a uniform price on the output. During the World War there was a world-wide potash famine (and a nitrate famine too). &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Potash beds have been found in the deserts of ■ Texas and New Mexico, but are considered too. far from centers of consumption for development at this time. There are green sands in New Jersey that are full of potash, and one such deposit is being worked. There is also a large potash plant at Searles Lake, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is believed that America’s most likely source of potash is from the seaweed of the Pacific Coast, which often grows one hundred feet long. It also contains nitrates and phosphoric acid, ammonia and iodine. The proposition has been made to transplant this seaweed to the eastern shores of America, to dispose of harbor and sea pollutions and to provide valuable fertilizers. Such practices have been observed in Asia for centuries. The water hyacinth, which rapidly fills up certain streams, is a great gatherer of potash, and is valuable for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An acre of wheat uses up 100 pounds of potash, cabbage requires 270 pounds to the acre, sugar cane 100 pounds, tobacco 200 pounds, and rice twenty pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Other Plant Foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">ULPHUR fertilization is valuable for alfalfa, clover, beans and peas. It is used to cheek injury from the potato scab fungus, also the fungi that injure celery, sweet corn, field corn, etc. Every coke-oven distills ammonia that is a precious plant food for certain plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fertilization of air by inoculating it with, carbonic acid gas has produced such good results that it has even been proposed to operate plants with a view to utilizing their waste gases in this manner, but it sounds as if such a scheme would be hard on the gardeners and other folks in the vicinity. Under the influence of sunlight, plants draw in carbon dioxide and use this gas to manufacture the starch on which their growth depends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably by this time some of our farmer friends have heard more of the recharging of the soil undertaken last year on a farm near Rochester, N. Y., by Hamilton L. Roe, of Pittsburgh. According to Mr. Roe, land never wears out, but just runs down, as a storage battery does, and needs to he recharged. By using a plow which shoots 103,000 volts of electricity into the earth, Mr. Boe claims, the soil is so rejuvenated that fertilizers and crop rotation are unnecessary. We anticipate further reports on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sweden is getting good results by artificial warming of soils and air under glass by<sup>7</sup> means of electric current at 127 volts. By this means lettuce was placed on the market in March. This is not exactly fertilization, but is a related item.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few years ago we heard something of ra-diumizing the soil, and. great things were claimed for it. Possibly it is still in use. If so, we should appreciate clippings on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most hopeful, happy things that emerged from the horrors of the World War is the fact that the chemicals cooped up in the shells fired on French soil are gradually making their way out and are benefiting the soil. The shells gave French soil such a turning over as it never had before and have really nourished it, doubled its richness.</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19281128_files/g_E_19281128-6.png" alt="" style="width:20pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">brest J. Kleinhaks, an expert market gardener, a man with thirty-five years’ experience, tells us that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">under present conditions, </span><span class="font5">with all the blights, .storms and pests taking their toll of the crops, one-fifth of an acre will feed a man or woman 366 days. A square mile would feed 3,200 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The area of the world is 57,255,200 square miles, or 36,643,328,000 acres. If the entire area could be cropped this would provide food for 183,216,640,000 persons, or about nine times as many persons as have ever lived upon the earth. And that is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">under present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The idea that man will ever run out of food on this planet is folly. Not only will the earth yield its increase so as to produce far more food per acre than Mr. Kleinhans now produces, but men will return to the Medo-Persian habit of eating one meal a day, and will actually geit more benefit out of the one meal than they do now out of the three or four or five meals some people eat. In the British Isles it seems to a visitor as if the people were eating all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the chemists are already telling us that they think in a little while they will be able to get food out of the forests, out of the- sunshine and out of the air, and that there is in the ocean a simply inexhaustible supply of minute cellular life which will some time be part of human diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So let the mourners who are afraid there will be a resurrection and that everybody will go hungry cheer up. There will be food, for all. There is so much food now that it is necessary to destroy it by the train load so as to keep up the prices of the part that is sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What the people need more than food is faith in God, and a set of active bowels which means a healthy brain. Man was given a by the Almighty when he was told to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">subdue</span><span class="font5"> the earth, bring it under control. Just now he is merely groping for the levers of control. Up till now he has been, poisoned, stupefied, clogged and hampered by the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He has been a slave to politicians, wholesale food magnates, preachers, railroads, bad cooks, worse doctors, an abnormal, appetite, greedy undertakers and aluminum cooking utensils. But the sun is coming up and nothing can ever again push it behind the horizon. Cheer up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t worry about the deserts. They shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. Don’t worry about the ice-capped mountains. They make excellent scenery; and who wants the earth flat as a pancake? Don’t worry about the oceans. They are our reservoirs of rain, and they would come in handy if some fool should ever set the earth on fixe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t worry about the volcanoes. Volcanic dust has a profound effect in cooling overheated air and promoting rain, and volcanic ash is an excellent fertilizer. Don’t worry about ' the waterfalls, and crags, and chasms and cliffs and canyons. They are nice to look at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t worry because here in the East we have hundreds of square miles of rocky land. One of these times men will be running rock crushers overtime and sending soil from these rock piles to the places where it is needed. Stop listening to the world-burners, the hunger-squawkers and the helpless idiots in the pulpit and out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earth is all right. All we need is for the Lord to run things instead of the Devil, and we know that that happy time has begun. The very fact that we can face the future with a broad grin and that we heave a sigh of pity for the poor fellows who are in the casket-making and undertaking business shows of itself that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The Farmer’s Way to Affluence </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. H. Barton</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font5">VERY square inch of the earth’s surface has a column of air resting on it that weighs approximately fifteen pounds. That fifteen pounds is four-fifths nitrogen, and four-fifths of fifteen is twelve; therefore, there are twelve pounds of nitrogen over each square inch of land, waiting to be mined. Nitrogen is worth an average of about twenty cents per pound; therefore there is $2.40 worth of it over each square inch of land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now listen: An acre of land contains 6,272,640 square inches, which at $2.40 per square inch would make $15,054,336, the value of the nitrogen over one acre of land, waiting to be extracted by cooperating with nature in growing and turning legumes, such as vetch, crimson clover, etc. The supply is inexhaustible. You can’t remove it all; you couldn’t use it all if you had it; for plants are like animals: they can eat just so much, and no more, each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How can we mine this wealth? By sowing vetch in the fall and turning it in full bloom the next spring, you can easily get sixty pounds of nitrogen, which is equivalent to 400 pounds of nitrate of soda or 850 pounds of cottonseed meal; a value approximating $12, plus the value of the humus-making material plowed under, which, is easily worth as much more in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">soil ability</span><span class="font5"> per acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you thus treated as much as 100 acres each winter, your fertilizer benefit alone would be $1200 a year and $1200 more in soil ability, making a total increase of $2400 a year in soil fertility and soil ability, to say nothing about the 100 percent increase in the crops gathered for the first few years, at least, under this system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">B</span><span class="font5">UFFALO, -which once roamed the vast prairie land of the North American continent, •were rapidly becoming extinct until a few years ago when the Canadian government put forth an effort to conserve them, with astounding results. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> contains the following very interesting editorial* upon the matter: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The saving of the buffalo from extinction in Western Canada is a notable chapter in the history of wild life conservation. In 1900, so far as is known, there was not one specimen of this native western animal at large on the plains. A generation earlier they had been plentiful, but the advent of white settlers, with weapons more effective than the Indians had devised, wiped out the species completely. Today there is a herd of 5,000 buffalo at Wainwright park, while some 9,000 head roam freely near Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories. Beginning in 1925, the surplus animals produced at Wainwright were shipped north in large numbers. The wild herd thus created has flourished and multiplied beyond expectations. Western Canada’s most characteristic wild animal has been successfully brought back, due to a fortunate purchase of a small herd from a Montana plainsman by the Dominion government in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bison, says an article in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Natural Resources </span><span class="font4">(Ottawa), was once the outstanding big game animal in North America. Its huge bulk, its enormous battering-ram head, its splendid chest and shoulders covered with a magnificent shaggy coat of dark-brown hair, all combined to make it, in the words of a well-known naturalist, “the grandest ruminant that ever trod the earth.” Of all the large quadrupeds that have ever lived no species, it is said, has existed in such enormous numbers, and few have equaled it in value to man. To the Indians and early settlers of the western half of the continent the buffalo meant food, clothing and shelter. Its meat was as well flavored and as nutritious as the finest of beef; its thick robe furnished covering and clothing against the bitter winter cold; its hide was used for tepees and boats, while its horns, hair, hoofs and bones furnished many articles of use and adornment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time a certain number of those at Wainwright have been slaughtered, and a commercial disposition made of the meat, heads and robes. Experiments in cross-breeding buffalo, yak and domestic cattle are being carried .out at Buffalo Park, Wainwright, and some extremely interesting results have been secured, indicating that a new breed of animal containing a fair percentage of buffalo blood, and therefore of a hardier type than ordinary domestic cattle and capable of “rustling” for itself in the ■ winter xnon^s, may be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Hudson Bay Route</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Hudson’s Bay Company a short time ago announced that it would carry its supplies to posts in the far Northwest by use of the Hudson’s Bay route. Fort Churchill must therefore become an important center of the company’s business. North of the main line to the Hudson Bay, at the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary, a start has been made on the development of the Flin Flon mineral deposit, one of the richest on the North American continent. These are two results from the building of the Hudson’s Bay Bailway. Faultfinders of the project can no longer jeer at the road and argue that it will serve no purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> in a recent editorial said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that the completion of the road to salt water is certain and further argument against it useless and resistance futile, some of the newspapers of Eastern Canada that always treated with derision the whole idea of a Hudson Bay route to Europe begin to shift their ground somewhat. They are no longer quite so sure that the enterprise will be a fizzle. There have been admissions of late that the railway part of it will at least open, up a very extensive country, perhaps highly mineralized and in parts well timbered. One sees interviews much more frequent now with old “salts” who declare that Hudson Bay will be open, to navigation several months of the year—as many months, some of them say, as the port of Montreal is open to ocean vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a much more reasonable spirit abroad on this subject, and it is well that it is so, and our prediction is that in course of time it will be almost impossible to hear any one admitting that he was a disbeliever in opening up the Hudson Bay by railway and making of it a gateway to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is a good prophecy. The majority of those resisting the development of the Hudson Bay Railway will no doubt in a few years’ time be just as anxious to forget and conceal the opinions they had first formed as those who proclaimed that the C. P. R. enterprise was a foolish one. Montreal’s claim to a natural and inalienable right to control all of Canada’s export trade must be given up. The growth of commerce by the Pacific route has made Vancouver a rival of Quebec’s metropolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite Montreal’s opposition to the St. Lawrence deep waterway, this will eventually be constructed, making it possible for Atlantic steamers to have access to the Great Lakes, and making Toronto an ocean port. What is more</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">important, when the Hudson Bay Railway is ..completed, it will give Western Canada access to its nearest seacoast, and a port 750 miles from the center of agricultural production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Development of the line to the Hudson Bay, the Pacific route and the waterway, have all been strongly opposed by beneficiaries of the arrangement which kept the trade of Canada limited'to a very narrow groove. That a broader and more reasonable view on the general question of Canadian trade routes is beginning to prevail, is something to be much appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HERE were giants in Noah’s day that swallowed up the fruit of the labor of the peoples of earth. Jesus stated that as it was in Noah’s day so also it would be in our day. How truly His statement is being fulfilled, the following editorial appearing in one of the Western Canadian papers reveals: .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Financial Post</span><span class="font4"> carries some illuminating facts and figures bearing on the proposed merger of the Bank of Commerce and the Standard Bank. They show to what an extraordinary degree financial power is already concentrated in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the Commerce and the Standard unite there will be ten chartered banks left, which means that there are now eleven. But of these eleven the three largest own nearly three-quarters of the total bank assets of the country. On March 31 last the Royal Bank had assets of $924,770,962, the Bank of Montreal $896,182,587, and the Bank of Commerce $583,107,379. Union of the Standard with the Commerce- will bring the resources of the latter bank close to $700,000,000 and will make the total strength of the “big three” exceed two and a half billions of dollars—an amount greater than the Canadian national debt. The remaining six banks—the Nova Scotia, Dominion, Nationale, Imperial, Toronto, Provinciate and Weybum Security —have assets totalling $906,000,000. Most of these banks, as is well known, are pretty well confined to certain districts and can not be described as national.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Quoting the figures given, a writer in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Financial Post</span><span class="font4"> says there is speculation about future possible bank mergers. One that is talked of is a union of the Nova Scotia, Toronto, Dominion, and Imperial—a merger which would produce a bank with close to half a billion in assets. An amalgamation of the two French banks—the Nationale and Provinciale—is also talked of. These mergers would leave the banking business in the hands of five gigantic banks with headquarters in two cities, Montreal and Toronto. This is ..a prospect which the country can not contemplate with satisfaction. Competition in banking is already restricted to such an extent as to limit credit facilities unduly, especially in the newer parts of Canada. A clear statement of the government’s position on thi* question is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later the same paper editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These four main banks have bought twenty smaller ones since 1900, and most of the more important amalgamations have occurred in the last ten years. The country is headed straight for a position in which control of credit and banking facilities will be in the hands of three or four powerful institutions and a smaller group of men than the cabinet of Canada. There is a demand, voiced by the more radical members of the House of Commons, for stricter control of banking operations by the government., and even for nationalization of banking. J. S. Woodsworth, Labor member for Centre Winnipeg, at the last session in Ottawa, moved a resolution calling for “the establishment of a national system of banking”. This proposal found little support in the House, and, of course, none at all from the bankers who testified before the banking committee. A union of the Commerea and Standard banks will strengthen, the hand of those who seek radical change of the system. And if the merging process goes any further, the demand will bo, come irresistible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Increasing Automobile Accidents</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HAT automobile accidents are taking a larg» toll in human lives in Canada, as elsewhere, is only too true. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> of Saskatoon states in that regard:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of deaths in automobile accidents in Canada showed an alarming increase last year, according to information just made public at Ottawa. In 1926 there were 606 deaths directly attributable to the motor car. In 1927 there were 864, an increase of nearly fifty percent. It is certain that there was no such gain in the number of motor cars, or in the number of pedestrians. What the figures show, therefore, is increasing carelessness on the part of drivers despite safety first campaigns, stricter traffic laws, highway improvement and added safeguards at grade crossings. One would suppose, considering these and other measures to minimize risks and discourage recklessness, that the highways might become safer. The contrary is true. They are becoming more dan-, gerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canada, as a whole, has a lower death rate from motor accidents than the United States, and the western provinces of the Dominion have a better record than the rest of the country. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement. Of the 864 deaths caused last year by motor cars, probably more than 800 could have been prevented by the exercise of ordinary care and by obedience to the law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Senator from New York, former Commissioner of Health, New York city, when asked the question, “Is aluminum cooking ware injurious to the health?” made reply: “Food should not be allowed to remain overnight or for any period of time in such a vessel.” This question and reply have been published widely by the Newspapers Feature. Service, Inc., and confirms numerous articles on the subject which have been published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and attracted widespread attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum in the Blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E ARE requested to announce that “Dr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Frank C. Gephart, Ph.D., of 23 East 31st Street, New York city, ‘who analyzed six samples of blood taken from human beings (three,, Talladega, Ala.; three, South Carolina State®. Hospital), all of whom had received unknown and variable amounts of aluminum in baking powder food, found one to four parts per million in five out of the six samples.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are also requested to announce that Dr. Gephart “states that the article appearing in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> regarding him as being one of the leading chemists of the United States, who has found by experimentation that aluminum is poisonous, is erroneous, that it is not a statement of. fact according to his opinion, on the subject and he respectfully requests that you correct that statement in an early issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> He states that he never offered that opinion and does not believe same to be truer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are thus led to understand that Dr. Gephart, whose testimony before the Federal Trade Commission is summed up in the first paragraph above, believes that aluminum is one of the foreign substances that can float around in a man’s blood without doing him any harm; but we are still in the dark as to how many such foreign substances, and what quantities of them, could thus be carried to heart and brain and everywhere else over the body without making it necessary to ring up the undertaker. We hope Doctor Gephart is not being frightened by the aluminum trust. If he is scared, what chance is there for Doctor Betts or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Agel</span><span class="font5"> Pass the smelling salts, please, but not m an aluminum container.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Should Have Started Sooner</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TpnwiN Whibley, writes us from England, saying, “I must congratulate you upon the splendid work you are doing in helping to educate the public upon the dangers to health of aluminum and its compounds and to wish you success in your pioneer efforts. Where you now-lead, others must follow. The subject is too vital to be long ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As one who has been severely poisoned with almost fatal results and is now a complete ■ physical wreck, consequent upon the use of aluminum cooking ware, I can appreciate the good work you are doing in the public interest, and sincerely trust it will receive due public recognition.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Portland Versus Tacoma</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5"> SUBSCRIBER in The Dallas, Oregon, calls our attention to the fact that the leading paper of Portland has been singing for the Power Trust the little old, threadbare, silly song that whenever business is run by the public it is always poor service and costs the people more money. The people have been fed on that lie until it is coming out of their noses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our subscriber wants to know, if that is true, why it is that the privately-owned electric companies of The Dalles and Portland charge eleven and seven cents, respectively, per kilowatt hour for electric current, while in the publicly-owned plant at Tacoma the charge is three-fourths of a cent and if Tacoma is such a bad place why it is that a two-million-dollar manufacturing plant dodged both The Dalles and Portland and preferred Tacoma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not likely that our subscriber will get his question answered. The most we can say is that the regular orthodox system, of the private-ly-owmed electric plant would be to meet the Tacoma price for the manufacturing plant’s current, 'with full expectation of making up for it many times over by charging the citizens ten times the cost of current production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just why it is to the disadvantage of the common people to have their electric current supplied at a reasonable price never has been explained and never can be explained except by a skilled and. experienced staff of paid liars who know what is expected of them and never hesitate to deliver the goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Wireless Interference in Great Britain</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font5">LENTY of our readers are aware that there is nothing too mean nor too small for the British &quot;beast” to. do to prevent the circulation of truth regarding itself. They will not he surprised therefore to learn that when Judge Butherford made his great address at Detroit, on Sunday, August 5, 1928, the British broadcasting authorities either permitted somebody io deliberately fill the air with confusing and meaningless signals or else they planned it and 'did it themselves. A report on the matter from one of our British subscribers follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Sir: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am very sorry at the delay of this report re the &quot;Judge’s address from Detroit. The reason is, I have been working out of town and I have not had the chance to explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As I told you in my last letter that I intended building a set that would get the States, I had that set working and can guarantee to get the station which was sending out the lecture, namely, WGY short wave, any evening after eleven o ’clock; further, KDKA, Pittsburgh. Now the Saturday night previous to the broadcast, on Sunday I received the station previously mentioned and can transfer from the two-valve low-wave and get on at the four-valve amplifier. Now as to the address, I tuned in on WGY loty-wve and found a high-speed Morse station heterodyning on 31 meters; and I may say on authority, of a friend who is a member of the Chicago Wireless Society and in the wireless trade, that what was happening at the station was, a Morse key was set in motion and was simply sending nothing. It was a British station; and to he quite candid, done for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now I know that I was set right for the wave length, as about five minutes before the finish my friend and one of the brothers of the Leicester class distinctly heard a few words of our president and then the interference. I tuned in again on Sunday night on WGY and KDKA and the program was quite clear on phones at seven yards from the table. I know I have the set now that will receive IL S. A.; as a matter of fact, coupled up to the four-valve it will work the speaker as well as 5 XX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have any further addresses coming over I should be pleased to try for reception and also to hear from you if any one in this country did receive from Detroit. I may say that if ever we do get a chance to pull the station in, and know beforehand, our house will be full of eager seekers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Trusting to receive your reply, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours truly,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Recollections of Slave Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">S A young girl I lived.in Missouri during slave days and visited at seven.or eight different plantations. I never saw any slaves eating out of troughs, though certainly it may have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one plantation where we (Father, Mother and I) visited, we chanced to be there for a wedding. A pretty yellow girl belonging to Mrs. B. was married to a dark-colored man belonging to another plantation; the bride was dressed in a nice ’white dress and had some of her mistress’s jewelry on; the wedding supper was served in a cabin in the quarters. All us white folks were at the table first, of course; after us the bridal couple and their folks. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I remember well of iced cakes, goblets of candy, nuts and raisins, that being the manner then of serving candy. As J recollect, there was chicken and other good things. I recall that I put </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">large piece A cake with white icing in my pocket. On our return to the big house, I pinched a piece of cake to taste, and, behold, it was com bread covered with white icing!

<p><span class="font5">After the slaves were freed, Mother and I and the owner of this one-time slave, visited at her home. Mrs. R., the one-time owner, thought a great deal of this woman, so we went to her home one day and stayed for dinner. As before, we white folks were at the table first and-our hostess wmited on us; her young children waited, but one son, a man about twenty-five, I should judge as I now recall, came and sat down at dinner with us. Nothing was said then, but after her son went out. his mother apologized for his bad manners. lie had just come back from Washington and had different ideas than his mother. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One more and I’ll stop: At another plantation where we-*often visited I remember that each colored family had their own cabin and (lid their own cooking. I often went to one particular cabin to eat hoe-cake, mad* of cornmeal, baked into a large cake on a griddle. No troughs at these places.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Some Thoughts and Questions on Epidemics</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N THE 200 experiments calculated to prove the germ transmission theory, they could not develop a symptom of “flu”, diphtheria, or pneumonia. Dr. Thomas Powell, known to the medical world as the “germ-eater”, was abrased and swabbed, punctured, and fed all of the vilest and most vicious germs and cultures, by his medical friends, and the records show that no symptom of disease followed. Dr. J. B. Fraser, a germ theorist, the renowned Canadian experimenter, reports that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no symptom</span><span class="font5"> of pneumonia, “flu,” or diphtheria, could be transmitted in 670 tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">M. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J.</span><span class="font5"> Rodermund, M. D., Madison, Wis., exploded the germ-transmission theory when, in 1901, he smeared his hands, face, and clothing with the vile pus from a small-pox patient in a pest-house, and, dodging the police and health authorities, traveled hundreds of miles through Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana without washing, exposing thousands of people on trains and in various cities. Not a case of small-pox was found in the wake of his journey despite the frenzied effort of police and ill-health departments everywhere. Dr. Rodermund posted his challenge with $2,000 that the medical world can not show germ transmission or a contagious disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Smile, but don’t laugh. Humor sees through hypocrisy, pierces pomp and pretension, hoots down fads and fallacies imposed upon the less observing portion of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Some things are supposed to be that ain’t” —pneumonia ain’t a germ disease, ain’t contagious, ain’t to be controlled by quarantine, and most cases of congestion with fever, reported as pneumonia, ain’t pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believe in the germ, and believe that conta» gions are rampant in our land if you want to. Believe, and support this pretense just as long as you will, great peoples of the greatest country on earth. It is easier to believe than to investigate. It is easier tcustudy politics than to study health. That is why political pathologists are on our health departments. Belief did not keep the earth flat, and belief did not help the kaiser to whip the world, neither will the belief feed and keep the germ and contagion alive. It has kept health departments alive for many years, but, depending upon the general belief in germs, the day is not far distant when the joke</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. B. H. Jones</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and the hoax will be turned upon the connivers, as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “regular” howl, “¥ou should see your doctor, at once,” has “buffaloed” almost all families into the belief that it is dangerous to do any common sense thing for relief in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">F. W. Newman tells us, “Against the body of a healthy man Parliament has no right of assault whatever under pretense of public health; nor any the more against the body of a healthy infant. To forbid perfect health is tyrannical wickedness, just as much as to forbid chastity or sobriety. No law-giver can have the right. The [vaccination] law is an unendurable usurpation and creates the right of resistance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Mr. Newman says of the British Parliament applies everywhere. No body of men, anywhere, has the right to commit an assault against the body of any human being, under any pretext whatsoever. Any such law creates the right of and incentive for resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Home Educator</span><span class="font5"> tells us: “Compulsory vaccination does not exist in all of the United States. There is no penalty for neglecting vaccination in Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Alabama, Vermont, and Hlinois. There is exemption on account of conscientious objection to vaccination in California.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why does small-pox occur in those who were vaccinated two weeks before? Why a law that, upon its face, is a farce?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why does vaccination take on the second, third, fourth or seventh inoculation, and not on the first? Why are alleys, back yards, sink pipes, drains and sewers allowed to settle in filth while every attention is given to epidemics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If sewage were coming in your water pipe would you expect to purify it at the faucet? If a thing is true at all, there is a reason for it, and an explanation of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do the quarantine officers possess or usurp the right to raise quarantine for one and compel all others to obey it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are we subject to whim, caprice, and special privilege, without recourse to reason and intelligent research?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are the American Medical Association and its boards of health everywhere too sacred or too big for conscientious investigation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are the people of this big world sleeping while the “poli” build a wall of supposed laws, from where the whole herd or flock are to be led</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to vaccination, vivisection, antitoxins and ser-umizings ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What though the vaccine and serum makers —the biologists—have an enviable reputation for “scientific, cleanly productions”? Is it proof or evidence of its being a healthy product to inject into a healthy man or child, or what it is made of ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this world where every enterprise is ostensibly for human good and achievement, are we being held in the most debasing slavery merely upon statements of opinions handed down through channels of great wealth or great organizations, who seek to obstruct anything that savors of an investigation that would lead to discoveries of scandal in the so-called health sciences, greater than all others combined?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Twill make but little difference to you and me, for life is but a “wee span”, but it will make a vast difference to the next two generations. State medicine has been declared by the powers that be in medical circles, and for years they have sought to place a secretary in the President’s cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A bunch of “lame ducks”—called law-makers •—have nearly, if not quite, handed the extreme of special privilege to the supposed science of epidemic research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may well lay aside all opposition to color, race and creed, to fight this octopus.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark28"></a>In Direct Touch With the Devils</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HERE are plenty of places in the Western World where white men can and do come in contact with the Devil and with the Devil’s organization; but read the following from the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font5"> and see the lengths to which the demons can and do go in places in the heart of Central Africa, where they are direct-' ly worshiped. While the writer gives credit to certain leaves, yet it is certain that the leaves are merely a mask. No herbs could ever produce such results as would make exhibitions like this possible without direct and powerful demoniacal aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A savage mchawi-moto or fire-magician who baked his own head in a hole filled with red-hot stones was one of a party of Wakimbu fire-dancers who came to the writer’s camp in Tanganyika not long back offering to give a show in return for some eland meat which we had shot. A huge pile of brushwood was set ablaze and while it roared itself into a veritable inferno the Wakimbu departed to a nearby forest in search of dawa or magic-medicine. They came back with handfuls of leaves which they chewed to mash and then smeared like slimy green ointment over their naked bodies; then yelling like so many devils, they leaped into the licking flames, sending up great clouds of sparks, through which they could be seen flinging their flame-wrapped limbs in the wild contortions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">demoniac dance. Three grinning younger black lads squatted on their haunches round the fire, beating thunder from snake-skin topped ngomas or hollowed tree-trunk drums, while a fourth leaped round like a fiery satyr blowing a piercing jeering wail from a five-noted ulele or native piccolo. Out of the red-black chasms of the smoke and flame one of the . dancers would hurtle himself every now and then, brandishing a blazing brand, rub himself vigorously all over with it, bite the red-hot char from, it, chew it, spit it out and then leap back again with a yell into the furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within ten minutes the fire was nearly trampled out and the star-turn of the Wakimbu fire-magic was staged by the dancers’ digging a hole big enough for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">man to thurst his head and shoulders in, filling it with stone and piling the embers of the fire upon it with their hands. A wait of some minutes, enlivened by the chief magician’s running his hunting-knife backward and forward through the muscles of his arm without drawing the merest speck of blood, and the embers were kicked off, revealing the stones red-hot in the pit. Throwing himself on the ground the chief magician thrust in his head while his companions piled up earth and char until his head and shoulders were completely buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So he baked as the writer timed him for 27 minutes; suddenly his body collapsed and fearing the worst we dashed to him, dragged him out by the heels, as we thought, dead. We tried every camp restorative we had; the man lay inert; no pulse;no breath. Then suddenly he leaped up yelling like a fiend and broke into a wild dance with his friends shrieking with laughter at our very evident alarm. Half an hour later this band of fire-magicians enrolled as porters to carry the writer’s baggage twenty miles to the next camp, and not one of them showed a blister; the frizzly hair on their bullet heads was not even singed. How is it done? By the magic dawa of the forest, they say: but they will not divulge what leaves the dawa is made of: that is the Wakimbu’s secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Order, Heaven’s First Law </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By C. W. Blane, (Ireland)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Apostle Paid says, &quot;God Is not the author of confusion, but of peace<sup>5</sup>' (1 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.14: 33); or in other words, God is a god of order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we look toward the heavens and there behold the sun, moon and stars ceaselessly and noiselessly performing their respective functions in such an orderly manner, not a fraction of a moment too soon or too late, day after day, year after year, they manifest not only order but also a wonderfully organized arrangement as expressed by the Prophet David: “The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.<sup>5</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then again we have his division of the seasons into seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night, which we are informed shall not cease while the earth remaineth. (Gen. 8:22) And thus as we follow God’s course through Bible history we can not but notice the orderly manner of all his arrangements, even to the minutest details. The apostle calls attention to this respecting God’s instructions to Moses regarding the building of the tabernacle. “See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.”—Heb. 8: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should also be observed that obedience brings resultant blessings; while disobedience is followed by punishment, even as in the case of our first parents. For God is not only a God of order but also a God of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us now look at a few individual cases. We have the case of Abraham and his great reward for his faith in and obedience to God. On the other hand we have the case of Miriam and Aaron who spoke against Moses because he married an Ethiopian woman. The record (Numbers 12) discloses that they considered Moses to be taking too much upon himself, which was really none of their concern, and they said, “Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us!” And the Lord heard it with results disastrous to these murmurers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have another instance in the case of Saul, who was chosen by God as Israel’s king; but Saul, not content to perform the sole duties of his position, took upon himself to interfere with the Lord’s arrangement respecting Samuel’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">149 </span><span class="font5">duties also and with equally disastrous results to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another almost similar case is that of King Uzziah who remained faithful for a time but who, like Saul, interfered with the Lord’s arrangements and as a result was stricken with leprosy and died. So then we sec that where Jehovah makes choice (for the psalmist says, “God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.”—Ps. 75:7), it is for those who seek to please Him to recognize His choice and cooperate with such, to the end that God may be glorified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There appears to be a strong delusion among Bible Students to the effect that Isaiah 52:8 merely refers to a unity of vision on what they call “fundamentals”. The passage does not speak of or imply any such unity, but clearly shows that at a certain time the Lord’s people shall know His name and that He doth speak. Then it states: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him [a class] that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth sal* vation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reign-eth!” And then follows verse 8, “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice [message]; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly this prophecy plainly shows that at a certain time these things will be fulfilled. The channel (the Watch Tower B. &amp;&nbsp;T. Society) which has for over fifty years been used by the Lord for this purpose has clearly shown that the time for the setting up of Zion would be 1914; and all Bible Students whose desire is to be faithful to Jefiovah clearly see the significance of the announcement of the prophet in harmony with the declaration:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) My people shall know my name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) The message is Jehovah’s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) It will be communicated to Zion that “Thy God reigneth”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Is not this true and only true since the due time for our Lord to take unto Him His power to reign and the subsequent coming to His temple, suddenly, for judgment? (Mah 3:1) Then follows the passage about seeing eye to eye. It is clear to the writer’s mind that the idea of this unity on “fundamentals”, coupled with the claim of faithfulness to Jehovah, is one of the strong delusions of the enemy’s, the subtlety of which is not'dearly seen and is apparently deceiving many through failure to exercise their own faculties instead of leaning </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font5"> others. It is surely unreasonable io think that one can be faithful to the Lord while at the sapie time ignoring or rejecting his organization for carrying nut 3Lis work. It is a case of obedience or of disobedience, otherwise termed lawlessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is remarkable, too, that the Apostle Paul, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5"> Thessalonians 2, states that this delusion will manifest itself in the believing a lie because not receiving the truth for the love of it; and evidently the same thought runs through Matthew’s statement, in chapter 24, on deceiving of the very elect, because he says we are not to believe certain things about Christ’s being here or there, knowing that He can not be seen with the natural eye. Again, how significant are the words of the Lord in John 8: 31, 32. “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, in the first place, no one could be in the Lord’s family unless one believed in the so-called “fundamentals”; and secondly, such belief does not necessarily give any one the standing of this Zion class which is due and only due to faithfulness and obedience to Jehovah in the same manner and along the same lines as our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little reflection upon the attitude of ignoring or rejecting the Lord’s organization may prove helpful to some. Remembering that those placed in the different positions of the Society have been chosen in accordance' with the instructions laid down by the apostles, i. e., by vote of the ecclesias; and that being so, and recognizing Jehovah as a God of order, how can any of the Lord’s people think that they are faithful to Him while at the same time they reject the counsel of those placed by Him in position for carrying out the work? This, to the writer’s mind, is on a par with the attitude adopted by Miriam and Aaron, Saul and Uz-ziah, who doubtless claimed to serve Jehovah equally as sincerely as Moses, Samuel or Isaiah, if not more so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any suggestions coming from headquarters, we may rest assured (provided we have the mind to esteem others as better than ourselves), are those which have already been tested and found to be the most effective for the carrying out of the work to be done at this time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">HEN I was in the legislature we dug up 849 janitors on the pay roll at the State House alone. They fired 800 of them in one forenoon. We never did look nice and clean around there until we fired those janitors. The rest of them got busy. You could see your face in my spittoon. Forty-nine janitors is enough for any state house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago they appointed twenty-three game wardens for Chicago—to keep the jack rabbits off of Jackson Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a certain city I once found ten doorkeepers assigned to one door. They were ashamed to appear on the job all at once, so they hired a negro to attend the door and then had the nerve to charge his pay up as expenses, so the taxpayers paid that also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some 700 people employed on the Chicago Sanitary District payroll were dismissed recently. They did not have one solitary thing to do. I am informed they had 2000 all told of the same kind. Forty percent of the taxes paid in Chicago is wasted. There are thousands of men on the payrolls eating up our tax money and they will not even let the public see the payrolls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time ago I told a Boston audience about twenty-three game wardens in Chicago and they were shocked. One wanted to know why I lived in such a State as Illinois. Then a nice-looking man arose and said they need not be surprised at the wickedness of Illinois. He said he was the man who dug up 115 bicycle inspectors in Boston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They foreclosed 123,000 farms in America because they could not pay their taxes during the year 1926. Fourteen counties in Minnesota are practically bankrupt and hundreds of thousands of acres of land have been sold for taxes. Meanwhile any number of millionaires do not pay any taxes at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Chicago daily sold for $15,000,000. It was all personal property. It returned as personal property in their possession $904,295, leaving as corporate excess, or, as the tax books call it, capital stock worth $14,095,705 which was not assessed at all. Yet this Chicago daily is one of the best assessed corporations in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Governor Lowden could not fill his engagement before the Illinois Real Estate Dealers’ convention held in Rockford, and they asked me to take his place on the program. I made the statement that one of the packing companies in Chicago had $14,000,000 of a certain kind of property and defied them to show it was assessed a cent. It was assessable property, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1900 a large Chicago mail order company was on the tax books for $9,255,000 full valuation. In 1910 they did not file a schedule, so the assessors assessed them very kindly at a full valuation of $2,000,000 and punished them with a penalty of $1,000,000 more. Do you suppose they were worth less in 1910 than they were in 1900?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1919 they had a franchise worth $51,000,000; cash on hand,. $29,000,000; sold that year merchandise, $76,000,000; net profits, $6,390,181.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1926 I found them on the tax books at a total personal property assessment of $2,250,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were a lawyer I would undertake to prove that they get it down to where a lot of people who pay no taxes at all actually get a rebate. We pay $1,500,000,000 in interest now (and it all comes from taxes) to people who do not have to pay any taxes at all.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Crime and Criminals</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N AN address which Clarence S. Darrow gave in the Chicago County Jail he said some things that contain food for thought for those who are willing to do such an un-American thing as to use their own brains. It is a wonder that they allowed him to say such things, because they contain so much truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the first place, there are a good many more people who go to jail in the winter time than in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">nsi</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why is this? Is it because people are more wicked in winter? No, it is because the coal trust begins to get in its grip in the winter. A few gentlemen take possession of the coal, and unless the people will pay $7 or $8 a ton for something that is worth $3, they will have to freeze. Then there is nothing to do but to break into jail, and so there are many more in jail in the winter than in summer. It costs more for gas in the winter because the nights are longer, and peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pie go to jail to save gas bills. The jails are electric lighted. You may not know it, but these economic laws are working all the time, whether we know it or do not know it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are more people going to jail in hard times than in good times—few people comparatively go to jail except when they are'hard up. They go to jail because they have no other place to go. They may not know why, but it is true all the same. People are not more wicked in hard times. That is not the reason. The fact is true all over the world that in hard times more people go to jail than in good times, and in winter more people go to jail than in summer. Of course it is pretty hard times for people who go to jail at any time. The people who go to jail are almost always poor people—-people who have no other place to live first and last. When times are hard then you find large numbers of people who go to jail who would not otherwise be in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Long ago Mr. Buckle, who was a great philosopher and historian, collected facts and he showed that the number of people who are arrested increased just as the price of food increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am not talking pure theory. I will just give you two or three illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The English people once punished criminals by sending them away. They would load them on a ship and export them to Australia. England was owned by lords and nobles and rich people. They owned the whole earth over there, and the other people had to stay in the streets. They could not get a decent living. They used to take their criminals and send them to Australia—I mean the class of criminals who got caught. When these criminals got over there,. and nobody else had come, they had the whole continent to run over, and so they could raise sheep and furnish their own meat, which is easier than stealing it; these criminals then became decent, respectable people because they had a chance to live. They did not commit any crimes. They were just like the English people,-who sent them there, only better. And in the second generation the descendants of those criminals were as good and respectable a class of people as there were on the face of the earth, and then they began building churches and jails themselves. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So long as big criminals can get the coal fields, so long as the big criminals have control of the city council and get the public streets for street cars and gas rights, this is bound to send thousands of pool* people to jail. So long as men are allowed to monopolize all the earth, and compel others to live on such terms as these men see fit to make, then you are bound to get into jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only way in the world to abolish crime and criminals is to abolish the big ones and the little ones together. Make fair conditions of life. Give men a chance to live.' Abolish the right of private ownership of land, abolish monopoly, make the world partners in production, partners in the good things of life. Nobody would steal if he could get something of ..his own some easier way. Nobody will commit burglary when he has a house full.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Seed of the Covenant</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">[Broadcast, from Station WBBR,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font5">URSUING the further examination of the truth concerning the reconciliation of man to God, we will endeavor to look at the Scriptural proof relative to the seed of the covenant. As used in the Scriptures, the word “seed” means posterity, descendants, issue or offspring. Bear in mind, then, that the seed is the seed of the covenant and it is the covenant that produces the offspring tlirough which the blessings must come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was to Abraham that God made the promise to the effect: “In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.” We have the plain statement of the apostle that God used Abraham and his wife to make a picture. In this picture Abraham represented Jehovah God. His wife Sarah represented the covenant, and their son represented the seed of the covenant. On this point the Bible reads: “For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the bondwoman was horn after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai, which gen-dereth to bondage, which is Agar. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.”—Gal. 4:22-24, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is manifest that the seed must be produced before the blessing could come, because the seed is the channel of blessing. In the outworking of God’s great plan, then, we should first look to the development of the seed and thereafter to the blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been many centuries since God made the promise that He would bless all the families of the earth through the seed of Abraham. Because of this long period of time many have lost sight of the promise and give no heed whatsoever thereto. Many who claim to preach the gospel absolutely ignore this promise because it has been so long since made. God always keeps His promises. The time that seems long to man is not long to Jehovah. The apostle says that one day with God is equal to a thousand years of man’s way of calculating time. Measuring then from God’s viewpoint it has not been five days since Efe made the promise to bless all the families of the earth through “the seed”. We may be absolutely sure that God will fulfil that promise, and that within another day ililh v ■' ■ &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;153</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">with Him. It therefore becomes of great importance to determine who is “the seed” and how any one is made a part of that seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The Seed”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">NE does not need to be a natural descendant of Abraham in order to be of the promised “seed”. John the Baptist said to the Pharisees: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font5"> say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.” (Matt. -3:9) Addressing Zaccheus, a publican and a sinner, Jesus said: “This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.” (Luke 19: 9) These scriptures show that much more is required than lineal descent to be rated as an offspring of Abraham, within the meaning of the promise. Faith like unto Abraham’s is the test. “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.”—-Gal. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that Jesus received His human body through the granddaughter of Abraham, but surely that did not constitute Hint “the seed” of promise. It can not be said that He was the “seed” of promise before His consecration at the Jordan. At the time of His consecration Jesus was begotten by His Father to the divine nature and thereby He became the ‘seed of Abraham, according to the promise’. It was necessary for Jesus to be a lineal descendant of the patriarch Abraham because God said He should be. But it was not His human descent, but His course of action in obedience to God’s will, that made Him the “seed” that the covenant must produce. The Prophet Isaiah, speaking as for Jesus, said: “Behold, I and the children which God hath given me.” These were all partakers of flesh and blood. So likewise Jesus also partook of flesh and blood. (Heb. 2:13,14) Not many of the lineal descendants of Abraham are of the “seed” or will be of the “seed”, but all who constitute the “seed” are partakers of flesh and blood, including Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the time came to select the children of God, members of His body, Jesus did not lay hold upon angels, but He took hold upon th« “seed” of Abraham. (Heb. 2:16) By that we understand that He selected those who have the faith like unto Abraham’s. Those -who become God’s children through Christ are heirs of the promise and “seed” according to the promise.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Human relationship does not have any determining influence in the selection of the “seed” of Abraham according to the promise. It is therefore clear that Christ is the “seed” of promise and that all who come unto Christ partake of the “seed” by virtue of^the fact that they are in Christ and these are spiritual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been said that Jesus kept the law and that by keeping it He was qualified to be the “seed” of promise. That could not be true. Jesus was not a son of Hagar, who Paul says represented the law covenant. The Abrahamic covenant produces the “seed”, which is The Christ, and this must be done regardless of the law covenant. (Gal. 3:17) While it is true that Jesus kept the law, by so doing He did not gain anything. He magnified the law and showed it was righteous and perfect. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blessings for All</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE ultimate purpose of the Abrahamic covenant is to &quot;bless all the families of the earth’. The blessing must proceed from God; therefore God stated to Abraham: &quot;Tn thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Abraham was there in a representative capacity, and in the picture he represented God. It is God who does the blessing. The covenant must first produce the “seed”, which is Christ, and through Christ God administers the blessings. Therefore Isaac, the only son of Abraham and Sarah, represented Christ. In what will the blessing consist? Surely in the reconciliation of man to God. All reconciled and at peace with God will.have the right to live. The first ones to receive the blessings promised by the Abrahamic covenant are those who are justified by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ. That would mean, of course, those natural descendants of Abraham who accepted Jesus as The Christ and who were justified and begotten of the holy spirit at Pentecost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul says: &quot;&quot;And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.” (Gal. 3:8) The word “heathen” here means foreign, non-Jews, therefore Gentiles. This shows that justification by faith is a prominent feature and therefore the first part of the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant. The peoples and nations during the reign of Christ will not be justified by faith. Their justification will come at the end of His reign by full obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who, then, are the &quot;&quot;heathen” mentioned by the apostle in the above text? Surely those who are non-Jews, that is to say, Gentiles. The Jews received the first blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, and this is the plain statement of the Scriptures. &quot;&quot;Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away everv one of you from his iniquities.” —Acts 3: 25, 26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Paul tells who are the &quot;&quot;heathen”, saying, ‘&quot;That the blessing of Abraham might, come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith.” (Gal. 3:14) Strictly speaking, then, the &quot;&quot;seed” is the essential One, to wit, Christ Jesus, from whom the blessings must come to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are justified by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus are reconciled to God and therefore receive first the blessings promised by the Abrahamic covenant. When they are begotten of the holy spirit and inducted into Christ by adoption they become a part of the “seed” because “if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”—Gal. 3: 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ultimately the'members of the body of Christ will participate in dispensing the blessings to the people, because they are of Christ. This is illustrated by Isaac, the only son of Abraham, who took unto himself Rebecca for a wife, who shared with him. hi.s inheritance. Isaac was the head over Rebecca and she enjoyed what she had by virtue of being his wife. Christ is Head over the church,,his body, which enjoys what it will receive by reason of being the bride of Christ. It is therefore quite certain that the Apostle Paul, in Galatians 3:8, refers to the Gentiles who were justified by faith by reason of coming into Christ, and that such text does not ever refer to those who shall be blessed during the millennial reign of Christ.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Christ, the “seed” of promise, win dispense </span><span class="font5">the blessings to the peoples of earth. Their blessings &quot;will be reconciliation and restitution to human perfection. But this will not be accomplished by faith. Justification to the people will result from full obedience. Therefore when Paul said, “The scripture, foreseeing that the heathen should be justified by faith,” he referred not to the various nations but to the nonJews who become members of The Christ, There is no other name whereby salvation can come save that of Jesus Christ; and since all must receive their blessings through “the seed” it follows conclusively that those who are justified during the Christian era are justified by faith in the shed blood of Christ and thereby receive their portion of the blessings promised by the Abrahamic covenant. The reconciliation of the Christian is complete at the time of justification by faith.</span></h5>

<p><span class="font5">BRAHAM'S kinsman Lot was captured and carried away by enemies. Abraham went</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19281128_files/g_E_19281128-9.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">to his rescue and delivered Lot. - On his return Melchizedek, the king of Salem, met Abraham and served him with bread and wine and caused Abraham to be comforted and blessed. “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.”—■ Gen. 14:18-20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On this occasion was made another great picture. Melchizedek there pictured the great executive officer of Jehovah God appointed to carry out God’s purposes, including the blessings that God had promised to bestow upon mankind through the seed of Abraham. Melchizedek pictured the Logos, and Jesus, and Jesus Christ, the same mighty officer of Jehovah who bore all those titles. This is made clear from the Scriptures. It is written.concerning Jesus: “'Tiie Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.”—Ps. 110:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a reason, of. course, why Abraham came in contact with Melchizedek. Concerning this Paul writes: “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him: io whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace. . . . Now consider how great this man w<sup>T</sup>as, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: but he, whose descent is not counted from them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.”—Heb. 7:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the covenant. God made with Abraham he said: “In blessing I will bless thee”; and again: “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” It follows then that Abraham himself must receive a blessing, and that which is related in the .above scripture concerning him and Melchizedek shows that it is the Priest whom Melchizedek foreshadowed that bestows the blessing upon all, including Abraham himself. This proves that Abraham personally is subordinate to the covenant and to God’s royal Priest of the order of Melchizedek. This also makes it clear that in relation to the covenant Abraham is purely a figure representing God, who is the ■ real source of all blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mediator</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS observed that there is no mediator in the Abrahamic covenant. Not all covenants must have a mediator. If the covenant is made in which only one' binds himself, no mediator is required. If both parties to the covenant are competent to contract, a mediator is unnecessary. There are two good reasons why a mediator is not required in the Abrahamic covenant. (1) God obligated Himself to bless all the families of the earth, and this He would do regardless of what any one might do. The .covenant therefore was a one-sided or unilateral one and required no mediator. Therein Abraham is used as a figure representing Jehovah God. (2) Abraham had, at the time the covenant was made effective and binding, demonstrated his faith in God and therefore received God’s approval. His faith was counted unto him for righteousness or justification. Being counted righteous or justified he was competent to enter into a covenant with Jehovah. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">: ■ A mediator is a go-between, intercessor, or reconeilor. The entire human race must be reconciled to God by and through Jesus Christ There is no other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved and reconciled. (Acts 4:12) Jesus Himself said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cqmeth unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) The apostle declares: “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” (1 Tim. 2:5, 6) These scriptures do not have reference to a covenant, but undoubtedly refer to Jesus as the go-between or reconeilor between God and men. The members of the church are not brought into Christ by the mediator of a covenant, but they come by virtue of faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. The people of earth who are restored will get their restitution blessings through the ministration of the promises of a new covenant, and the “seed” of the Abraharnic covenant will be the instrument to bring these blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Abraham to Return</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N COURSE of time Abraham died without having received the blessings that had been promised. Long thereafter Stephen, moved by the power of the holy spirit, testified concerning Abraham and said: “And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.” (Acts 7:5) Paul, after making mention of the faith of Abraham and others, under the direction of the Lord wrote: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect” (Heb. 11: 39,40) It is manifest from these words that in God’s due time Abraham shall be brought forth from the tomb and fully receive the blessings himself that were promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s prophet writes: “He will ever be mindful of his covenant. . . . He hath commanded his covenant for ever.” (Ps. 111:5,9) This is an assurance that Abraham shall return from the tomb when the time is due to receive his personal blessings according to the promises of the covenant. God promised to bless him and He will ever be mindful of this His covenant, Abraham’s restoration is also implied by the words written: “Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham.” (Ex. 3: 6) Jesus placed an interpretation upon this statement of Jehovah when He said: “Now that tho dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” (Luke 20: 37) Because the covenant guarantees a future life to the dead Abraham, is manifestly the reason why Jehovah called Himself “the God of Abraham”. Also, that Abraham was the type of the everlasting God suggests that Abraham shall live again and never die any more. “Thou wilt perform . . . the mercy to Abraham.” (Mic. 7: 20) As a further guarantee, Jesus said: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heayen.” (Matt. 8:11) The kingdom will be that of the Messiah, which constitutes the priesthood of the Melchisedec order. Abraham will have a position in the kingdom of Messiah as a representative on the earth. This is shown by God’s covenant promise to Abraham.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HRIST is the instrument or royal Priest whom God will use during His thousandyear reign to bring all mankind who obey back into harmony with Himself. Then will be fully accomplished the terms of the covenant, because all the nations of earth will then have an opportunity to be reconciled to God. Those who obey God will be reconciled and fully restored. That will mark the complete fulfilment of the Abraharnic covenant. The other covenants mentioned, namely, the law covenant, the covenant by sacrifice, and the new covenant are ancillary to the Abraharnic covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the wonderful work of carrying out the Abraharnic promise to bless all the families of the earth the body members of Christ, first participating in the blessing, are privileged to participate in the bestowing of the blessing upon others. The first ones selected as a part of the “seed” were Jews. Thereafterward the members of the body were selected from the Gentiles, or heathen. These are the ones God has specially taken out as a people for His name. —Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">pie for his name.” (Acts 15:14) The people whom God has taken out for His name, in order to be faithful to Him, must be witnesses to His name. That is the reason why there is now going on in the earth a strenuous effort to give the witness to the name of Jehovah God and to tell the people that His kingdom is at hand. God tells us in His Word that He would have this done that the people mfiy be informed of His purposes of bringing about the reconciliation of man to Himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the parables taught by Jesus bears upon this same matter. A parable is a symbolic or figurative statement that pictures some reality. Jesus spoke a parable concerning a certain rich inan, Dives, and a beggar named Lazarus. (Luke 16:19-31) Dives represented the Jewish people who had received the special favor of Jehovah God. Lazarus pictured the nonJews, who had received no favor, therefore were in the attitude of beggars. “And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.”-— Luke 16:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dying of Dives and Lazarus represents a complete change of their respective conditions. Abraham, being a representative of the Lord, pictured God; Abraham’s bosom figuratively represented the place of God’s favor. God through Christ cast the Jews away, thereby completely withdrawing favor from them. The Gentiles or non-Jew’s then in due time were brought into the favor of God, and during the Christian era these have had the privilege of becoming members of the “seed” according to the promise made to Abraham. Those who have thus been brought into God’s favor and who have proven, faithful to their privileges of serving the Lord will in due time have a part in the work of reconciliation which God will do through Christ for the benefit of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this particular time in the outworking of the divine plan those who are thus favored, called and chosen of the Lord, have the great privilege of being God’s witnesses in the earth and thereby proving their loving devotion nnts God. (1 John 4:17,18) Faithfulness unto the end will assure such of being made fully and completely a part of the “seed”-of Abraham according to the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably many of you have wondered why God selected the Jews and for 1800 years extended to them special favors; why He made a special covenant with that people; why He gave them the first opportunity to be of the promised seed through which the blessings would come to all families of the. earth; why He cast them off as His people, and why they have suffered for such a long period of time since. Consideration will be given to these questions in a subsequent lecture. All Jews who really believe that Abraham was God’s great friend and the father of the Jewish nation will be keenly interested in what the Scriptures have to say about this matter. All Christians who are of the seed of Abraham, according to the promise certainly will be deeply interested in that particular matter of God’s dealing with natural Israel. All the human family should have a keen interest in the outworking of God’s plan for the reconciliation of man. The people must be brought to a knowledge of the truth; and now the Lord is affording an opportunity for those who want to know the truth concerning their salvation and future welfare to learn the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">f’yjESTION:</span><span class="font5"> I notice by the morning paper that some Episcopal minister will conduct a symbolic worship with, the subject, “The Gift of Holy Water.” Does the Bible make mention of this.holy water that a Christian should use as different from any other water?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font5"> No. This idea of holy water is not a part of the Christian worship. It is true that Aaron and his sons were washed before' the door of the tabernacle with water, as stated in Exodus 29:4, but even such ceremony is notto be followed by the Christian. At no place in the New Testament or any other place in the Bible is the Christian authorized to make distinctions in the use of waters. If there is such' a place, please give the scripture citation and send it in to this station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> How do we account for the many different races, on the earth today, and what was the color of Adam’s skin? ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> The Scriptures declare that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men”. (Acts 17:26) We accept this as correct. Changes of climate and environment have much to do with the color of the skin and with national characteristics. Thus there is a well-authenticated record of Jews who went to China; and in three hundred years these Jews, the hardiest race in the world, became Chinese in color of skin, complexion and eyes. No doubt the first man was of a swarthy color. Indeed, the word “Adam” means swarthy, and physicians are now discussing the question if it is not probably true that people with white skin are really sick, their systems being deficient. Prenatal conditions have much to do with life in every form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question;</span><span class="font5"> How did Christ preach to the spirits in prison?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer;</span><span class="font5"> With regard to 1 Peter 3:19, we would say that Christ’s faithfulness in doing the will of the heavenly Father even unto death, suffering the just for the unjust and going down into the tomb, only to be made alive by the heavenly Father on the spirit plane as a reward for His obedience and faithfulness, constituted to the fallen angels a sermon which one would think they could never forget. “By which [obedience unto death and resurrection from death] he went and preached [by example, as actions speak louder than words] unto the spirits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> Are there any scriptures that assure us that we who are here on earth at the time of the awakening in the resurrection will recognize our relatives who come forth from the graves ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer;</span><span class="font5"> Yes. Several scriptures clearly show that the individuals who came back from the graves will be recognized by those who will be living at the time of the awakening in the resurrection. In Luke 13:28 Jesus said to the Jews, “Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God.” Of course, to be aware of having seen them the Jews will have to recognize and know the prophets when they come forth in the resurrection. In Ezekiel 16:55 we read concerning the return of the Sodomites. This passage was written centuries after the destruction of the Sodomites, and must have application in the </span><span class="font6">resurrection. It </span><span class="font5">states, “When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.” To return to the former estate means to come back to the same land in which they were once destroyed, and certainly the Israelites will recognize that people. In Isaiah 35:10 we read of the great joy that will be in the earth at the return of the ransomed of the Lord, those •who are brought back from death. We read, “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee awmy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> What is the purpose of the faithful Christian in going to heaven? Will he sit down, wear a crown, sing songs, and do nothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> No. At the resurrection of the Christian during the second presence of the Lord Christ Jesus, the real work and service of the Christian will begin. The Christian is not called and tested in order that he might loaf when he goes to heaven. Christ Jesus and His faithful followers will be the chief agents of Jehovah God throughout the ages to come. Among the first works to be performed by the glorified Christians in the kingdom is to give the people of the •world the knowledge of the truth; to help them in the way of righteousness; to bind up the broken-hearted by bringing back their loved ones, by healing the sick and infirm, and by teaching them how to serve the Lord. During the kingdom time the saints will place the individuals of the world in general on trial That will be the trial or judgment period of a thousand years, in which each man not already tried will be put to the test and helped in the course of righteousness. In 1 Corinthians 6:2 we read, “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?” The end of the works of the faithful Christians is to bring praise and honor to the heavenly Father. In 1 Peter 2:9 we read, “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” Throughout the ages to come the knowledge and service of Jehovah will be the chief joy of this band of faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Children<sup>9</sup>® Own Radio Story </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J.</span><span class="font5"> IF., Jr. Story Eighteen</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">HEN Jesus, sitting upon the brink of the well outside of the cily of Sychar, in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Samaria, asked the woman of that city who came there to draw water, for a drink, the woman was greatly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">She said: “How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, rvhich am a woman of Samaria?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jesus answered and said: If thou kncwest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus meant that if the woman had known it was the Son of God who asked her for a drink, she would have prayed to Him that He would give her the water of life freely, or in other words, the precious words of TRUTH which Jesus came to preach and teach to all who would listen. But the woman did not understand the meaning of Jesus’ words, for she simply said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus explained: “Whosoever drinketh of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font5"> water [meaning ordinary natural water] shall thirst again, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall' give him [the water of TRUTH and the precious promises of Jehovah God] shall never thirst.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus meant, not that those who believed on Him and accepted the Truth from His lips would never get physically thirsty any more, but that their minds and hearts would always be green and fresh from thinldng on the beauties of God’s plan and telling others about Jehovah and His glorious Son, Jesus. Thus the Lord says of this water of TRUTH:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the woman said to Jesus: “Sir, give me this -water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.” And Jesus said to her, “Go, call thy husband, and come hither.” And the woman, not knowing who Jesus was, replied, “I have no husband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus said: “Thou hast well said, I have no husband, for thou hast had five husbands, Wd he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that thou saidst truly.” And the woman was astonished that Jesus knew all these things, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3.BS</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">said: “Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">¥ou see, she thought Jesus was a prophet or wise man of some sort, but did not dream that He was the Christ Himself. So the woman of Sychar spoke further to Jesus and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things.” And Jesus said to the woman, “I that speak unto thee am he.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time the disciples returned from the city, where they had been to buy food, and found Jesus talking with the woman, and marveled. But none of them asked Jesus why He talked to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the woman learned from Jesus that He ■was the Messiah, she left her waterpot at the well, and hastened into the city, telling every one whom she knew that she had found the Lord. “Come,” said she, “see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?” For Jesus had told the woman oflrer five husbands, and also that she had not been married according to the law, which of course He knew; but the woman did not know that He knew it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible says that the people..of Sychar to whom the woman had spoken concerning Jesus “went out of the city and came unto him. And many of the Samaritans believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. So when the Samaritans ■were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them, and he abode there two days. And many more believed because of his own word: and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him ourselves: and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our Lord’s experience with this woman we get a glimpse of His graeious..heart. Tie did not seek a “prospect” to whom to preach, but seized the first opportunity. Doubtless He saw in her the honest heart which the heavenly Father values beyond all veneer of so-called culture, and therefore gave her a foretaste of “the water of life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two days’ visit in Samaria being over, Jesus continued His journey and arrived in Galilee, in that city, Cana of Galilee, where tho water was turned into wine as His first giiracle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Music and Musical Instruments</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE musical instruments of the Bible are of three kinds: stringed instruments, consisting of the harp, psaltery, viol, dulcimer and sackbut; wind instruments, consisting of the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe and trumpet; and instruments of percussion, as bells, cymbal and tabret, or timbrel. Jubal, great-great-greatgreat grandson of Cain, is given as the inventor of two of these, the harp and organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Jacob’s father-in-law, Laban, was familiar - with the tabret (tambourine) and harp, while Job was familiar with these two and with the . organ, so that the essentials of an orchestra were then in more or less common use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the ark was first brought into Jerusalem the accompanying orchestra consisted of psalteries, harps and cymbals. The psaltery &gt;&nbsp;resembled a guitar. Subsequently the regular temple orchestra is said to have consisted of two to six psalteries, two to twelve flutes, trumpets from two upward without limit, harps from nine upward, and cymbals, only one pair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The root word in the Hebrew, used to denote the inspiration under which the prophets spoke, is the same as that under which the min. strels sang. It is supposed that the enthusiasm of the true prophets for the name of Jehovah and that of the false prophets for Baal is the reason for this use of the Hebrew root. Music w i thout enthusiasm would hardly be music at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The encyclopedia tells us that stringed in-■ struments played with bows were unknowm at the beginning of the Christian era and that the ■ historical statement that Nero fiddled ’while .....- Rome burned must be put where many other .........■- historical statements belong, in the realm of myths.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">greatest composers, ami found the favorites thirteen in number and in the' following order: Beethoven, Wagner, Bach, followed rather lamely by Mozart, Brahms, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Bizet and Franck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The musical masterpieces themselves were voted as.seventeen in number: Die Meistersinger, Mass in B-Minor, Fifth Symphony, Tristan and Isolde, followed, after a big drop, by Don Giovanni, Brahm’s First Symphony, Mendelssohn’s Concerto for Violin, Chopin’s Sonata in B-FIat Minor, Schumann’s Piano Concerto, L’Apres-midi d’un Faun, Beethoven’s Sonata Opus III, Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony, St. Matthew Passion, Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony, Schubert’s Erlking and Parsifal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beethoven was and is a mystery to mankind. Music dominated his life, yet he was fussy, untidy, suspicious, and did not hesitate to abuse an innocent waiter by pouring a dish of hot stew over his head, meantime roaring with laughter until the tears ran down his face. He arose from his death-bed to shake his fist at the lightning and hail that disturbed his last moments on earth. One of his original manuscripts recent! j<sup>7</sup> sold for $3,600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of all great musicians named above, Mendelssohn is believed to have had the most marvelous memory. He seldom needed a score, and before his death he played through from meifiqi ry the whole of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. It is told of him that on one occasion, when rehearsing without score a chorus from Bach's St. Matthew Passion, he called out at a cer-, tain point: “Please note that at the twenty-third bar the sopranos have C, and not C Sharp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of these composers enjoyed excellent health. Bach and Brahms were among those, the latter never sick in his life and able to sleep, at any time or place as long as he pleased;;. Wagner* stood on his head at sixty for the sheer fun of showing his friends how much he enjoyed life. Mozart and Schubert died young, anil in poverty, but their works will live for ever. &lt;&nbsp;One of the works of the composer Rossini has an overture and a half because .Rossini hated to get out of bed. He had. partly completed an overture, writing in bed, when he dropped off to sleep. Awaking, he tried to recover his manuscript without leaving the bed. Finding that he could not reach it without too much effort lie started afresh.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Music Is</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">USIC is the expression of tones produced by the mathematically regular vibrations of resonant bodies, in contradistinction to a confusion of irregular vibrations designated as noise. Middle C has 256 vibrations to the second, and is produced by sound waves something less than nine feet apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Waves at half that distance apart produce a tone one octave higher, half that again the next octave higher. The human ear is able to compass eleven octaves, but there are animals which can hoar notes higher and lower than is possible to any Iranian being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The practical range of music is from 40 to 4,000 vibrations a second embracing seven octaves.. The highest note on the piano readies 4,224 vibrations, while the piccolo reaches 4,752 vibrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thomas Edison complains that while there are something like 400.000,000 possible changes in tunes, yet he found in going over thousands of humorous songs that for the most part they were written to only nine tunes. He said that lie found by reversing some of the tunes the results were far more interesting and charming than the originals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While music was and is largely an appeal to the emotions, yet it is also an appeal to the intellect; and it was the harmonization of these two factors that made Beethoven and Wagner the two greatest composers that have yet appeared upon the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gomposers have pictured every imaginable sound, the hoof-beats of horses, the fluttering of wings, the voices of animals, the rippling of w’aters, the patter of rain, the crashing of t.tiiundeiy and so on ad infinitum. Some of the recent compositions brave attempted to imitate riveting-machines, airpiana propellers, locomotive whistling and hissing, etc. Whether some of these late pieces are really music, or just noise, is a subject now being animatedly discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Human Voice</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;DROBABLY the songs of the angels, when we get to hear them, if we ever do, are more beautiful than the songs of humans; but. so far as most of us have any direct knowledge, or are likely ever to have, the human voice is the most exquisite musical instrument ever made. Who that has heard the incomparable Russian Nightingale, Maria Kurenko, over the radio, can ever forget the inexpressible sweetness of that voice? But, by the end of the Millennial Age, most of the human family will no doubt be able to sing equally well. It is a gift .from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only is the human voice a gift from God, but there is reason to believe that He enjoys hearing mankind converse with one another. The Scriptures liken the murmur of multitudes in converse with one another to the babbling waters of the brook and declare that when they speak of God. and of their reverence for Him and their hopes in Him that He hearkens and hears and makes record in His book of remembrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A normal infant sings and is able to enjoy music before he can either walk or talk. The mother’s lullabies serve a real purpose in the child life. They gratify a natural desire and begin, the child’s musical training. It is astonishing what a musical mother can do for a child, both before and after the child’s birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tone qualities are inherited. A tenor husband and. contralto wife will have tenor-and contralto children. A basso husband and soprano wife will have basso and soprano children. Marriages between bassos and contraltos, or between tenors and sopranos, result in baritone boys and mezzo-soprano girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enrico Caruso’s wonderful voice, perhaps the most rich and powerful tener ever known, is not entirely lost to mankind, even if there were no phonograph records of it, because his little eight-year-old daughter is said to have fallen heir to it. She has already done a phonograph' record, though the record is not for sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Few Celebrities</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">adame Sch uma w-IIeimic, now sixty-seven years of age, always attracts great crowds of appreciative listeners whenever she elects</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to sing. She is said to he a very lovable woman, who persisted in the training of her voice alter her teacher jn Vienna told her sue had no personality and would belter buy a sewing-machine and go to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Melba is sixty-three years of age and has already sung several farewells; but singers like Melba or S <sup>V</sup>mr.a»:n-Heink can sing as many ... farewells as they like and the public will always come again when they have one more. Adelina Patti sang farewells for about twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jean de Reszke, the man of.two voices, passed out of this life three years ago, at about the same time as Enrico Caruso, his greatest rival. De Reszke, after a brilliant career as a baritone, astonished mankind by an even more brilliant career as a tenor. De Reszke was two men in one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The possession of two voices at cnee is a gift - which nature sometimes bestows. A London singer, Strathie Mackay, has the power to make one of his vocal chords vibrate at half the rate of the ether, or at a third, fourth or fifth of the rate; and, as a consequence, while singing the ordinary C in the treble clef he is able to sing the C in the bass also, two octaves lower. When discovered, Mackay was earning his living by cleaning windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Years ago the noted musical instructor Lou Wiley made a similar discovery at Bradford, Pa. He was stopping at a hotel when his trained ear heard one of the girls in the. kitchen sing four lines of a familiar piece, the first line in soprano, the next in alto, the next in tenor and the next in bass. She became one of the musical ' celebrities of her day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Love of the Human Voice</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">LMOST anybody will pause for at least a moment to catch a little of the beauty’ of</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280627_files/g_E_19280627-3.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">a song from somebody who really knows how to sing. Last year at Tuebingen, Germany, a through express train was delayed four minutes because conductor, brakemen, porters and travelers stood in rapt attention while an Italian tenor sang an aria from “Tosca” in one Of the coaches. And it was after midnight, too. n-.w-’-'s of small means are often to be seen at the Metropolitan Opera House, New Yoiri. They have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> stand in the rear of the top gallery, font they are there, in any went. One standee found himself in company with, a Russian piano teacher, a German butcher, an Italian laborer and a Cuban music student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is known that the radio is hurting the concert stage, if not killing it, though some managers claim to the contrary; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">yet</span><span class="font7"> today there are very few famous voices that are not heard over the radio. Millions of people have heard famous singers by radio who otherwise Avon Id never have heard them. Louise Homer and John McCormack, and Walter Damrosch, musical director, are often heard over the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes a person gets a little too much music. A Harlem opera singer of note, one who had sung with Caruso and Melba, was haled into court by an irate neighbor because be had such a powerful voice that lie even shook the dishes in the cupboard below. The judge decided that he could sing between 8 a.m. 'and 10 p.m., and as loudly and powerfully as he liked, but must remain mute after that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most popular love songs north of the Arctic Circle is “My Girl is Like a Fish”, the most beautiful thing the young man has ever seen, and the song is as popular with the girls as it is with the boys. Down in this part of the world, if a young man would tell his best girl that she is like a fish, it is doubtful whether he would make a hit with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Violin, Most Perfect Work of Mas</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280627_files/g_E_19280627-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE violin, or fiddle (either name is correct), is the most perfect work of man. In its perfected form it has been in existence about four hundred years. The tops are usually made of soft, straight-grained wood, as pine, spruce or balsam; while the hack, sides, neck and head are usually made of hard, highly-figured wood, as maple, sycamore or beech. The inner blocks and linings are usually of pine. All the wood is cut to the quarter, to enhance the tone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While there are differences in size, outline, arching, sound-holes, peg-bokes, the swing of the scroll, the shape of the button, and the heights of the ribs and sides, yet little change in the violin seems possible or even desirable. The violins made today are no better than, if as good as, those made three hundred years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737)-was the acknowledged king of voilin-makers. The instruments which he made are all catalogued. One-third of them are now in the United States. One purchased in 1923 by Zimhalist cost hhn $33,000. It is considered one of the four finest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in the' world. It is called the &quot;Titian” because ' made of bright red wood. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' Only less famous than Stradivari were other violin-makers of his day, Guarnerius del Gesu, NW Carlo Bergonzi and Amati. One of their secrets, the making of a solution of amber called Ore-mona 'Varnish, has been recently rediscovered ......after being lost for two hundred years. The .......popular belief that old violins are valuable -merely because they are old has no support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that the tone quality of a violin which has become sluggish may be improved by placing its sound-holes in close proximity to a radio loud speaker while good violin music is being reproduced. It not infrequently happens that valuable violins are ruined when they fall into the hands of repairmen who do not understand their business.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ritz Kreisler, recognized as one of the greatest violinists of all time, is also a very fine man personally. It is said that the bulk of his earnings goes to care for the poor, the very poor, those unable to help themselves. Kreisler suffered much during the World War, and for no reason except that he is of German stock. He is one of the few great artists who never broadcast, because he believes the radio injurious to his profession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This last season New York, little old blase New York, went wild over a child violinist, the first time anything like that has happened in forty years. Yehudi Meiiuhim, ton years of age, played in Carnegie Hall to standing-room only, while the ablest musicians in New York wiped their eyes because he expressed so perfectly the emotions which charged their beings. The little fellow is quite unspoiled and has gone back to school at his home in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now for a contrast! Imagine, if you can, a New York millionaire enroute from Europe to New York, who paid a noted violinist $500 to move to a distant part of the boat, because he so detested music and did not wish to hear him playing in a nearby cabin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably that millionaire was a brother to the banker who had one glass eye of which he was very proud. He told an acquaintance that one of his eyes was glass, and asked him to guess which was his good one. Without hesitation the man replied, &quot;The left one is your good one.” Asked how he knew, he said, “Because it has so much more sympathy in it.” It transpired that the left eye was the one made of glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every autumn Atlanta, Ga., has a fiddlers’ contest. No one who can. read music by note is allowed to compete. The present holder of the title was on one occasion' let out of jail so that he could enter a contest of the. same kind, and he won the contest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paris is trying out a mechanical violin-player, the violinista, which is to the violin what the player-piano is to the piano. The notes are produced by perforated rolls, the same as on the player-piano. It is hard to believe that this invention can ever come to anything; yet it may. with us, though even the “forte” is little used in describing the instrument. The instrument in its present form is about two hundred years old.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">&quot;WTHEN old Nebuchadnezzar comes back and “ » hears Paderewski or Rubinstein or Franz</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Liszt or Chopin or Mendelssohn sit down at a , Steinway concert grand piano and play one. of the Hungarian Rhapsodies or a Beethoven ‘ Concerto through to a finish and then goes and . looks at it, won’t he be surprised when he finds . what his old dulcimer o C 60G B. C. has come to be ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Originally the dulcimer, had only two hammers, one in each hand of the musician. What, he could do with those two hammers was all he</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. could do. Now a Chicago musician with an eye _ to figures announces that in. the four minutes required to play Rubinstein’s “Staccato Etude” he exerted a force of 14,700 pounds on the keyboard. Some difference!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The harpsichord, superseded by the piano, was played with quills instead of hammers. The clavichord, also superseded by the piano, was much appreciated in its day because the tones could be made to quiver and thus give an echoing or trembling sound of exquisite sweetness and responsiveness. It was the favorite instrunient of Beethoven, Bach and all the early masters. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An attachment consisting principally of a fourth pedal can now be had which restores this clavichord quality of the piano. It enables performers to hold or swell or diminish musical tones after the piano keys have been struck. It is the invention of John Hays Hammond, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- Christofari, an Italian harpsichord builder, was the first to put hammers on his instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ He called his completed work “ccmhala colo : piano forte”, meaning “harpsichord with soft ; and loud”. The words “piano forte” still remain</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the first pianotuners, is considered the father of modern music. Before his time musicians had only a limited number of keys in which to write their music, as they could not tune their instruments to other keys”; but he discovered the lost notes hidden in the strings and began to write music in keys hitherto unknown. Mozart, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, and Rubinstein became his admirers and followers. It is admitted in Mu-rope that the best pianos and harps in the world are made in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Few Piano Celebrities</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Paderewski, generally considered the world’s greatest pianist, began his musical education at the Warsaw Conservatory of Music, his professors told him his .hands were not long enough to make., a good pianist and that he should give up the piano for a trombone. Since then the entire musical world has been glad to listen to him. Incidentally, he was the first president of his native land, Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paderewski was glad to give up political life and to get back to tIm piano. On one occasion he had surgical operations performed on the tips of all his fingers, to 'enable him to better reach the octave. His life has been one of hard work and well-deserved success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Percy Grainger, another noted pianist, is accredited with, saying: “Anybody can become proficient at the piano. I’ll go further and say that anybody can become expert, even become a virtuoso, by ceaseless practice. The multitudes who never get anywhere are simply not sufficiently interested in their ambition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new device for teaching- the piano consists of lights which appear above the keys on the student’s piano, aiding correct fingering and reading of notes. These lights are produced by electrical contacts from the instructors piano, who plays along with his pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most curious piano celebrities of all time was Blind Tom, who died four years ago. lie was a simpleton in everything except music, but had the remarkable power of remembering pertcetly and reproducing exactly any Jgge||p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-his &lt;&nbsp;presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Additionally, he could turn his back to-the piano, and with his hands behind him, play “The Fisher’s Hornpipe” -with one hand, “Yankee Doodle” with the other, and at the same time sing “Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Ard Marching”,.in such a way that the three tunes-were melodiously intertwined. At ail his concerts Tom always led the applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In moth-infested climates piano users are recommended to always keep two small mothbags inside the piano. It may save much ex-pense in repairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe Organs and Bagpipes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">RGANS of all kinds are in much less demand than they were a generation ago, and yet the music is peculiarly majestic, restful and desirable. Moreover, organ-playing is good exercise, is an aid to good complexion ami is an effective antidote for lassitude or ennui.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pipe-organs are now played by electric motors so skilfully that listeners do not know the difference between machine operation and manual playing by an artist. As with playerpianos and other similar devices the music is obtained by the operation of perforated paper rolls crossing a slotted bar. With this mechanism a large pipe-organ can be operated anywhere without the aid of a musician. Indeed, radios and mechanical devices of all sorts axe rapidly putting an end to the hopes of thousands of musicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pipe-organ in Roosevelt Park, Toi ranee, California, near Los Angeles, is so powerful that it was necessary to remove the console to a point a hundred feet away from the organ proper. When brought closei* the organist’s bench trembled so decidely that she was unable to obtain, the delicate effects required for fine music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some Scots maintain that the organ ployed by Jubal was a bagpipe without the bag; others* claim that the instrument originated in Chaldea and has been traced to Persia, Greece and Rome and thence to Scotland; while others, not Scots, are mean enough to claim that Some Highland cottager got the idea through stepping on a cat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bagpipe has nine tones, which have nothing to do with the chromatic scale and therefore nothing to do with music, yet there is no musical instrument in the world today which is as national and as much beloved by its users as the bagpipe. Bagpipe music can not be transposed from one key. to another, and as an instrument it is always out of tune. Newer makes have corrected these evils somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A bagpipe is similar to a church organ in principle. The player maintains the wind pressure on his drones and chanter by keeping the •hag full of wind and regulates the volume of sound by the pressure of his arm on the bag. There are still traveling pipers in Scotland who have all the pride engendered by living up to centuries of traditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pipers of today, like those of a thousand years ago, are attired in plaid jackets, kilts and hose. Brooches hold the plaids at the shoulders. Jeweled dirks and powder-horns are at their sides. Jeweled eases containing knives and forks are in their garters. They still wear the tartans of their clans and sway slowly from side to side, as they play, just as the pipers have always done from time immemorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Banjo, Flute, Kettle-Drum</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■rpHE banjo, recognized for many years as •— America’s national musical instrument, but which for a time was nearly lost to sight, is now having a revival and in the bauds of a good performer is a very entertaining and rhythmical instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Cincinnati professor has made a collection of flutes and a study of them. There are 711 specimens in his collection, -among them flutes made of gold, jade, a rain’s horn and glass. 'When special effects are desired, the Boston Symphony Orchestra sends to Cincinnati to borrow the golden flute, finding no other instrument quite as sweet in tone quality. All these instruments have had their musical values determined by motion-pictures of the waves which they produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tones of the kettle-drum, indicated by the usual notes written in the bass clef, are of the lowest register that the human ear can perceive, and as the tuning is wholly dependent upon the ear, the process is more difficult than is that of tuning any other orchestral instrument. The tympanist, as the performer on' a kettle-drum is called, must be a real musician. He is sometimes called ffihe conductor from the rear”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oboe, Saxophone, Trombone</span></p>

Of course this has no musical significance, but is purely of interest as showing how long a single breath can be expended without any fresh intake.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The saxophone was invented in 1846 by a young man named Sax, a resident of Belgium and later of Paris. Though an excellent flute and clarinet player and a splendid workman, he was a poor business man and died penniless and forgotten. It was not until after his death that the saxophone gained its greatest favor. The saxophone is made in nine different sizes and styles, covering a wider range than any other family of instruments. It is easier to play than any other instrument, and is used principally for jazz bands or ragtime music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The trombone was well known to the ancient Romans, and it is believed it may have been used by the Greeks also. The ancient bands of Venice consisted of trombones only. There were ten in the state band of Henry VIII, and six in the state bands of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth.</span></p>

While music is being rendered by the singer or violinist the performer is flooded with lights of various colors and intensities, suited to the musical theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Canadian, Morse Bobb, has invented an electrical -wave organ, an instrument in which the sound is produced electrically instead of by the blowing of air through pipes. It occupies little space and can be moved about with ease. It is claimed that this electrical organ can duplicate all the work of a cumbrous pipe-organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much attention lias been given in the past year to the invention of Prof. Leo Theremin, of the Physicotechnical Institute of Leningrad, which produces ether-wave music by simply waving the hands before a modified radio transmitter. It, produces strange new sounds of a resonance and beauty that no musical instrument has yet been able to achieve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f - ff</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Few Words About Jazz</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">AZZ is not. music, but is syncopation imported from Africa and used there for the same purpose for which it is used here, namely, to arouse passion. In America it was introduced by Chas. Washington, an African drummer in Vicksburg. “Chaz,” as he was commonly caHed. could not read music, but had the natural gift, of syncopation, brought from Africa and handed down by his forebears. It is the Devil’s own music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the eatchiness of “Chaz’s” drumming lie was called on to do his best on repeats. At the end of the chorus the leader would say, “Now, Chaz!” From this beginning came the wide- spread use of Chaz, more commonly spelled jazz. It had its origin in ragtime some quarter of a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jazz has literally turned Handel’s Messiah into “Yes, We Have No Bananas”. Chopin was drawn upon for “My Alice Blue Gown” and “I’m Always Chasing Rainbows”. Strauss’s “The Beautiful Blue Danube” was the reservoir from which was drawn “Iola”. “The Volga Boat Song” was turned by the jazzers into “Russian Rose”, while “Lohengrin” was murdered to produce the buffoonery of “Where Did _ You Get That Hat?” All this is the murder of’ real music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sir Henry Coward, famous English musician, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Jazz is a low type of primitive music, found-ed on crude rhythms suggested by stamping, feet and clapping hands. It puts emphasis on the grotesque by the banging and clanging of pots and pans or any shimmering metallic substance reinforced with special drums. It debases both music and instruments by making both farcical. The noble trombone is made to bray like an ass, guffaw like a village idiot and moan like a cow in distress. The silver-toned trumpet, associated, in poetry with seraphim, is made to screech and produce sounds like drawing a nail in a slate, tearing calico, or the wailing of a nocturnal tomcat. Jazz can not be made anything but the essence of vulgarity. The popularization of jazz and the attendants immodest dances is lowering the prestige of the white races.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many places the churches have gone in for jazz. But why not? They have gone in for every fool thing ever proposed, and if they refused to adopt jazz it would be a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When an orchestra was sent to a zoo iuj Philadelphia to record the reactions of the ani-1 mals to jazz it is recorded that Poetre, a twelve-1 year-old Asiatic elephant, was so disgusted that I he blew a trunkful of water all over his tor-1 mentors.

<p><span class="font7">TJTTA percha is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span><span class="font7"> of cable construction. If it had never been discovered it is doubtful if there would be any submarine cables in the world today. It is apparently the only insulator sufficiently perfect to enable a wire to be carried through thou- -sands of miles of ocean depth and to bear upon its surface the news and business of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the latest cables there is now a thin wrapping of permalloy between the copper cables and the gutta percha exterior. This permalloy,......•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">composed of eighty percent pure nickel and twenty percent pure iron, is the most easily magnetized and demagnetized of all metals, making it peculiarly valuable for submarine work, where large magnetic effects are desired from small currents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are three sizes of cable: 'deep sea,’ which is one inch in diameter and is laid where there is practically no movement on the bottom; 'intermediate,’ which <sub>S</sub>is one and three-fourths inches in diameter and is used where there are greater strains; and 'shore end’, which is two and three-fourths inches in diameter ami is used close to shore, where the strains are greatest of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In laying cable an effort is- made to avoid subterranean mountain peaks, precipices ami gorges. Theoretically the cable should always lie in a bed of level mud. Just such a bed, four hundred miles wide, stretches from Europe to America in the North Atlantic. It is known as ‘Telegraph Plateau’, and was seemingly placed where it was .placed by the Creator for the very purpose for which it is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Three Great Inventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HREE g<sup>r</sup>eat inventions may be said to have made the cable a practical thing for everyday use. The first was the siphon recorder, invented by Lord Kelvin in 1870, an extremely delicate device by which a tiny siphon, with one end in the ink bottle and the other suspended over the paper, splutters tiny droplets of ink .....■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">on the moving paper as the feeble signals come i in from the other side of the world. This -:~ magnetically operated instrument is the most <sub>: </sub>important part of modern cable apparatus. o The second great invention doubled the spqgd........</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of all cables. This invention by Dr.. Alexander I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">C24</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">TjWRGET,. for a moment, that you are living Jr in the wireless age, and think of the splendid achievements of the past sixty years in the field of submarine cables, during which time the earth has been girdled with a mileage of cables which would reach around it more than thirteen times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1852 Dover and Ostend were connected by a cable seventy-five miles long, and two years later Sweden and Denmark were connected, as were also Italy and Corsica, and Corsica and Sardinia. The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, but. the current was so feeble that a message of ninety words took sixty-seven minutes to transmit. The cable weighed a ton to the mile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first practical transatlantic cable, laid in 1886, was lighter and stronger than the foregoing; but although if is now 'dead’, it served a great purpose in its day. The first tariff rates were $100 for twenty words, with $5 for each additional word. In 1872 the rates dropped to $1 a word and now range from 121c to $1.33, depending on destination and service desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the first transatlantic cables the 'speed was about seven words a minute in one direction, while now the speed is forty to forty-five words a minute and in both directions, so that the carrying capacity of the cables is ten to twelve times what it was originally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first messages .required five to ten hours for delivery, where now the ordinary commercial time is thirty to sixty minutes, and for stock exchange purposes replies are often back in less than three minutes. Messages have been relayed around the world to point of origin in eight minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that a single Paris bankinghouse saves 10,500 francs a day by depositing each evening at the Central Telegraph Office four hundred reply-paid cablegrams to America. Each of the cablegrams contains three words, including address and signature. The saving is due to differences in exchange and in cable tolls when paid in Paris as compared with New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vast sums are saved every day through the coding of messages. One code word frequently stands for ten or fifteen words, and sometimes for as many as one hundred.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Muirhead and Herbert Taylor, in 1875, rendered it possible to send messages both ways at the same time. Where the outside speed of cables had been thirty words a minute, with twenty as a good high speed, the cable was now capable of as high as sixty words a minule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The third great invention was the simple and beautiful and efficient one of first punching the message as a series of holes in a paper tape. This perforated tape is then run through an automatic transmitter, and by means of a system of small levers the required signals are transmitted at any desired speed within the cable’s capacity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">F ALL parts of the ocean were of uniform depth, and if there were no sharp rocks to tear a cable, and no currents to sway and weaken it, no icebergs to grind it in two, no ship-anchors to tear it, no borers to cut into it, and no whales, sawfish or swordfish to attack it, cable maintenance would be quite a simple matter; but any of these things are liable to happen, and they all have happened many times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">..... The carcass of a whale has been hauled up from the ocean depths wrapped round and round in the loops of the cable which he mistakenly attacked. A. shark’s tooth has been found embedded in a cable covering. Trawls •■•or fishing boats have often caught and disrupted cables. The-•first cable froin England to France was picked up by a fisherman who thought it was a new kind of eel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cable repair ships carry about two hundred miles of repair cable in their tanks, and their .cruises, keep them out for six weeks at a time. Much of their work is near shore, because the worst corrosions take place at the shore ends, on account of the decomposed matter near the surface of the water. In ease of a break an expert repairman can locate the trouble electrically within a mile ; but the repairing of the Incak is not such an easy matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The usual time for bringing a cable to the deck of the repair vessel is about eight hours, for each end. Often, when it has almost reached the deck, the end of the cable will ■a fresh place and slide mockingly back Jp^sjgndgSliinesat' the .bottom. Repairs go on night and day and in all weathers. Cable repairing is a he-man’s job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn warm waters the marine borer is a menace against which the only protection is a sheath of brass. Deep sea cable costs about $400 a nule, while shore end cable may cost as much as</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">a mile. 'The repairman is, of course, expected to be as economical as possible in the use of this expensive material. There are fifty cable laying and repair steamers in the world.</span></p>

The 3,600-mi.le stretch from Vancouver to Fanning Island is the longest single cable section in the world. The only places where this British, telegraph girdle touches foreign.territory are at Madeira and St. Vincent, in the Cape Verde Islands, both belonging to Britain’s old ally, Portugal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Eat White Bread</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font7">AT white bread. You should eat more and more of it. The more of it you eat, especially if it is widely advertised and is exceptionally white, the better standing you will have with .your undertaker, and the better rating he will have in Dun’s and Bradstreet’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a reason for this. The white bread alone, even if you made it yourself, would be a big help to you in getting an early ride in the big black wagon, because it is robbed of eight of the minerals which you have in your body and which you need to keep constantly supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eat plenty of white bread. The more of it you eat the more quickly your doctor and druggist can retire; but you will retire first, head down. As a system for breaking down your eliminating apparatus and making you a first-class constipated American, nothing can equal it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eat plenty of white bread, the widbly advertised, ultra-white kind. Patent No. 1,158,934, now owned by the Ward Baking Company, of New York, shows that with each 100 pounds of bread you are entitled to chew and swallow along with it 1.75 ounces of plaster of paris. The use of this plaster of paris may not be as good for you as for the bread trust. When plenty of plaster of paris is used in mixing bread it is not necessary to use nearly so much sugar, and sugar is expensive, and besides that plaster of paris makes the bread very white, and people like to eat nice white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eat plenty of white bread. Be sure that it is widely advertised. Patent No. 1,158,933, also evened by the Ward Baking Company, of New York, shows that with each 100 pounds of bread there is coming your way .64 ounce of sal ammoniac. It used to be that all the sal ammoniac obtainable came from Egypt, where the sole source of supply w’as a soot formed by burning the dung of black cattle, horses, sheep and goats. The present supply is obtained otherwise, but as human food it is every way as desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stick to the white bread. If it is widely advertised, it will help you to show your loyalty to your fiiahorhood’ druggist. Patent No. 1,151,526, also owned by the Ward Baking Company, of New York, shows that with every 100 pounds you become a candidate for .0176 ounce of potassium bromate. That is not very much, but you would not need many bromides to make you popular with the makers of embalming fluids. Eat white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Good Luck” Letters</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">NE of our valued contributors, writes us that he recently received an anonymous “Good Luck” letter which he was commanded to copy and send to four friends within twenty-four hours, otherwise he would have “Bad Luck”. Needless to say he threw it into the flames. Numerous such letters come to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> They all go the same route, via the waste basket They are usually illiterate, meaningless jumbles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is surprising that anybody, at this day and age, could have any confidence in any superstition; yet there are many such. No superstitious. person has any love for God, any confidcmce in Him, any desire to please Him. Superstition is the exact opposite of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To suppose that a God of wisdom, justice, love and power would be swayed one way or the other by the copying of a fool letter four times or four million times is ridiculous; but it all looks very serious to bead counters and holywater worshipers, whose deity seems to require a vast deal of the most abject and senseless kind of propitiation on the part of his numskull subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tribune Evolutionists Terrified</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font7">IKE almost all other newspapers in the world today the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> has on its staff believers in evolution, but no believers in Almighty God, so far as we are aware. Apparently, if there are any believers in Almighty God, they are of little influence in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune’s</span><span class="font7"> office. But the evolutionists seem to have everything their own way, and it is a timid, shivering, fearsome way, a way which shrinks from truth as from the black plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Away back last spring, May 8, 1927, to be exact, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> published an fidiotorial’ entitled “'Men and Apes”, which contained the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There exists one pre-human fossil, and only one, which firm regard for proved fact requires us to accept as intermediate between man and the ape. This is Pithecanthropus Erectus, often called the 'ape-man of Java’. Few as are the bony fragments of this remarkable creature which Professor Eugene Dubois discovered, these fragments suffice to establish the creature as having a bodily structure, a brain capacity and probably a set of habits between those of modern man and of the higher living apes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It happens that seventeen days prior to that time </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> under the title “The Only Proof of Evolution”, had published the following : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only proof of evolution that we have is that the evolutionists persist in making such monkeys of themselves. A little while ago they filled the Sunday specials with their loud and profusely illustrated announcements of the discovery of the missing link, the Pithecanthropus Erectus, as they called it. It was good of them to give us this fancy name for the original monkey which they claim as their ancestor. But once more the so-called scientists who are eager to glorify themselves and to discredit Almighty God in the eyes of man have been shown up on the front pages for what they are. Archaeologists of the National Museum at Washington have announced positively that the skull of the Pitheeanthropus Erectus is merely the knee-bone of an elephant. And that’s that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It also happens that the subscribers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> are among the most truth-hungry and critical denizens of the globe, and when one Bich had seen the two statements, and compared them, and had seen, that they agreed not the one with the other, he arose in his wrath and sent a letter to Washington inquir-which of the two. editors was to be believed, or whether it was exclusively editors the apostle had in mind when he said, “All men are liars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the lapse of ten days, the letter meantime having reached the proper desk, back came a response from W. deC. Ravenel, acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, reading as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of May 9 and, in reply to your inquiry, I beg to say that the so-called Pithecanthropus Erectus is now generally considered to be the top part of a humerus of a fossil elephant. A note on the subject was published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 'Volume X, No. 1, 1927. You can undoubtedly consult this article in the New York Public Library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having by this means ascertained that one of the editors was not a liar, Mr. Rich undertook to see how about the other, and wrote a fine letter to the managing editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font7"> enclosing a copy of Mr. Ravenel’s letter and suggested a correction of the editorial. Mr. Rich in his letter even suggested that the best way out would be to write a “humerus” sketch and deny the whole evolution theory, and give the reasons which he also gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In three days came an acknowledgement that the correspondence had been handed to the editorial writers. Ten weeks later Mr. Rich jogged their failing memories and learned to his surprise that no trace of the previous correspondence was to be found; so he sent fresh copies and waited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">November came around and nothing had been done to correct the error, so Mr. Rich jogged them again. Still no result. Why should an editor admit a mistake? Few of them ever do. Most of them prefer to have their subscribers think they are infallible, and the worst of it is that most of the subscribers are just foolish enough to think that they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On came 1928 and when the “'million-dollar tooth” of the original Nebraska man turned out to be a wild pig’s tooth, the wise evolutionist who wields the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune’s</span><span class="font7"> ‘idiotorial’ pen on scientific subjects felt called upon to say something; so he said, February 21: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To imply that the theory of evolution is in the least endangered by this discovery of a mistake about a single fossil is as though a bridge builder abandoned his bridge and helped to destroy it because a single girder, not yet built into the structure, was found de-foctivo ot' the testing floor. Certainly no evolutionist Mww that the theory is impaired. Had the tooth proved really to belong to some man-like or ape-like creature, that might have meant something about the history of the New World monkeys. It would neither have strengthened nor weakened materially the idea that evolution is a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was too much for Mr. Rich; so he took a farewell shot at the long-suffering but timid, fearsome and faint-hearted managing editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune.</span><span class="font7"> And because it seems such a pity that Mr. Rich should make such a bold attack on an important editor we print the whole of Mr. Rich’s Exhibit No. 12:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">February 23, 1928</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. A. B. Holcombe, Managing Editor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New York Herald-Tribune,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">225 W. 40th Street, New York, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Mr. Holcombe:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I want to take just one more shot at your editorials on evolution, even though you conveniently lost my former correspondence, concerning the Pithecanthropus Eroctns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In your editorial of February 21, 1928, you state in the second paragraph, “It- would neither have strength-cried nor weakened the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="font5"> that evolution is a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fact.” </span><span class="font5">In my opinion the words “idea” and “fact” do not go well together when speaking of an hypothesis which has not been proven. An idea may or may not be a fact, but an unproven theory certainly should not- be. referred to as a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I can readily understand after this second editorial why I did not receive a reply to some of my former correspondence. The editorial staff of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font5"> at least the one responsible for the recent editorial, is, no doubt, a dyed-in-the-wool evolutionist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How you can stand before the public and speak of evolution as a fact is beyond me. You may believe that it is, but neither you nor any one else has any proof of it at the present time, and in my humble opinion, never will. On the other hand, I believe in a great personal Creator and I believe that He did create the first pair as stated in Genesis. However, I could not stand before you and deciare that to be a fact, although I sincerely believe it in my own mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems to me to be a pity to subject thousands of unthinking people to such editorials as you write concerning evolution. If they all analyzed the situation and thought for themselves, it would be all right; but we both know that they do not and that the newspapers form their opinions for them. It is certainly regrettable that a newspaper should publish everything that it can lay its hands on in support of evolution and nothing in support of the special creation side of the story. Evidence in connection with the latter theory certainly is net lacking in the mind of any reasoning creature who is not blindly prejudiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very truly vours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">R. G, Eich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lost Name</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">ANKIND has lost a lot of things since Adam disobeyed God; and in view of the disrespect that it daily manifests toward its Creator, it is not a hit surprising that amongst the things that it has lost is the sacred name of God. Yes, God has a special personal name of his own. Ue confided it to man, and mankind lias mislaid, lost and forgotten it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “God”, of course, is not a proper name, but a more or less general term that means some one mighty or powerful. Those-who use the King' James Bible can readily prove this for themselves by referring to Exodus 15:11 and looking in the margin. There they will find that the word “god” merely means a ^'mightylone”. The word “lord” is used in much the fanif, way. and means simply one who has others. Both-these words are J|||||te|||||.ed to the Creator, for He, above</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Robert C. Boyd</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">all others, has power and authority. They are also applied to others. For example, in Isaiah 9:6 Jesus is called a God; in John 10:34 and 35 His followers are called gods, and in 2 Corinthians 4:4 the same term is applied to the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But apart from these general terms, God has a personal name of His own. Abraham never knew it, neither did Isaac nor Jacob, but God graciously revealed it to Moses. (Exodus 6:3) And long afterwards when Moses came to write the beginning of the Hebrew Bible he often used this sacred name when referring to the Lord; but to the- human family today, it is a secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hebrew language in which the Old Testament was written did not contain proper vowels like ours. It was a language of consonants. The Old Testament, therefore, was written with</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ consonants only, and before it could be read aloud the reader must needs have learned by heart the sounds of the 'words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This can be illustrated by writing down some familiar piece of scripture, omitting the vowels, such as :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HNE TH FTIIR ND TH MT.HR THT TH &quot;&nbsp;DS M B LNG PN TH LND.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any one familiar with the fifth commandment can readily read this, the consonants being sufficient to recall the words to the mind. But any one who did not know this text would not be able to make anything of it. .It was just like this with the Hebrew Bible. The writing gave them a rough idea of the meaning, but the sounds had to be learnt by heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So when. Moses, in writing the opening books of the Bible, came to the sacred name, he could write down only the consonants which it contained, that is, the Hebrew equivalents of the letters JIIVII. Moses knew how to say it, and would no doubt explain to his fellows what vowel sounds must be added to those four letters, and they in turn would pass on this knowledge from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At some period, however, the Jews came to believe that it was irreverent for them to utter this personal name of God’s; so whenever, in * reading<sup>-</sup> the Scriptures, they came to the word JH.VH, instead of saying it they said instead the word Aedonai, which means Lord. In this way the sound of the sacred name ceased to be pronounced; and as years, then centuries, went by it sank gradually into oblivion, and was forgotten. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' This practice of substituting either the word Lord or God for the divine name has been followed by the translators of most of the common versions of the Bible. This often makes it very difficult to discern whether a text refers to God himself or to Jesus, who also is often spoken of as Lord, sometimes as God. The King James ■ version, however, does not leave us entirely in the dark, for whenever it uses the Avoid Lord or God as a. substitute for the sacred name, it prints them in. small capital letters thus: God, Loed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jews, some time after their return from Babylon, set to work to revise their copies of the Scriptures and to remove any errors which ••• »;c.!rhafcejept in owing to continued copying and g ii|gg|||They also decided that they would cease <sup>!</sup> to trust to memory for the vowel sounds of their words, and therefore invented a number of signs which they could put underneath each consonant to indicate the vowel that should follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having a great veneration for the sacred writings, they would not actually alter any Avoid of 'which they disapproved. They let it stand, but wrote the correct word in the margin. Tliis was all right as far as it went, but something had to be done to attract the readers eye when it came to a word that was to be suppressed, so that he would know to look in the margin for the correction. So this is what they did: Having written in the margin the consonants of the word Avhich they Avished to be read, they then placed its vowels </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in the word which, they wished to be omitted.</span><span class="font7"> The result was the production of a non-sense Avoid in the text, which would immediately warn the reader to look in the margin for the proper word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To illustrate the process with English letters, let us suppose that Ave wished to suppress the ivord &quot;goats” and have the word “sheep” read in. its place. It Avould. work out like this: the word “goats” would appear in the text as GTS. In the-margin we Avould write SHP and transfer the two e’s to the consonants of the unwanted Avord, and Avould have GeeTS, thus making a word that the reader Avould easily recognize as wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As avg have said, the Jews latterly invariably read the Avoid Aedonai instead of the sacred name of God, and so this too was duly recorded in their revision. When they came to the letters JHVH they -wrote in the margin part of the ivord they Avished to be read, namely, Adni, and transferred the remaining vowels, e, o and a to the letters which they Avished to suppress, •• thus making JeHoVaH, a word which meant nothing to the Jewish reader Avho ivould then look to the margin and read Aedonai. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So all avg knoAV of the Lord’s name is that its consonants are JHVIL Nobody can say what the missing vowels are. Some think that they are “a” and “e” and that the J should be pronounced like “y”, and the V like “av” making the Lord’s name “Yahweh”. This may or may not be true; nobody really knows. But wet do know that “&quot;Jehovah” is almost certainly not the proper pronunciation of the name of God, because it is made up of the consonants of one Avord and the vowels of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt some day when men’s -hearts are turned again to God and His righteousness, He will once again confide to them His name. And meanwhile, though the w'ord Jehovah is an artificial word, we are, nevertheless, very glad to have it, for it has played its..part in the destruction of that foolish belief that. God and Jesus are the same person. It has also helped us to remember that God has a name especially his own, and has kept bright in our minds the knowledge that to us there is but one God and His glory He will not give to any other. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font7"> Is the world to continue always in one convulsion of trouble after another, as in past history?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> No. After the severe time of trouble just ahead God intends to bless the people with peace, prosperity, health, life and happiness under the kingdom of His dear Son Christ Jesus. In Micah4: 3,4 we read, “And he [Christ Jesus] shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pfuninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war., any more. But they shall sit ■ every man under his vine and under his fig Uee; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.” This will be the kingdom for which Jesus taught His followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” In Revelation 21:4,5 we read concerning that blessed time, “'And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, 1 make all things new. And he said unto me, Write; for these words are true and faithful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> If the ministers set themselves right relative to the hell question, will this not make the creeds of Christendom to correspond with the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> No. The&quot; hell question is only one doctrine out of many that must be corrected to correspond with the Bible. To be set right with the Bible the churches will have to stop teaching the immortality of the soul, when in Ezekiel 18:4 we read, “The soul that sinneth it shall die.” The preachers will have to stop preaching the trinity; they will have to stop making religion a commercial proposition; they will have to cease passing the collection box: they will have to cease preaching the boys into war when the occasion arises; they will have to cease preaching the ordination of ministers by man-made institutions; they will have to renounce theology; they will have to take up the Bible, learn the truth, and then honestly tell the people what is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Who wrote the oldest Bible that is i.n the world today ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The Bible was written by holy men of old, the prophets, apostles and early disciples of Jesus, as they were moved by the holy spirit or invisible power of God. Jehovah God was the author of the Bible, He designed the plan and the teachings of this book, and the writers were His amanuenses. In 2 Timothy 3:16 we read, “All scriptures are given by inspiration of God, and are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is but one Bible of holy -scriptures. There are, however, different versions and translations of the same Bible. Some have taken away or added to the original Bible, which was the inspired Word of God; but these alterations for the most part are readily detected by the Bible student in a comparison with the oldest known manuscripts, and by a comparison with the doctrines of the portions of which there can be no doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Who wrote the Bible that you quote ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> Holy men of old, the prophets, apostles and early disciples of Christ wrote the Bible which we quote. The version that is generally quoted is the King James. We also quote the Rotherham, Douay, and other versions, finding sometimes that relative to certain verses one translation is better than another.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">into war. America will do the same thing when war is declared. All these countries are making great preparations for war, and yet at the same time talking about peace. The last of these world powers described is the British Empire, the greatest the world has ever known. The rulers in America are allied with them, at least secretly if not openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The League of Nations is the outgrowth of an alliance between the nations of earth, and is described in the Scriptures as the “eighth kingdom”. The Lord then shows that His kingdom is represented by a stone which smites these world powers, and destroys them. Note this scripture: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That means that the God of heaven is setting up a righteous kingdom which will destroy these evil systems, and that these selfish men will have no part in it because God’s kingdom will be a righteous one and stand for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is only one class of rulers under the sun that go by the name of Christ and claim to be God’s people. That is “Christendom” or so-called “organized Christianity”. Now<sup>7</sup> note what the prophet says about these who are called by his name: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city [organization] which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Jer. 25: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the Lord intends to destroy these wicked systems that have oppressed the people is made clear by the words of the prophet: “Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold,</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font7">OTH of you are familiar with the perplexity and unrest and dissatisfaction amongst the peoples of earth. The people are familiar with the cruel,- harsh and unrighteous treatment they receive at the hands of the unholy alliance. That unholy alliance made up of Big Business, Professional Politicians, and Faithless Preachers has been deceiving the people and turning - their minds away from the true God and from the way of relief and blessings. God declared that the time would come when He would hear the cry of the peoples of earth and intervene in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having in mind these conditions, now take note of the scripture which reads: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fixe. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts,, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not re. si st you. Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.’’-—James 5:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is remarkable how accurately God through 'his prophet long ago described present conditions. He pointed out that in the last days of the present evil world, or the rule of unrighteousness, there would be perilous times, that men would be lovers of themselves more than ' levers of God, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. (2 Timothy 3:1-5) This, is exactly what we see today. Then He caused His prophet to give a description of the . great world powers in the order in which they have arisen and fallen. The Prophet Daniel in the . second chapter gives a prophetic descrip-tipn of these world powers. He foretold there would be an effort on the part of the rulers to amalgamate the common people in a great military machine. That is exactly what we see go-■ ing on now, because the countries of Europe have .conscription laws that force the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.”—Jeremiah 25: BO-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who now are the shepherds and the principal of their flocks ? The clergy, of course, are the shepherds; and the ‘'principal of their flocks” are the big men of power and influence who draw nigh unto the Lord with their lips while their hearts are far removed from the Lord, just as the prophet said it would he. (Isaiah 29:13) The Lord is going to spoil their fraudulent system, as the prophet says: “A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pastures.”—Jer. 25: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Peter gave a description of this unholy alliance which constitutes the present evil world; and lie says it shall pass away in a great time of trouble, and then adds: “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Petfir 3: 8-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rightoons Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Jesus stood before Pilate, charged with sedition and a violation of the espionage law of that part of the Devil's organization, he answered Pilate and said: “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should riot be delivered to the Jews: but now is mv kingdom not from hence.”—John 18:36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus He plainly says that the preachers do not tell the truth when they say the present evil, system is His kingdom. He taught His followers to pray and amongst other’ things to pray these words: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it. is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10) What kind of kingdom or government 'will that be? God’s prophet answers: “Ard t‘:u- roverninent shall be upon his [Christ ^8||fJg|iBi|lder: and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of •’A । the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”—Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font7"> But will not the Devil then interfere and deceive the- people? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Success:</span><span class="font7"> That question is answered in Revelation 20:1-3, wherein it is written that ’ during that period of Christ’s reign the Devil shall be bound that ‘he might not deceive the people any more’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font7"> I am beginning to see some light that the present system is evil and cruel and does not represent the Lord. May I ask, Are not all men created equal and should not all men have an equal and fair show?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Sttccess:</span><span class="font7"> The Scriptures declare that God “made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation”. (Acts 17: 26) The Americans, English, Germans, 'Italians, French, . Russians, all are human, beings; and there is no just cause or excuse why wars should be fomented between them and they be forced by their respective governing powers to kill each other. When the righteous government of the Lord is established at his second coming and kingdom, then there will be no more war. I | can not go fully into this mater here for want of time; but there is a book called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, </span><span class="font7">published by the International Bible Students Association, that fully explains this matter. I can briefly call your attention to some Scriptural proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s prophet shows that in the kingdom the. nations and peoples will say: “Come ye, and&quot; let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jaco'b: and he will teach us of his ways; . . . they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into priming-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Isaiah 2: 2-4; Micah 4:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No profiteer, politician or faithless preacher will then be able to harangue the people, misrepresent the facts, and lead them into war and other trouble. It is written: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail, shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.”—Isaiah 28:17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;........v</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lies that have been told the people will J bo swept away ; and their hiding places will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">^pneovered by Truth, which is represented by the waters. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Ix&gt;rd Jesus Christ, the invisible Buler of the new world, will be represented on earth -by his faithful - representatives, to wit, Abraham, Jacob, Isaiah, and the other faithful prophets, whom Cod will resurrect.—Hebrews, ll.th«hapter ; John 5 : 29 ; Psalm 45:16. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ shall be the invisible King and rule in righteousness. “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment?' (Isaiah 32:1) Then all the people will begin to learn what is right and true, as it is written: “With my soul have .1 desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.”—Isaiah 26: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mass of people want, to do right if they are permitted to do it; and the Lord’s righteous ■—-kingdom will show them the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No profiteers will be permitted to ply their unrighteous business amongst the people then; because it is written: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom].&quot; ( Isaiah 11:9) Nor shall the people labor in vain.—Isaiah 65: 23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Prosperity will not be only for a few, but .for all people. “'And in this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refi ned.” (Isaiah 25: 6) Then‘every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall make him afraid’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font7"> But how can the people enjoy these things if they still continue to be sick?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Success:</span><span class="font7"> But they will not continue to be sick.

<p><span class="font7">. The Downfall of Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Station WBBR, New York, by E. L. Beaulieu.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font7">YPOCRISY is so common a thing that it passes unnoticed. It is so familiar that no attention is paid to it, and so much expected that it is accepted as a matter of course. In fact, hypocrisy is so ever-present that often it is not recognized for what it is, and only its absence attracts attention. It is called by different names in different surroundings, but its essential characteristics do not change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amongst nations it is glorified as diplomacy, and relied upon to gain advantage. It is considered to be cleverness in a lawyer 'who will present only such part of the facts as appear to strengthen his own side of the case. “High-pressure” salesmanship employs it, setting forth benefits which the customer will not. realize. Professional gamblers cultivate it, and call it a “poker face”. The so-called “art of bluffing” is really hypocrisy; but in plain English, hypocrisy is- lying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What</span><span class="font7"> is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hypocrisy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">flMIE word “hypocrisy” means deceit; and is derived', from the Greek, where' it means stage; An actor im a play pretends an emotion not his own, and i plays a part which may be far different from -himself. The Greeks called him a hypocrite, or pretender; and this word thus comes down to 1 us as one who assumes to be -what he is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Individuals, groups, or nations, therefore, that pretend to be something they are not, that j state they have good motives when they have evil ones, that try to make others believe they ; are acting for the good of others or of all when J in reality they are acting in their own selfish : interests, are hypocrites, and they are practis- j ing hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hypocrisy and selfishness go hand in hand, j for hypocrisy is the cloak of selfishness. It preserves reputation by hiding evil motives, and , because it is deceit it helps to accomplish se.lf-,.. ish ends in the guise of doing particular or <sup>j </sup>general good. Since selfishness is the main-h spring of our present civilization, it will he <sup>: </sup>seen that hypocrisy is as widespread as civilization itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mankind is devoted to the principle that the® acquisition of glory, fame, .wealth, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">^is .success, and the means used io acquire these <sup>W</sup>is of secondary importance. When force can be</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">used, it is used. Witness the wars of history, the struggles between classes, and cutthroat - competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' But open warfare is not always practicable, -.—and often can not be used. Then comes the time</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for honeyed words and smooth-speeches. These abound at peace conferences and get-together meetings, but their purpose is the same as was ■the purpose of force, to accomplish selfish ends, this time by hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Present Civilization Hypocritical .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS not generally realized that our civilization is.a hypocritical one, and that hypocrisy taints every phase of it. Corruption, of course, ■ would be admitted. Dishonest politicians, grasping financiers, and preachers who should be in the real estate business are all about us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But I am not talking about the rottenness of-the worst elements of society. I would call attention to the character of our civilization at its best. The petty grafting of the politician, even .. though, he steals millions from his fellow citizens, is a small matter. If he gets eaught, he ......is-.......held up to the public scorn and may go to although he generally buys his way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">......- Far more important is the attitude of nations as they sit around the council table. Are the nations honest as they sit at Versailles, at</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">......Geneva, or at Havana? The statesmen of the nations are not corrupt in the ordinary way. They steal no money for themselves. But as the representatives of nations, do they not pretend to .false motives and utter hypocrisies ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hypocrisy of Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">......■ -TEHE great governments of earth exist pre</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">-®- sumably for the well-being of the people ......~gw©3?aed. -Vet every great nation of earth is</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">oppressive, some less so, some more so. Some oppress their colonies or dependent possessions for the benefit of the home populace. All, in some form or other, oppress the poorer classes for the .di reel or indirect benefit of the ruling cl</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">asses,</span><span class="font7"> the owning element as distinguished from the laboring element of society. In the present ’day of education and general knowl-can not be done openly. The result WiO^pcnsy^—....... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">4P The possessions of a country require protec</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tion, and the owners are ever on the lookout for ways of adding to them. The great nations of earth, therefore, keep standing armies and large navies to “preserve the peace”. “Preparedness” is never for war, but somehow it always results in war when the preparations are considered ample. Wars are always aggressive on at least one side, generally on both sides. The victor expects to. make large material gains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The instigators of wars as a rule, however, do not fight them. That disagreeable job is wished onto the common people. The common people must have a reason; so a reason is given them. In past ages they were promised plunder. But that is out of date. Nowadays the ruling classes want all the plunder themselves; so new reasons must be found to satisfy the common man. In the late World Wat lie fought for “principle”. In Central European countries the armies fought to “protect the fatherland”, and the Allies fought “to' save the world for democracy”. Both reasons were false ones. The nations which put them forth were hypocrites. The war was fought for empire and commerce, and the spoils of war are limited only by “ability to pay”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Financiers Too?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN we turn to the financial element of society, hypocrisy is still to be found. As just seen, the political element really exists for the protection of the financial element. But in some phases there exists a lack of harmony between the two. Some of the so-called “servants of the people” are really anxious to serve the people, and that won’t do at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Present-day society exists on the theory that capital is necessary for the well-being of the people, and that labor could not find employment without capital. Finding no employment, according to theory, labor would then starve to death. It is much easier to admit this contention than to argue against it. It really is an evasive one, for it does not get at the root of the abuses of capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The question is not whether capital shall exist, but who shall own it.' Real capital is the stored up product of labor. That being the case, it is self-evident who rightfully owns it; namely, the producers, of course, labor as a whole. Now the most perfect organization of all who work is the nation. Yet when government ownership of even the commonest public service is mentioned, some are ready to cry, &quot;Confiscation,” and to talk about &quot;property rights”. The purpose is to retain control of wealth. The attitude is one of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people must be fooled, they must be kept satisfied. Discontent is the worst foe of organized society. On the other hand, the satisfying of the people must not cost too much. What is to be done? The financier, and the politician as well, resorts to the age-old method. The people must be taught to be good. They must have religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And who should be examples of the people but the leaders themselves, who occupy promi-- nent seats in their favorite churches every Sunday morning? They have good reason for being there. It is good business, likewise good politics. And the Church does not offend them nor condemn them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Surely Not the Clergy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HIS brings us to the. third great ruling element, the ecclesiastical. Here we have an element supposedly devoted to the interests of righteousness and consecrated to the service of God by means of doing good to His creatures. The claim is made that the members of this class stand as the representatives of God on earth, for the purpose of teaching His principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since here we have the highest claims for righteousness, here we also have the most favorable field for hypocrisy. And what do we find? We find the politicians and the financiers' are not offended or condemned, because their preachers say only those things which the congregations want said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To condemn the wealthy would mean stopping the financial support of the church. And as the church is frequently in -polities and wants political favors in the way of certain laves, it will not do to offend the politicians either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their only course is to uphold the present order, to try to preserve our present civilization, which means that they must do their bit toward lulling the people to sleep and keeping them satisfied. Instead of representing God, they are really representing His enemies. God loves the human race, and, as we shall, shortly see, plans the destruction of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ecclesiastics, claiming to represent Him, love their positions more than they love God’s principles. They are like the Pharisees of old. &quot;They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and .lay them on men’s shoulders, . . . but all their works they do to be seen of men^ . . . [They] love the uppermost rooms at th* feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Master, Master.”—Matthew 23:4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus did not mince matters in His description of them. He said: &quot;Woe unto you, scribes _ and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.”—Matthew 23:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Clergy a Tool</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">npHAT the subservient clergy are merely the -L tool of high finance and hypocritical polities is proven not only by their every-day acts, but more particularly in their attitude in times of great public stress. Always are they on the side of “law and order”, that is to say, on the controlling, exploiting, and oppressing side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In every great war, the clergy are in the — fore, urging the men to fight: and they do this in utter disregard of the principles of Christ, the Prince of Peace, who taught His disciples, to -love one another and even their enemies. The specious excuses the clergy give for this unrighteous and hypocritical course are many and varied. They are all equally false and beside^ the point. The real reason is, they dare not^ oppose their allies, the politicians and financiers, for to do so would mean the loss of position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Additionally, the modernist clergy are convicted of having taught what they do not be- ~ lieve. Modernism as publicly taught is quite a recent thing. It is really only a few years old. .1 Twenty years ago it was unheard of. Did the A modernist clergy so recently change their views? No, not quite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While undoubtedly their views have undergone a progressive change, it has been only since the World War that they dared to air them. A few courageous men began to declare their real beliefs (or lack of beliefs), and all of 7 a sudden their number was legion. The most q of them had not dared to declare their lack of faith in old dogmas; they covered up their unbelief by giving moral lectures and inspirational sermons, but left doctrines strictly alone. ’ Some of them scarcely even believe in God, and '-■= certainly have but little use for His revealed Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their previous hypocrisy is now revealed? f</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">«</span><span class="font7">d their present degree of veracity we- can ly guess at. Truly, “ihis people draweth nigh unto me with their &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hornureth xae</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">with their lips;, but their heart is far from me.” —-Matthew 15: 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">iIF&amp;y </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Doeg God Permit Hypocrisy? ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">S WE see- the- three .. great ruling elements</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Uras arrayed in their true garments, not garments of righteousness but of hypocrisy, the scene is a dark one. We wonder why God permits it to exist, and when He will put a stop to it. We inquire what His purposes are, and whether He, as the only powerful friend of the oppressed people, will come to their rescue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God is not pleased with the situation, but permits it. Since Jehovah God is revealed in nature and by the Bible to be all-wise and allpowerful, to act always justly, and to be the very personification of love, the permission of ..^evil and the present hypocritical and iniquitous civilization must be in accordance with His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible reveals the reason. It is 'to give mankind an experience with the principles of unrighteousness in operation. Having done this, God wall give mankind the experience with ^he.......principles of righteousness in operation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">thus afford them the contrast. But even . this reason would not be sufficient if we did not know the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' God is not the author of evil, and did not ■ institute the present civilization even for the purpose of an object lesson. Man got himself into the situation by following the Devil, who isJ.-he founder of the present civilization, and the pattern of its rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Hypocrisy ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T.....ET us notice how this came about. Hypoc-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’tri risy results from the desire to control unrighteously. Since this can not be done openly in the face of superior force, it must be done under cover, and deceit is resorted to. Lucifer, a mighty angel of heaven, desired, to rule. He wanted dominion. Just as modern nations want dominion, and just as modern individuals want power, so Lucifer wanted them. He wanted to be a filter like God Himself. He said: “I will ■ exalt roy throne above the stars of God: . . . I willbelike the Most High.”—Isaiah 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a small beginning, he desired to get con-'the human race. His: only possible course was one of deception. He' deceived, and? overreached our first- parents. He appeared..as a serpent, which,.means deceiver, fie pretended to confer benefits, but in reality lie was man’s worst enemy.. He was the first hypocrite, for he appeared as a friend. “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.”—2 Cor. 11:14. ■ Satan, as Lucifer (which means shining one, morning-star), had bt'en a trusted servant of God. He betrayed his trust. Proud of heart, he became arrogant, disloyal, ungrateful. Seeking his own aggrandizement, lie became a hypocrite. His policy has won him temporary success, for he really is, as the Apostle Paul .calls him, “the god of this world.”—2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He is styled by the Prophet Isaiah, “the king of Babylon.” (Isaiah 14:4) The word “Babylon” is derived from Babel,-and means confusion. Literal Babylon fell long ago, but its king is still ruling on earth; for literal Babylon symbolized the hypocritical, three-headed, confused method of control which is still, in vogue, and without which present civilization could not exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having this thought in mind, the prophecies of Isaiah concerning the destruction of Babylon immediately become fraught with, new meaning. They take on present importance. They show something concerning the destruction of Babylon, and therefore of the present system of hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Not to Last For Ever</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">OME have thought our civilization will last for ever. Those who benefit by it hope for its continuance. But God has all the people in mind and will destroy it. Whatever the means used, “it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.” (Isaiah 13:6) Before considering its destruction,.however, let us notice something concerning the One whom Jehovah, is using to carry out His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lucifer, who became Satan, the Devil, was unfaithful. The same Bible that gives us the record of his unfaithfulness, also gives us an account of the loyalty of another great being. Another mighty angel of God was highly honored of Him, and this .one was truly grateful. He “did not meditate a usurpation to be like God, but divested himself, taking a bondman’s form, having been made in the likeness of men; and being in condition as a man, he<sub>:</sub> humbled himself, becoming obedient unfo 'death, even the death of the cross.”—Phil. 2:6-8, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This being, Jesus, the Anointed, having been tested to the uttermost and proven worthy, is entrusted with the outworking of God’s plan. “God also hath highly exalted&quot; him, and given him, &amp;&nbsp;name which is above every name: that at, the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in. heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;'and that every tongue</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the <sup>1</sup> hopeless. Yet God indicates that this will actu-glory of God the Father.”—Phil. 2:9-11. . ■ ally accomplish great, things. He speaks to His</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Be it noticed that the faithful and loyal Jesus received the very things Lucifer, the unfaithful, sought ! The one humbled himself, and was exalted; the other exalted himself, and will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah to Destroy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">ATAN’S present empire includes more than the visible earth. It includes also a spiritual realm, and therefore is styled in the Bible “heavens and earth”. The entire empire is to be destroyed. Thus in prophesying the destruction of Babylon, Jehovah causes His Prophet Isaiah to say: “Therefore, I will shake the &quot;&nbsp;heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.”—Isaiah 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, the literal heavens and earth are not meant. They were not destroyed when literal Babylon fell, and will not be destroyed when symbolic Babylon goes down. Merely the system of control by hypocrisy will be destroyed. It will be replaced by a new system, a new civilization altogether. “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apparently the new is to come into being -while the old is still in existence. In fact, one of the evidences by which we may know that the downfall of the old is due, is that we can see the new. The establishment of a new eiviliza* . tion, based on love and unselfishness, aecom^ panied by an entire absence of hypocrisy, is no slight task. If God were not its director, failure would certainly result. But He has promised, and has given an inkling of the method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The proclamation of the truth of God’s Word -may seem to be a thankless task. The preaching of the gospel and the insistence on the principles of brotherly love may seem useless and ally accomplish great, things. He speaks to His people and says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow -of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth.” (Isaiah 51: 16) This seemingly useless work, which Jesus commanded his disciples to do, and which has been so largely forgotten by his professed followers, is actually accomplishing God purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">People to Receive Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN the difficulties of Babylon become greater and the.people consequently more disgusted and sick of it, they will turn in increasing numbers from it. They will cease to j give it their support, and the Devil’s empire &lt;&nbsp;will fall in the day of the wrath of God Al^-mighty. The people will turn to God’s kingdom, His new heavens and new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, Isaiah makes this declaration: “Many people shall go and say, Come ye, let us go up to the mountain [kingdom] of the Lord. . . . and he will teach us his ways, and we will ■walk in his paths: . . . and they shall beat their ... swords into plowshares, and their spears into .»■ pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any -more.” (Isaiah 2:3,4) The fulfilment of this , prophecy involves the downfall of hypocrisy. ■ ■ God grant that it may soon be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A New Window Suggested</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE ‘Episcopal cathedral of St. John the</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE story of King Herod’s cruelty is not yet finished. When the wise men had gone away from Bethlehem, where they stayed only long enough to worship the young child Jesus, • .the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph, in a 'dream... The angel was sent to warn Joseph of ’the danger that was drawing near. He said, “Arise, and take the young child... and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I. bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child, to destroy him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So- Joseph and Mary made ready and journeyed into Egypt, taking with them the Babe Jesus. Thus we see how Jehovah. God protects those who are His. Because it was evident that the wise men who followed the light in the sky, did so through a real wish to worship the Son of God, Jehovah protected them also, by sending them home another way, that they might not come near the crafty Herod again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Herod had waited a long time for the return of the wise men, and had begun to believe they were not coming back, which proved to be the case, he cast about in his mind for some other way of locating the child Jesus so that the holy babe could be killed. Herod was very bad man indeed, and would do anything to gain his own ends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He figured out that the child Jesus must be under two years old, for he had very carefully inquired aH the particulars from the wise men. They had told Herod as nearly as possible of the exact time of Jesus’ birth, so the wicked Mng. had .a pretty good idea of how old a child ■Jesus-would be at that'time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">-v. So 4haL.bad King Herod’s -wicked plan was this. Since:he did not know the exact place in er near Bethlehem where Jesus was, he decided to .-kill every child in that place who was two</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">. years old or younger. As there are always plenty of murderers and cutthroats who like to obey such kings as Herod, he had no trouble in</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">- finding men to do this dirty piece of work. yWith-in -a short time, all the young children of Bethlehem, and even those who. lived in nearby towm.<sub>:</sub>.<sub>E</sub>.<sub>:</sub>and<sub>:</sub>.,villages, and in the country near Bethlehem, - had been, killed 'with the sharp swords of Herod’s wicked servants.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">_ You may be sure that many thousands of fathers and mothers were feeling sad and lone-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">this terrible- deed of King Herod’s. But the king 'did not care, not a bit. He no doubt thought that thus he had got rid of the baby who .the ..prophets had said would be King of the Jews some day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But you and I know that King Herod was wrong if he thought any such thing. The great Jehovah God was not going to allow any old butcher like King Herod to destroy His Son Jesus. So God had taken Jesus out of harm’s way by sending Him and Joseph and Mary .into Egypt before King Herod started his childkilling business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So the result of all that murder was simply that Herod did something that he will be very much ashamed of, and for which he will have to give an account to God, when he is brought back to life with the rest of Adam’s children in the resurrection-time, which is now dawning upon us. The holy child Jesus was safe and happy in Egypt with His mother and Joseph, and the Lord God Jehovah kept Him there until the wicked King Hei'od was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But when Herod had died, the angel of God again appeared to Joseph, teHing. him that it was now safe for Jesus to return to the land of His birth. Then Joseph and Mary took the little child Jesus and returned to Israel, and took up their ’dwelling in Nazareth, a city of Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the facts we have just learned it seems clear to us that Jehovah did not place the “star” in the sky to guide the wise men; for as soon as they had seen it and followed it to Bethlehem, he warned them to go home and not return unto Herod. In spite of all the pretty tales that are told of this “star”, and the many songs that have been written about it, and the pictures of it that have been painted, earnest students of God’s Word are led to the conclusion that the “star” was simply a light which Satan the Devil caused to appear before the eyes of the -wise men, to try to get them to tell Herod just where Jesus lay. When Jesus was born, there appeared, not a star, which means nothing of itself, but a real angel of God, who told the shepherds about Jesus, and who He was. The TRUTH, then, is that the “star” or light: which guided the wise men was the Devil’s first attempt to kill Jesus. There is no record that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any one</span><span class="font7"> besides the wise men saw that star. But </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> the shepherds round about the Hills of Bethlehem saw and heard the angel of the Lord.</span></p>

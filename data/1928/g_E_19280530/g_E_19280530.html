<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Pensions and. Old Age Insurance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">B</span><span class="font8">ETTER far a system of civilization that automatically operates so that those willing to work need never call for aid or feel the necessity of asking for pensions (charity) from anybody. But since there is so much of selfishness, oppression and injustice on the part of the strong it is not to bo wondered at that pensions occupy an ever larger place in ilie public mind. Pensions are for the weak and oppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Insurance for old age (any system by which the individual pays part of the cost of taking care of him in his old age) is quite a different matter. It is not a matter of charity. It is a business proposition, and should be so considered. Nevertheless the two subjects are woven together so closely that they can not well be treated separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The current idea of the British &quot;'dole'’, as it is improperly called, is grossly unjust to the self-respecting Britishers that years ago contributed a percentage of their wages to .build up the funds now being drawn upon for their needs. It is true that they are sometimes forced to overdraw their “dole” accounts, but they are expected to repay these sums, and do repay them. The “dole” is not charity; it is business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Britain’s stupendous losses in the World War Lave given her a great pension bnrdmi to carry. So closely are pensions figured that the amount of pension given for an amputated limb is graduated on the actual length, measured in inches, of the remaining stump. One person in every twenty-six in Great Britain is on the World War pension roll. The total of 1,665,000 such pensioners includes 489,500 men, 1,100 ■nurses and 482,000 widows and parents of men who died from war disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides the foregoing, .1,250,000 aged in Britain receive Old Age Contributory Pensions, paid regularly, through the post office, at the rate of $2.50 per week, regardless of any income they may receive from other sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all, fifteen million Britishers, men, women and children, one-third of the total population, are insured against the worst effects of ill health, unemployment, accident, old age and loss of their natural protectors. When first proposed the various laws which have brought this arrangement into existence were strongly denounced as socialistic, but they are now generally accepted as wise and needful under present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Canada, Australia, New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N CANADA, Australia and New Zealand, disabled soldiers and their dependents are being well taken care of. In British Columbia there is a maximum old age pension of $240 a year, reduced wdiere the applicant’s present assured income totals $125 a year and up. The Canadian Government pays half of this insurance, and British Columbia half. Beneficiaries must be British subjects who have resided in Canada twenty years, and in British Columbia live years. Other Canadian provinces are expected to follow<sup>7</sup> British Columbia’s example soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Australia, pensions are paid to invalids; They are paid to persons over sixteen years of age who are permanently incapacitated for work and became so incapacitated while in Australia. The rate is fixed at $260 per annum or less, as decided by the pension commissioner or his deputy. Old age pensions are granted upon application to persons sixty-five years of age who have lived in Australia twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In New<sup>7</sup> Zealand, old age pensions up to $215 a year are payable to all persons, except Asiatics, reaching sixty-five years of age, who have resided in New Zealand for twenty years and 'during the last five years of that time have lived a sober and reputable life.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">S47</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">In France and Germany, old age insurance is in effect. The pensioner is required to contribute during his productive years, the .government and the employer each contributing also to the pension fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Military Pensions in United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE War of the Revolution ended in 1784.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last pensioner of that war, a daughter of Jonathan Wooley, died in 1911, one hundred twenty-six years afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The War of 1812 was settled one hundred fifteen years ago, yet there are twenty widows of that war still on the pension roll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Less than two years ago there were still living nine soldiers of the Mexican War of 1848, and about a thousand widow's of Mexican War soldiers are receiving pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Seven billion dollars in pensions has been paid on. account of the Civil War, which ended fifty-three years ago; and there are still over 100,000 pensioned soldiers surviving, and over 220,000 widows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In addition to the foregoing, the United States Government is paying pensions to soldiers, widows, children, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters on account of Indian wars, the Spanish. War, the World War and the various private wars and bankers’ wars, until the total pension roll now numbers more than half a million. The average pension is about $500 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">As to Old Age Pensions '</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">NCE he is retired it is well-nigh impossible for an old man to obtain work of any kind; yet there are hosts of employers today that will not hire any man over forty-five years of age, so that more and more capable men. are being pressed into the ranks of those for whom some provision must be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Henry Ford believes in giving old men a chance. In one factory he has at work ninety-one men aged from seventy to eighty-eight years. A writer in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Dearborn Independent </span><span class="font8">says that the greatest dread of these men is not death, but the inability to continue their daily work. In this connection tW same writer says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every active, normal individual knows that the surest proof against minor ailments, mental and physical, is Work. It matters not in what field a person’s interest lies, be it the erection of skyscrapers, or the painting of china, let him rise at his- wonted hour of the morning, proceed to his place of business, and engage in his task; the neuralgia or indigestion which threatened on his arising will then either disappear or become endurable. In the same maimer, but to a vastly greater degree, this panacea, work, operates to delay the encroachment of old age. Remove it from a young man and he becomes prematurely old; remove it from an old man. and he becomes senile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a first point it would seem that, before we begin talking about old age pensions and charity we had better begin talking about justice. Not all men and women are prudent, to be sure; but given some better system than, the accursed interest system, there would be less need for any kind of charity. The poor-house is a poor substitute for justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Insurance actuaries predict the expectancy of .100 men. at age 25 to be as follows after forty years: 1 rich, 3 well to do, 8 comfortable, 32 dead (also comfortable) and 56 wholly or partly dependent upon others for support. Many aged people deprive themselves of heat and every possible comfort rather than betray their needs to others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Private or employer’s pensions are inadequate and impractical. Only four percent of male workers remain with the same employer twenty years or more, so that industrial pensions do not, as a rule, reach any considerable proportion of the population that must be cared for. Moreover, the courts have ruled that a corporation is not responsible for the payment of old age pensions when its pension fund is exhausted, regardless of any promises it may have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Some Old Age Pension Legislation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N THE United States, federal judges who have served ten years or more may retire at the age of seventy, and continue to draw full pay. Eight states have similar pension arrangements for their retired judges. But judges constitute but a small <sub>:</sub>prpppitioiKpf4he&gt;-two-- millions&lt; dependent aged thaU'biib.....tb-<sup>:</sup> be ■ OrecT fbri <sup>..</sup>......</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Six states have some other old age pension arrangements. In Montana and Nevada, persons over seventy years whose income does not exceed $300 a year are entitled to $25 a month. In Pennsylvania, a constitutional amendment that ’would permit old age pension legislation was defeated by the republican political mav chine, the State Manufacturers’ Association and the State Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The national government has an old age pension system, or rather an old age insurance system. Employes contribute 3|% of their-wages or salaries and may receive retirement pensions up to $1,000 a year. Before the adoption of this system it was not uncommon in Washington for employes of eighty to be driven to work, lifted out of their carriages and taken to their offices in wheel-chairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a general thing American business men think little of any plan of doing anything for the aged, preferring the well known and heartless American plan indicated by the motto, “Every man for himself, and the devil take the hindmost.'’ Not a pretty motto, but a. pretty good likeness of American opinion on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Some Private Old Age Pensions</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">INISTERS of various denominations are paid varying sums as old age pensions, on .t'iie principle that their parishioners did not give them enough to live on during their productive years and to save anything for the future. More and more ministers are seeing that the apostolic example of hustling for one's daily bread during the week makes the best basis for good sermons. A man who does not live as other men must, does not know how to advise other men how they should live. That is perfectly obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Carnegie has taken care of the retiring college professors. Indeed, the fund which he set aside for their maintenance has actually increased, so that there is now more to do with than there was in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Paris Municipal Council has unanimously adopted a proposal to create ten pensions a year for aged artists and writers who have done their work in .Paris. This is on the ground that, as a rule, life is hard for this highly valued class of workers. That is to say, they are highly valued by their fellows for what they have contributed to human happiness, but the valuation does not take the form of dollars and cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under our present civilization the highest rewards are often for those whose only service is to prey upon the weak and helpless, and to use political, financial and other great powers, especially ecclesiastical, for their own ends. “A better day is coining, a morning promised long.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Newfoundland as Seen By an Outsider </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By IL L. Stewart</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">npijERE have appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font8">from lime to time articles descriptive of other lands, so I thought it might be of interest to your readers to hoar some news from this somewhat remote eastern, island of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This rugged country, with a population of two hundred fifty-seven, thousand people, is unique in many ways. Being almost triangular in shape, and with its six thousand miles of coast-line, indented with hays reaching far inland, it lias often been called “The Fishermen's Paradise’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The irregularities of the coast are known as coves, arms, bights, tickles and harbors. The interior of the country is practically uninhabited, with the exception of a small portion of land adjacent to the railway lines. St. John’s is the chief and only city, having a population of some thirty-five thousand people. There are a few towns throughout the island each with several thousand residents. Outside of these the towns arc small and very scattered, generally extending over two or three miles along the water front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Transportation facilities are limited. One cross-country railway line extends from St. John’s to Port-Aux-Basque, a distance of five hundred forty-seven miles. One never gets dizzy because of the high rate of speed on this line. They make it in thirty hours, which is an average of eighteen miles per hour, including stops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Five other branch lines are operated and connect with the main line. The branch lines do not attain such a dangerous rate of speed. All the railway lines are of the narrow-guage type and a person feels cramped at times, especially when he thinks of some of the great fliers of Canada and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The railway service is augmented by five coastal steamers which ply weekly or bi-weekly supplying the needs of the outports. There is every accommodation on these boats. They are well adapted to the service in which they are engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The only street ear service on the island of Newfoundland is in St. John’s, and for a nickel these cars give one a ride with transfer privileges. However, there is another means of travel, which is of outstanding interest to the stranger here; that is, the dog teams. From two to twelve dogs are used in a team, according to the load. The dog teams have the right of way over all other traffic in the street, being similar in this respect to our fire brigades in America. These teams travel along at a high speed, the 'drivers shouting “Ganyway”, which means that pedestrians must give them the road or take the consequences, as the dogs see nothing but a square meal when their journey is ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Contrary to the general belief, the Newfoundland dogs are quiet and good-natured. In this respect they are very different from the dogs referred to by the Prophet Isaiah, of which canine stock we have a plentiful supply on hand and these are inclined to be vicious at times, especially if inroads are being made on the pastures which they guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While speaking of transportation we have on several occasions seen goats hauling loads of wood or water. It might not be amiss to mention that those goats are of the barnyard variety, and hence are of an amiable and obliging disposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ There are very few auto roads in the country, St. John’s and district being practically the only part of the island where autos can be used to advantage. There are fewer than two thousand cars licensed. The appearance of the motor boat has materially lessened the burden of the fishermen. Formerly they, as it were, “paddled their own canoe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The scenery in places is magnificent. Little lakes nestled in the hills and mountains present a qu|et and restful scene. The hills are invariably covered with evergreens. The country abounds with lakes and rivers, many of which could be harnessed to give unlimited power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The climate is rather changeable and very unpleasant. The spring and fall seasons are long and drawn out, while the winter and summer are short. There is usually a great fall of snow in the winter, sometimes reaching a depth of ten feet. The temperature rarely drops lower than fifteen below’ zero, and there is much damp, foggy weather for days at a time, also heavy rainfalls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chief industry of the country is cod fishing. The waters abound with cod. Herring, salmon and lobsttws are also obtained. The chief markets for their fish are Spain and England. The fishermen endure much hardship in the prosecution of their vocation. There are two whaling stations on the island and these provide interesting work for a number of the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The seal fishing is carried on with much enthusiasm during the open season, commencing March 13 and extending on into April. Usually six or seven large ships leave St. John’s for the ice where the seals are found. They return in about a month’s time loaded down with seal skins and fat. The departure of the sealing fleet from St. John’s is always hailed as a “red letter day”. Each ship usually obtains from ten to t-wenty thousand hides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are two pulp and paper mills operating day and night at the towns of Grand Falls and Corner Brook. These two mills give employment to some eight, thousand men. The paper for the printing of the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> is supplied by these mills. As to other resources there are minerals of great quality and quantity but they have not yet been developed to any great extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our Canadian and American friends could well benefit by the thrift of the people here. Each family has its own sheep, does its own spinning and knitting, and makes practically all its own clothing and shoes. The women are especially noted for the making of beautiful mats, which find ready sale among the tourists. The women are sticklers for headship and always recognize the “skipper” as the head of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people in general are very honest and. trustworthy; hence the policemen find very little to do in the way of preserving order. The country is liberally supplied with wild fruit, chief of which are blueberry, marshberry, partridgeberry and bakeapple. The larger fruits, oranges, apples, bananas, etc., have to be imported, but the prices are so exorbitant as to put these fruits quite out of reach of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The country is rough and rugged and has very little agricultural land; hence very few cattle are kept: the cows are chiefly of the tin can type. This causes a lack of the nourishing foods of butter and milk and, together -with the small quantity of fruits obtainable, results in a great deal of tuberculosis. The continual exposure of the folks to wet and cold in their open boats hastens them on to this dread disease. The death rate is high, as figures show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ One creditable feature in comieCtion therewith is the system whereby the sick are cared for. .A. doctor is stationed in a certain district and each family pays a stipulated sum (usually eight dollars per year) and is then entitled to free service, paying only for their drugs or medicine. One failing, however, we might mention with propriety, is the neglect of proper ventilation and sanitation about the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Following upon this subject of health and hygiene I might mention the fact that it does not cost as much here to die and be disposed of as it does in America. Very few outport residents require the services of an undertaker. Some of the neighbors usually make a casket for the deceased and have it neatly finished with the necessary material. The total cost of burial rarely exceeds twenty dollars, and often a very decent funeral is held at an expense of ten dollars. Inasmuch as “the dead know not anything”, no doubt they sleep just as well in a ten-dollar casket as in one which costs several hundred dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Education is provided by the leading religious organizations, each church controlling its own school instead of such schools being operated by the government. As a result the masses are kept in ignorance, which by no means results to the welfare of the country. Tn many districts the schools are closed during the winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As newspapers are scarce, only two dailies being printed in St. John's and about five other locals elsewhere, each post office provides a public news service which gives the outstanding news each day as received by wire from St. John's. This is recorded in a book which is open to the public in general. 'Telegrams of ton words can be sent anywhere in Newfoundland for twenty-five cents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Newfoundland is the smallest self-governing dominion of the British Empire. The affairs of the island are managed by a parliament of thirty-six members. If governed at the same ratio, Canada would have thirteen hundred members and the United States fifteen thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Harbour Grace, a town of some six thousand people, has come into prominence recently, it being the stopping-off place for trans-.Atlan.ti® flights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people here are inclined to be serious and spiritually-minded, which condition no doubt is induced by their hazartlous and dangerous calling. (We have just heard today that more Newfoundlanders are lying in the sea than in the land cemeteries.) This .religious inclination has made them an easy prey to the various church systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people are beginning to recognize the oppression under which they are laboring and in many cases welcome the message of deliverance and freedom, fllhis makes it difficult for the various systems to carry on, and the churches are resorting to all sorts of methods to raise money. The latest that has come to our attention is that the ladies make aprons to be sold at the church fair. In the pocket is found this verse:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Measure the waist line inch by inch</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And make sure the tape line does not pinch.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You are supposed to give one cent .for each inch of the waist line. How embarrassing to the stout ladies! Then, again, another method calls for one cent for each year of your life. How this shocks the modesty of our “old maids&quot;! One of the leading churches charges five cents a glass for the wine used at the communion table. Teas, bazaars, socials and other money-raising schemes are the order of the day. Of course this equally applies to all other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hell fire is still smouldering here in places, but in the past year some thousands of fire-extinguishers </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">{What Say the Scriptures About JI ell?)</span><span class="font8"> have been effectually used and have had a decidedly dampening effect on that teaching. The various churches control the cemeteries, as well as the schools, another wily method of keeping the people in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The .Newfoundlanders in general appreciate the message of the kingdom which is being put forth by the International Bible Students. This work is not accomplished without strong opposition from the religious leaders; nevertheless the message goes forth. In the past year over ten thousand printed sermons about the kingdom have been placed in the homes of the people. Also lectures have been given in most of the towns. At these meetings in almost every instance we had capacity houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Iii concluding let me say that our hearts rejoice in the prospect of that grand and glorious kingdom soon to be established — a kingdom ’ which shall he a boon not only to Newfoundland but to the whole world. The people of this country (with very few exceptions) have shown us much kindness and hospitality and will, without doubt, receive a rich recompense from Him who says, ‘'Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Men and Monkeys </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By H. D. McIntyre and H. Anthony </span><span class="font5">[Reprinted from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The GMen Age,</span><span class="font5"> Number 95, by request]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8"> TRIBE of monkeys met one day To settle some disputes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That they had had among themselves Concerning men and brutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And as I chanced to pass that way,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I felt an inclination</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To hear what they might have to say; And had an invitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I’ve seen men swear and drink and fight And tear their brother's eyes;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’ve heard them tell as solemn truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most blasphemous lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I’ve heard them say a thousand things Too foolish to bo- told;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But yet they claim to be as wise As Solomon of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To take a seat among the rest, And make myself at home</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among my own relations—apes That in the forest roam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Said I to one: “There’s some mistake;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Explain it, if you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you me for a monkey take,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Or call yourself a man!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Said he: &quot;My friend, there’s no mistake, So far as we’re concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This question rose among you men, And men that you called learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;And tliis is why we’ve met today</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To air this weighty matter;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So hear what we will have to say, And listen to our chatter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems these monkeys all have heard Of Darwin’s famous plan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That from their ancient sires had sprung The present race of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They sent a delegation out</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To learn more of this race;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They found a slight resemblance, But only in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One monkey rose and told the rest What he had learned of man;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'And if my .friends all think it best, I’ll tell it o’er again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Said he: “I’ve traveled far and wide;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’ve seen wise men and fools;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’ve seen them in the churches pray;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’ve seen them in the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;A king, though he be born a fool</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Or stupid as an ass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will find his most obedient tool Among the working class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The working man will pass resolves</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To put oppression down,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yet crawl and cringe before a king Because he wears a crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They work and sweat from morn ’til night, Until they fill their graves,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To feed a pack of titled thrones Who use them as their slaves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another monkey took the lloor. And thus addressed the crowd:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;If Darwin’s story be correct, You need not feel so proud</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;To learn that men were monkeys once,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And act like willing asses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To carry burdens all their lives, As do the working classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Disgusted with the rule of kings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And with their cringing tool,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I came to free America, Where boasted freemen rule;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Where Yankee Doodles fought and bled,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To free themselves from kings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But there I found that weakling sons Were ruled by thieves and rings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;When kings and knaves get up a war To settle their disputes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The working men will rush pelhnellj,-And play the human brutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' “The knaves will then divide the gold, The fools divide the lead;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'And then they shoot each other down, ’Til half the fools are dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The other half will then go home<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And work like willing slaves,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And help to pay the war debt off, And then fill pauper graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When working men were in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And fighting brave and bold,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Wall-Street thieves, like fiends of hell, Were reveling in gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Men boast of their religion. Men boast of their free schools;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But if wo monkeys acted so, They’d say that we were fools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And I would say the same myself, • In fact, I’d hide my face;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If rvc should ever act like man, I’d cease to own my race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I feel ashamed to tell you how The common people act,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I scarcely would believe myself, Until I proved the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They spin and weave and make fine things For lazy drones to wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They plow and sow and reap and mow, And get Hie smallest share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And when they fill the land with wealth, With scarcely room for more,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The drones will take and pile it up, And keep.it all in store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The workmen stand around and gasp, And raise the silly cry,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;'Because we have produced so much, We have to starve and died</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But those who never toil and spin Have plenty, and to spare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They seem to claim a lawful right To other people’s share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“&quot;Where'er I went, the working men Ne’er stood compact together,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, ruled by knaves and party droves, Made faces at each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When Providence is kind to apes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And gives abundant fruits,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">AVe don't go ’round and cry ‘Hard Times’, As do the human brutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We go to work as monkeys should,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And gather in our store,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And each one gets just what he’s earned, And does not ask for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But man has quite reversed our plan:' They plunder one another;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each one is stealing all he can, And brother robbing brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And then they go to church and pray</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">But, knowing that they told the truth, Felt quite a little flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now, my friends, the story ends. This moral fits Hie ease:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font8"> The priests and ministers preach of a lake of fire. If it be so, how can the Bible say that death will be cast into it! Please explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> “The lake of fire” in the Bible is a symbol of destruction; and it is a fit picture of the second death, from which there will be no recovery. The Bible specifically states, in Revelation 21:4, that a time is coming when there will be no more death. The Bible word “hell” means the condition of the dead, the condition of oblivion. What then does Revelation 20:14 mean ? It states, “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.” It means that a time is coming when death and the grave will be blotted out. To be “cast into the lake of fire” means to be destroyed. And in accordance with this thought the Revelator states that this is the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Relative to the priests and clergymen who teach eternal torment we can say this: They don’t know’ what they are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> What does the Bible mean by the first resurrection I Is there another resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Yes; there is another resurrection. The Bible clearly holds that the first ones to be awakened from the tomb by Christ Jesus at His second advent are His faithful followers who have died. After the total number of Christ’s faithful followers, 144,000, who will constitute the true church, have been resurrected, then the general awakening of the world of mankind will take place. It must be remembered that Christ Jesus and His faithful followers will constitute the reigning element of the kingdom; they will have a spiritual resurrection. The world of mankind in general will come forth in a fleshly awakening. This wall include all of the heathen who have not as yet been on trial. In Acts 24:15 we read, “'There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.” The heathen individual coming forth from the tomb will be' enlightened with the truth of the Lord. If he is obedient, he will be granted everlasting life on earth. The words found in Ezekiel 18: 21 will apply in the kingdom. We read, “But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Was the bread which Jesus broke and the wine which He told His disciples to drink, a part of His body or blood, or did they </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">represent</span><span class="font8"> His body and blood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The correct answer may be arrived at by the answer to this question: Was the body of Jesus, which was a part of Jesus, divided betwmen the plate and Himself? Was the blood of Jesus on that occasion divided between His own vessels and the cup? You will answer, ‘No, of course not.’ You are right, and any other conclusion would be unreasonable and ridiculous. The proper answer to the question, therefore, is that the bread and wine represented the body and blood of Jesus in symbol. Such expressions were frequently made by the Master. In Matthew 5:13 Jesus said concerning His disciples, “Ye are the salt of the earth.” This did not mean that His disciples were literal salt. The Bible also refers to the followers of Jesus who are faithful, as wheat. This does not mean that His disciples are literal wheat that grow’s in the field. Every rational mind will agree that men can not be literal salt and literal wheat; neither can the body of Jesus be literal bread in the platter or literal wine in the cup. The bread and wine were fit representations of His body and blood, respectively.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Direcfly across the street from the Capitol the Methodists have a building which cost them $750,000, in which they undertake to look after ' the “public morals” of the people of the United <sup>: </sup>States.

<p><span class="font8">Business is represented by four senators and four congressmen. Besides these, there are one major-general of the United States Army, a judge, and several lawyers. The board serves as a private government, a go-between or mediator between the people and the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Its duties consist in communicating regularly with 20,000 Methodist ministers, and filling them with propaganda to suit its ends. These ministers, in turn, keep the board supplied with “’public opinion”, which has been locally manufactured to back up this propaganda. Armed with its “public opinion”, thus deviously secured, the board demands legislation to suit. A nicer combination of church and state could hardly be devised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Northeast of the Capitol, in the Bliss Building, is the Washington home of the Anti-Saloon League, concerning which Judge Lamar wrote: “'Wayne B. Wheeler, General Counsel of the Anti-Saloon League, exercises today a greater power over the destinies of this nation than any Catholic cardinal assigned to a royal European court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides these, two quasi-religious organizations, the Lord’s Day Alliance and the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, are also sticking their probosces deeply into public affairs, busily engaged in minding businesses which nobody asked them to mind, and zealously occupied in tearing down the structure of religious liberty and separation of church and state upon which the government of this country was founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T IS a familiar sight in the West to see Christians turn against the simple precepts of Christ, and either resort to arms or break forth in paeans of praise of those who do. And now the Chinese Christians are following the example of their Western brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many Chinese have turned from ancestor worship and other pagan religions in response to the urgings of the missionaries that Christ was a rebel of His own times, that He stood for progress, and that it is because He was progressive that the Western nations have become foremost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the time has come when the whole of China is in revolt. The Chinese say, so far as they have knowledge of Christ, that if He lived in China He would be on the side of the Chinese in their aspirations for national liberty and freedom from the yoke of the Westerners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Acting upon this simple reasoning the Chinese Christian Association of Wuchang, Hankow and Hanyang has met and adopted resolutions unqualifiedly siding w i t h Chinese nationalism, and have urged such missionaries as love their own lands more than they love Christ to leave the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Students of the situation, who are on the ground, say that the native Christians are in an even more difficult situation than the missionaries, because the latter can leave for home, while the native convert, unless he turns nationalist, is almost sure to be driven from what borne he may have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gradually the duplicity of “organized Christianity” is coming to bight. It is easy to see that commercial or political expediency is really its first principle of action.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8"> LITTLE while ago the gas company conceived the brilliant idea of making a monthly service charge of 75c to every customer, with a graduated series of charges thereafter, depending upon the amount of gas used. Thus the little user, the poor man, pays for his own gas and a part of the gas used by the rich man, - demands that the poor man maintain a balance of $200, else it will be compelled to make a service charge of $1 a month. The reasons are the same: namely, that the small account does not pay, and therefore it must be made to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was not long afterward (we speak prophetically) before the poor man had to pay a service charge of $1 monthly in order to get any milk, and, of course, had to pay higher prices for the milk itself, because of the superior and therefore unprofitable sendee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then it got fairly well started, and before long he was paying service charges for his morning newspaper, service charges to his grocer, service charges to his butcher and service charges to the man that sold him</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">overalls. (Overalls were all s”— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he could afford to buy, by</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">this time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were service charges to the water company, service charges to the electric light company, service charges to the ice company, service charges to the coal company and to the street car company. All were ’willing to serve, and lauded their excellent service, but they insisted on a flat service charge of $1 a month in addition to the cost of what was purchased or they would not sell a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The railroad demanded another service Q charge, so did the express company and the &quot;&nbsp;post office. The laundry took a whack at him, and so did the druggist, and he could not get a pint of gasoline ivitbout the usual monthly service charge of $1 straing him in the face. In the midst of the excitement the landlord soaked him for another $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The poor man became discouraged and went to the priest to confess, but the holy father had added on another $1. because always ready to serve. Then word was passed down the line that hereafter the bishop would not “bish” without a service charge, nor the archbishop “arch”, nor the cardinal “card”, nor the pope “'Peter”, whereupon the poor man took sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The doctor came and looked at him and said, ‘Nothing doing unless you put up the usual preliminary service charge of $1, in addition to the regular fees.’ But by this time the poor man had run out of dollars, so he died of fright as to what would become of him. The undertaker came and looked at him and told the bereaved family that he could not start work without their putting up $1 as service charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They took the man to the cemetery, but they refused to let him in without a service charge. After some delay he wound up in front of the pearly gates, but “St. Peter’ confronted him with a yellow sign which at first he thought was a quarantine advertisement but soon found was the old familiar service charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sadly he retraced his steps to the elevator and pressed the buzzer for the dowmvard trip.</span></p>

True, radio is not at present so much an educational factor as an entertainer; but as Messiah’s kingdom increases its power, the control by selfish commercial interests will be supplanted by more altruistic concerns. There is no doubt that radiocasting has been introduced into men’s lives in order that ‘the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth’ and that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness unto all nations”.—Isaiah 11:9; Matthew 24:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">E¥OND question this type of receiver is by far the most selective. It is accomplished by having a filter system made up of radio frequency transformers the band-pass of which is limited to 10,000 cycles at a long wave length. This wave being, much higher than the broadcast wave, special transformers are required and exactly matched. An extra tube is required which furnishes a wave which, added to the incoming wave, just produces a wave that the filter is peaked at. This receiver operates on this wave only, and is therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">practically one hundred per cent efficient. This ?t|||Bif Ificqiter Is us||l|sekpensive, and operat-??^? ing cost is higher, since eight or ten tubes are used. It must be remembered, however, that this will not separate stations on the same wave..............</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE Teapot Dome still boils. Great statesmen appear one after the other and under solemn oath tell the biggest kind of lies and get caught, at it, but nothing is done. The worst- of it is that the common people are noAv convinced that most of these great statesmen knew all about the Teapot Dome steal long before it was engineered and that in their solemn councils have done everything they could to keep the facts from coming to light. Fine business! One of these great men a few’ years ago was put at the head of a giant corporation so that he might make its respectability apparent to all men. He lias just been caught in the lie, told in 1924, that the Sinclair contribution to wipe out the deficit of the Harding campaign avqs only $75,000, whereas all men now- know that it was $160,000. We must respect these men; but why we must, except that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font8"> themselves demand it, is a thing unknoAvn. As the notorious facts of corruption come more and more to light all can see why it was that Mr. Coolidge did not “choose to run” for another term. The surprising thing is that neither he nor any of his associates have done anything worth while to uncover this corruption, but have tried to compel silence regarding it.</span></p>

A few courageous men, convinced of their truth, are following the trai 1 pointed out by the articles of Doctor Betts and Doctor Held. One of these is George Starr White, health editor of the Los Angeles </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated News.</span><span class="font8"> In a note to Doctor Betts, Mr. White says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A man was just in to tliank me for what I had done for his mother and for him. He said he read my article re aluminum in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News.</span><span class="font8"> He cut the article out and mailed it hack East to his mother, who had been told her finger would have to be amputated, for it had a big swelling on it that no doctor could remove by all methods known. Had been growing for two years. She discarded all aluminum, at once and within four weeks the growth is all gone. How is that for helping the public!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What’s in a Name </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By James Larkin Pearson</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE to bo a good deal in a name, when it comes to picking presidents of the United States. In looking over the list of presidents from Washington to the present, one is struck by the almost entire absence of the more common family names. Just five presidents have borne what you might call common names: The two Adamses, Jackson, Johnson, and Wilson. All the rest have been scarce or unusual names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the army draft in 1917 there were tens of thousands of Smiths, and in any city directory you will find pages and pages of that name. But even with so many thousand chances to rise to the presidency, no member of that numerous family has ever got there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Go out into the street of any town or city and throw a stone, and the chances are you will hit a Smith, a Jones, a Brown or a Williams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, plentiful as these name are, not one of them, has ever reached the White House. According to the law of averages there ought to have been more of these names in the White House than of any others. But there have been exactly none. Whatever fate or destiny has the job of picking presidents, it has certainly passed over the common names and picked the odd and unusual ones. Look at such names as Madison, Monroe, Van Buren, Tyler, Polk, Fillmore, Buchanan, Arthur, McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft. Only a few of them in the country, and yet they have each furnished a president; while the great armies of the Smiths, Joneses, Browns and Williamses have not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And isn’t that another indication that Al Smith’s chance of becoming president is rather slim® To say nothing of his®wetness or of his religious affiliation, he has the wrong name </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE are very few statesmen left on the earth. Most men in public life are professional politicians. Politics is their business. A great number of them are either directly or indirectly in the pay of some big financial institution. High finance sees to it that all the leading political parties nominate for office men that can be influenced by the corporations. When the election is held, no matter who loses, the corporations win and the people pay the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then a proposed law comes before the legislative body for enactment. If it is in the interest of high finance, it is enacted with little difficulty. But if the enactment of the law would work to the interest of the general public and against the predatory wealth, it has little chance to become a law. Here is a sample:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently a bill was pending before the United States Congress, the purpose of which was to provide for the construction of a great dam across a river, which, is known as the Boulder Dam. The dam would make possible the reclamation and cultivation of large areas of desert land, which would be in the interest of the tillers of the soil. A powerful corporation was opposed to the building of it because that dam would conflict with some of its interests. One Josiah T. Newcomb was general counselor for that corporation. Actively engaged in opposing the enactment of the Boulder Dam bill he boast-ingly said: &quot;I represent an investment of nine billion dollars, and we do not propose to let the government enter the power business at Boulder Dam. The bill has no chance to pass. It will not pass. If it changes it can. go through at this session.'&quot;’ It did not become a law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This meant that 120 million American people could not have their representatives in Congress enact a beneficial law because one gigantic financial institution did not want it enacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Federal Trade Commission of the United States issued </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> statement to the effect that in 1922 six companies controlled one-third of America’s water power; eight companies controlled three-fourths of the anthracite coal reserve ; and two companies controlled over half of the iron ore reserve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These gig’antie corporations could use their powers for the general welfare-of the public, but they do not. They use their powers self-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ishly and to debauch and corrupt the law-making and law-enforcement bodies of the land. Occasionally a man in politics becomes so thoroughly disgusted with the wickedness of this organized power that he comes forth with a statement of facts to the people. Here is a sample:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Former Governor Pinchot of Pennsylvania said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one who studies the electrical developments already achieved and those planned for the immediate future can doubt that a unified electrical monoply extending into every part of this nation is inevitable in the very near future. The question before us is not whether there shall be such </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> monoply. That we can not prevent. The question is whether we shall regulato it or whether it shall regulate us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Justice Ford, of New York, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In my experience I have found the public service corporations-, the street railroads, the telephone, the lighting companies in particular, to bs the most prolific source of political corruption in the state. They more directly depend upon governmental favors than any others, and indeed the profits of their business flow from the special privileges which they procure and hold from the government, both state and municipal. In my day at Albany these corporations plied their nefarious business of corrupting the people’s representatives so openly that a blind deaf-mute could learn what was going on. Not that legal evidence could be found against them. They were too shrewd for that. But every public man there was morally certain as to what was going on, and in private conversation it was freely talked about. These public service corporations pollute the very fountains of public virtue; they debauch our public servants; they subsidize party organizations for their own purposes. All the powers of government are subverted to their base ends; and government of the people, by the people, for the people, is made a mockery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even the courts are corrupted by Big Business. When Big Business is pitted against the common people, the people have no show in the courts. The words of Mr. Samuel Untermycr are pertinent on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nowhere in our social fabric is the discrimination between the rich and the poor so emphasized to the average citizen as at the bar of justice. Nowhere should it be less. . . . Money secures the ablest and most adroit counsel. . . . Evidence can be gathered from every source. The poor must be content to forego all these ■ advantages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Make IVar</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE power to make war is lodged with the political wing of the government, but the real power is exercised by big finance. War makes it necessary for governments to issue bonds, to be bought by those -who have money. Profiteers decide that it would be to their advantage to have the country go to war. They own and control the largest newspapers. A systematic campaign of propaganda is begun and carried on by their press. Step by ' step these papers recount the numerous insults to which the people of the country have been subjected, and say that these should be resented by force of arms. Strong appeals are made to the patriotism of the people in order to elicit their support. War is declared by the law-making body yielding to the influence of selfish interests apparently supported by the people. The politicians quickly pass emergency laws which compel every one of a certain age to render military service. The war is on, and the people are urged to buy the bonds to carry on the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the clergy are called into action. They become the spellbinders. They use their pulpits to harangue the people and urge them to go to war. When some of these preachers go with an army as “spiritual advisers”, they always manage to remain at a safe distance in the rear. They work hand in glove with their allies, Big Business and Big Politicians. They work up great excitement amongst the people, and then they are ready to go to any extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The young men are promised better jobs when they return from the war. They' are told that the war will make the world safe for democracy and that they will cover themselves with everlasting glory. They are told that if they die on the battle-field their names will be inscribed upon tablets of honor and their souls elevated to the highest place in the universe. After the war is over, the millions of youth fill untimely graves; millions of others are marred for life. And so far as the survivors are concerned, the prewar pledges are forgotten; and the ex-soldier is pushed aside with contempt. The war results in millions of widows and orphans who in great grief struggle along for existence. It is soon found that the war has greatly increased the tax burdens of the people. It results also in a new crop of avaricious men who have learned to defraud and plunder the people. No good has resulted. The everlasting covenant.that God made for the preservation of haman life is violated.—Isa. 24:1-6; Gen. 9:4-9»</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Unholy Alliance</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TT IS the three elements, namely, High Fi--$■ nance. Professional Politicians, and Faithless Clergy, that rule the people. When the war is over, together they continue to harangue the people saying, &quot;In time of peace prepare for war. Give us more money to carry on our preparations. Patriotically support us, because we are the on.es qualified to rule. Hear what we say, because we are the representatives of God on earth.'’ The Federal Council of Churches issued a proclamation following the World War, stating, &quot;The League of Nations is the political expression of God's kingdom on earth.” It is well known that the League of nations was proposed and carried into operation by financiers and politicians and fully supported by the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You wonder vdiy attention is called to these tilings. Is it possible to reform these three elements and make the country better by exposing them? No; not that. The purpose is to show that the clergymen are sailing under false colors and misleading the people; to show them that the clergymen are unsafe guides; to show the necessity of a power greater than that of selfish men to bring the people relief and prosperity. Attention is called to the wickedness of Big Finance and Big Politicians not merely to denounce them, and with no hope of reforming them, but. to show the class of men with whom the clergymen have entered into an alliance. Men are judged by the company that they keep. The fact that they deny the Bible and join hands with an oppressive class shows that the clergymen are practising a fraud upon the people, and that so-called organized Christianity is a fraud and a snare. The people must see that their relief can not come from such an unholy alliance; and seeing this, they will look to the proper source from which relief and prosperity will come. It is God’s due time for the people to understand the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Unseen Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T MUST be apparent to any thoughtful person that back of the unholy alliance there is an unseen and evil power which has organfeed, operates and controls it. It is easy to be seen that it is fraudulent, that it is cruel and harsh, and oppressive. Who, then, is the mastermind that is responsible for the wicked and oppressive so-called Christian organization on</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">that old Serpent, the Devil and god of this world, who has formed and operates the unholy alliance of Big Business, Big Politicians, and Big Preachers, and operates it under the title and name of ‘'organized Christianity”. The purpose is to control the people and keep them in subjection to the Devil, and to torn their minds away from the true God. This unholy alliance rides upon the people, draws its substance from the people, and rules the people by fraud arid coercion. The Pharisees, who constituted the clergy of the Jews, were controlled by the Devil, as Jesus stated. (John 8:4345) Present-day clergy are the modern Pharisees. Jesus recognized Satan the Devil as the prince of this world. (Matthew 4:8; John 1.2: 31) Paul</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“(Satan] the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, kst the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Perfect love means the perfect expression of unselfishness. You can plainly: see that Big Business, Professional Politicians and Faithless Preachers are entirely selfish in their efforts to keep the people under control. God could not approve anything that is wrong. God has permitted Satan and his agencies to control the nations of the earth, and evil to go on, in this, that he has not stopped it. He has been-permitting the people to learn a great lesson, namely, that do follow wrong-doing leads to unhappiness and death. He is teaching: them that he is the only true God' and the Source of life and blessings; and when they learn this, they will appreciate the blessings which they may receive. He declares his purpose to stop wickedness and establish righteousness for the benefit of mankind. Experience is the best way to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font8"> 1 can see that the invisible power that controls this world is extremely selfish and evil.

<p><span class="font8">God’s command, was offering Isaac his only son as a sacrifice. God permitted the picture to be made, ami then stopped Abraham’s action. God was there making a great picture which foreshadowed the means whereby he would bring</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">................</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By inheritance all men came under the condemnation. (Bomans 5:12) The only way redemption could be had was tjy tl-=e death of another perfect man. The Scriptures declare that Jesus was made a man and dwelt anumgst men that he might redeem men from the curse of sin and death. The love of God made this provision, as it is written: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever bolicveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—-John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■<sup>:</sup> -This • being<sup>:</sup> the way of -redemption, it is the most natural thing to expect the Devil to inculcate into the minds of his representatives, and through them to teach the people, the doctrine that there is no value in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The death and resurrection of Jesus mad© it possible for men to have everlasting life, because Jesus came that the people might have life. (John 10:10) By the grace of God he tasted death for every man. (Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:3-6) The Scriptures declare that his death and resurrection are a guarantee that in God’s due time all men shall have a fair trial for life. The Scriptures plainly state that God has appointed a day for this very purpose. (Acts 17:31) That day must come, and it is now at hand. From the time of his resurrection until his second coming and kingdom, God has had the truth preached in the world that a few men might accept it by faith and follow in Christ’s footsteps and be witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God has not interfered with Satan’s wicked rule during that period of time. Satan, knowing that God had promised to bring blessings to the people through Christ, knew that true Christianity would be the very thing that the people would want to learn. Therefore Satan set about to organize a false system which he has called “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”; and this he did for the purpose of deceiving the people. You can see that there is a true Christianity, and a false system which names itself Christianity and which is extremely selfish and wicked. You can see that such wicked system is the work of the Devil, and not the work of the Lord. The Scriptures also declare God’s purpose through Christ to destroy the work of the Devil, as it is written: “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”—1 John 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jf-r. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Adversity:</span><span class="font8"> Does that mean, then, that the so-called Christianity of Christendom is the Devil’s instrument, and it. is going to.be de' stroyed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Success:</span><span class="font8"> That is exactly right. With the destruction of that evil system the people will be completely delivered. They will learn the truth, learn that Jehovah God is their great Benefactor, that Jesus is their Redeemer and Deliverer; and they will enter upon the way of life and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God caused a great picture to be made foreshadowing the fall of Christendom. That was long centuries ago. The Israelites were God’s chosen people; and they were domiciled in the land of Egypt, where the ruler of Egypt greatly oppressed them. They cried unto God, and God heard their cries and. sent Moses to Egypt to act as their deliverer. (Exodus 3:2-8) Then God delivered his chosen people from Egypt by leading them safely across the Red Sea, and at the same time destroying the Egyptian army and rulers. In that picture Egypt represented the Devil’s organization; and Pharaoh the king represented the Devil himself. The Israelites pictured or represented the peoples who desire to know and to do God’s will. Moses, who acted as the deliverer, represented Christ, the great Savior and Deliverer of the peoples of earth. The overthrow of the Egyptians represented the fall of the Devil’s organization, which includes “Christendom” or so-called “organized Christianity”.

<p><span class="font8">He was paying an afternoon call in. London, and a lady present offered him a lift in her brougham. The two were seated in the vehicle chatting, the lady’s little boy leaning against his mother’s knee, and regarding Darwin with, all the earnestness of a lad of six.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Popular Fallacies Concerning the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Tir.dioci.et irotn Stiitb-;; WIIBII. Xw York, by It. I’. E«ib&gt;r.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A FALLACY is defined as something that de-A reives the inind or the eye. It is deception. There are four kinds of fallacies c-r deceptions which relate to the Bible, all of which are very popular because nearly everybody is familiar with them and because they are used as the basis of many false conceptions of God’s plan and His truth. These deceptions are so popular that any one- who dares to expose them or call attention to them is at once branded as an infidel, and ofttimes ostracized and persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These four varieties of deceptions, or fallacies. are, in their order: first, snme quotations that are supposed to be found in the Bible but are not found there; second, some doctrines that arc supposed to be supported by Scripture, hut are not supported by a single Bible text: third, certain texts that are found in the Bible but do not belong there and are no part of the Bible, but were additions to the Scriptures, made during the dark ages; and fourth, the mistranslation of certain words which were made to mean, in the English translation, what they did not moan in the original language. The last three of these fallacies are specially fruitful of many misunderstandings of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before proceeding with my argument, it might be well to ask, Why are these deceptions found in the Bible? Who was instrumental in pulling them there? and what was the reason for so doing? Jt slum Id be apparent that any one who would knowingly place them in the Bible must of necessity bo an enemy of God. and enemy of the troth, and an ouemy of righteousness; and would also'be an enemy of his fellow creatures, because he would be injuring them by such a deception. Such an enemy would be wilfully malicious, wicked beyond the power of Words to describe: and any one who would expose his deceptions would be a benefactor to his fellow men and ought to have their gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vitally Interested</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">B</span><span class="font8">OES the Bihle reveal the fact that God has such an enemy? Most assuredly it does, and every one who loves the Lord should know who this enemy is. He is most wicked and ma-licious; his every purpost: is to misrepresent God and His truth, and to keep the people from a proper conception of the goodness and mercy ami love of God, To do ibis successfully, he must deceive them, and must also keep himself in the background: for if the people should recognize the deceptive teachings and methods as coming from this enemy they would spurn them and him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, Who is this enemy? Tim answer is, Satan, called also the Devil. Let me cite some texts, in proof of this assertion. Tn Alatt. 12:25-39, Jesus spake a parable, in which .He represented Himself as sowing good seed, and an enemy later sowing tares, in the same field. He said, “The lares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is Hm devil.&quot; Satan also showed lumself an enemy of Jesus, as well •as an enemy of righteousness, when he tempted Jesus to make bread out of stones, to cast Himself down from the temple, and to fall down and worship Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is Satan that caused the spurious passages to be inserted in the Bible, as a basis for false doctrines that would misrepresent God, It is Satan that has used men as dupes, in translating the Bible, to mistranslate certain words so as to misrepresent the truth. It is Satan who has taught the people false and wicked doctrines and has tried to pervert the symbolic and parabolic language of the Bible to support his lies. He desires to keep the people in ignorance of God, so that he may continue to use them as Ips dupes. For 6,000 years he has been the persistent enemy of God and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan always works through human dupes. We should get this thought well in mind; otherwise we shall not be prepared to accept- the truth about Satan’s deceptions. It is quite difficult for some people to grasp the truth that the Devil uses men, and ofttimes those who are regarded as the best people in the community, to further his deceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">f'extg N&amp;t in the Bible' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T ET us note the different, varieties of falla-•*-* eie§, in the order mentioned above. First, sayings supposed to be a part of the Bible. Many people think that rhe statements, “God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb&quot; and “Cleanliness is next to godliness” are in the Bible. They are not found there. These are not very harmful, however, except that they are foolish, and both statements are untrue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Tib: words “immortal smil” are likewise supposed to be in the Bi hie, bni th'\v are not found there; nor is anything aldn to them to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the false doctrine of eternal torment, and is directly opposed to many scriptures. There are at least 101 different texts which say that souls die, and several which plainly state that man is mortal. This fallacy or deception is encouraged by nearly ail clergymen and completely nullifies the beautiful teaching of the resurrection of the dead; for if people do not die how can they be resurrected? To get around this argument it is claimed that it is the body that dies and is resurrected. Another fallacy. Another deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible in point blank language says that the body will not be resurrected. (See 1 Cor. 15: 36,37.) Not a single text says that the body-dies; but always the Bible asserts that it is the soul that dies. This fallacy makes God a liar, and the Bible a book that can not be relied, on; and this is a part of Satan’s purpose in making the deception. He is called The deceiver of the whole world’, and he has surely got everybody to believe this lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Doctrines Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">KTOW let us notice some other doctrines that are supposed to be supported by Scripture texts. First in order is the “trinity” fallacy, a doctrine that is revered to the extent that many Christians speak of it as the “holy ahd blessed trinity”. Think of dignifying a falsehood and a slander against God! Let us examine the only two texts that seem to support it. In 1 John 5:7 wo read: “There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” If it were true that the Father, the Word and the holy ghost are one, why would the testimony be given in heaven? Surely everybody in heaven would know it Thus the very phraseology is ambiguous and unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But let us examine a little closer, and we find that all the more recent translations leave out the words “in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one”. The words are left out of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott,</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font8"> translation, and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why are they left out! Let me quote what is</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It reads: “This text is not. contained in any</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It means that more than tour hundred years after the Bible was completed, some one ad-died these words, and that John never wrote them, and that they are no part of .the Bible. The apostle mentions certain punishments that vid ■ be meted ont to those who add to or take from the AVord of God. and the man who added these</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another text supposed to support the doctrine of the “trinity&quot; is found in John 10: 30, which reads: “1 and my Father are one.” This text is claimed to moan that Jesus meant that He and His Father were one and the same person. Jesus, praying for His disciples, said, “I pray . . . that they may be one even as we are one.” (John 17: 22) Did Jesus mean that Ills twelve disciples might be one in person? Most assuredly not. But the text says “that they may be one as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">we are one”.</span><span class="font8"> This is positive proof that Jesus never meant that He and His Father wore one in person, as the catechisms and creeds say. The very thought is ridiculous, and that is why Satan got people to believe it; for he well knew that the more ridiculous he could make the Bible and Jehovah God appear, the less would sensible people reverence God and -obey Him, Millions of people will have nothing to do with the Bible because they believe it teaches all the nonsense that the clergymen claim it does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Commissions Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A NOTHEIi fallacy that has deceived the ■£%,nunds of millions of people is found in ilitiiliiiiHifc</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">chapter. They are now known to be additions to the Word of God. Some presumptuous person dared to add these words, and, as usual when the worldly-wise would try to help God out. they made a mess of it; for the text states things that every sensible person knows are not true. Yet the words have deceived thousands and have wofully misrepresented God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people have failed to see that God is not trying to convert the world now, but has reserved that work to he done in a future age, and to be done by Christ and the church. The Bible clearly states that the Lord has been visiting the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name; that He is now drawing and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">perfecting the bride diass of 144,000, and that these are to come up in the first resurrection and reign with Christ for a thousand years. After this work is completed and the first resurrection is completed the world is to be converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Millions of people, however, have tried to convert the world during the past century, and have believed that the Bible authorized them to do it, and that one of these spurious verses contains this authority. Take away this verse and there is no authority for such a thought to be found in the Bible. The verse reads: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every .creature.” All modern translations reject these verses, and all Bibles that have comments in the back explain that they axe not found in ancient manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Damnations Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE next verse (16) states two untruths. It reads: “He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Something more than to believe and be baptized, is necessary to salvation. Peter says that we must add to our faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and love; and adds, “If ye do these things, ... an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” Basing their thought on the spurious text, millions of people have believed that all that was necessary to be saved, was to believe and be baptized and join some church. The truth is that millions of those who profess to believe and who have been baptized are not fit to go to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The text also says that “lie that believeth not shall be damned”, and millions of people have seized upon this text to prove the wicked and false doctrine of eternal torment. There have been billions of unbelievers who have never heard of the name of Jesus Christ, and they are not going to be damned either; for the Bible teaches that the Lord will awaken them all in the resurrection, and bring them to a knowledge of the truth, and give them everlasting life if they obey that knowledge. For instance, four hundred years after Sodom was destroyed the Prophet Ezekiel said that Sodom would return to her former estate, that is, come back to life on earth again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Paul said, “The times of this ignorance God has overlooked, . . . because he has apopinted a day, in the which he will judge the world in rightteousuess, by that man whom he has ordained/ (Acts 17: 30, 31) Many other texts can be cited showing that people will have an opportunity to get the truth and live, during the judgment day. This will be true especially of all those unbelievers who have never heard of the Lord or of the truth. It is not true that they are to be damned. How many preachers and evangelists have used this text to scare people to repent, thus dishonoring Jehovah God and. misrepresenting His truth! Others, basing their thought on this false and wicked text, have suffered anguish of mind and heart as they have supposed their loved ones to be in eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Signs Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ERSES 17 and 18 of this same chapter (Mark 16) are also wicked perversions of</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">the truth, and have deceived thousands into believing falsehoods about G-od and His Word. “These signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These words are not found in the oldest manuscripts, which is a positive proof that they are not a part of the Bible. Several hundred years after the Bible was completed and all of its writers were dead, some one added these words. So it is very evident that if any are able to cast out devils, or take up serpents, or drink deadly poison, or lay hands on the sick and heal them, they are doing it -without Scriptural authority, not doing it in the name of the Lord. It is possible that Satan might assist some in doing these things in order to further his deceptions; but our opinion is that no healings have been done, and that it is impossible for any human being to drink deadly poison and live, unless there is a doctor with a stomach pump near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what harm do these false doctrines do? They misrepresent the truth and its Author, Jehovah God. They make God responsible for things that He has not promised to do. They awaken false hopes and fears in the hearts of millions of people; and if these hopes or fears are not realized, God is blamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They throw wide open the door of opportunity for fakirs and fanatics to impose on the people and wrest money from them for cures that are never wrought and that ofttimes leave the patient in a worse condition than before, besides souring him against God, whom he charges ■with the failure. They harm the one who attempts to do the cure; for any honest man knows that he can not do the things mentioned in these texts. It is only those who are dishonest, or have a large bump of self-esteem and conceit, who even attempt to do these cures; and the result to such is that they claim to be special agents of Jehovah, living nearer to Hirn and hawing a confidential relationship to Him, when in fact Satan is using them to injure, to deceive and defraud, their fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bernards Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">NOTHER fallacy, which Satan has used to deceive millions of people, is the teaching that infants go immediately to heaven at death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible teaches that infants as well as all others, when they die, go into the grave, there to remain until the Lord shall awaken all of the dead at His second advent and at the establishment of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In most positive language we are told that the dead know not anything (Eccl. 9:5), yet people like to think that their babes are in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what harm does this belief do? The harm ’done is that parents have a false hope. Such a belief makes the Bible untrue. It denies the resurrection of the dead. It overlooks the fact that the child is a sinner in God’s sight. It denies that faith is necessary to salvation, a tiling most emphatically stated in the Bible. The apostle says, “Without faith it is impossible to please God.” (Tleb. 11:6) Jesus said, “Whosoever believeth in Him [the Sion of God] should . . . have everlasting life.” (John 3: 16) Peter says that it is necessary to add to our faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness and other graces, in order to be saved. Every one knows that an infant can not exercise faith or do any of the other things mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Satan delights to give people false hopes and false doctrines, and then have them blame God for not doing the things that are inspired by these false hopes and doctrines. These false theories and doctrines have made the Bible to many people a bundle of contradictions. They have made it ridiculous to millions of people who use their brains. The seeming contradictions which are supposed to be found in the Bible are only statements that contradict some false doctrine which we hold in our mind. The Bible does not contradict itself, but it does contradict the creeds of Christendom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Stokers Not in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">NOTHER fallacy is the general belief that the Bilslc teaches that the Devil is in hell, stoking fires. Over and over the Bible says that the Devil, like* a roaring lion, is going up and down in the earth seeking whom he may devour. Paul says that he is the god of this world; and Jesus said that the Devil is the prince of this world. V/e are told that he entered into Judas Iscariot. We are told that he blinds, deceives and ensnares people and that we are to resist him; and yet in the face of all these texts most Christians believe that he is far away in a place of torment, roasting people who are unfortunate enough to go to hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil is cunning and knows that it will serve his purpose best to make people believe that he is not around anywhere. He does not want people to get the idea that he is trying to deceive them, or that he is busy laying snares; for their feet. Hence lie deceives the people into believing that he is busy doing work that God gave him to do; for nearly everybody believes that God made the place of torment, and that He made the Devil and appointed him to roast people. What a slander this is! Satan is God’s adversary, God's enemy. God did not create him as Satan. He did not make a place of torment, and He did not appoint Satan to roast people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us note what the Bible has to say about Satan's roasting people in a lake of fire and brimstone. Matthew 25: 41 says that the lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels. These are the words of Jesus. In Revelation 20:10 we are told that the Devil is to be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone. In Hebrews 2:14 we are told plainly that the Devil is to be destroyed. What a different light the Scriptures throw on this subject! How they show up the falsity of the creeds! The Bible points out that the lake of fire and brimstone is a symbol of complete and absolute destruction, and that the Devil is to be cast into it, which means his de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">574</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">struction. But Satan has fooled the people into believing that the fire and brimstone is real fire and brimstone, and that God made it to torture people in and appointed him to do the torturing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Injustice Not in the Bible</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">UT what harm has this fallacy done? It has led people to regard God as being wicked, cruel and unjust, and to regard the Devil as being a pretty good fellow since he was so conscientiously doing just what God made h</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font8"> for. The minds and hearts of millions have been tortured with the thoughts of loved ones being tortured by Satan. Other millions have been led to curse God and repudiate the Bible because they thought it taught these God-dislion-oring doctrines. It has driven millions away from the Bible, just what the cunning Devil intended it to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another fallacy which Satan has used as the basis of three deceptions is found in our Lord’s words to the thief on the cross. Jesus actually said, “Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shaft be with me in paradise.” Satan succeeded in using a human dupe to put the comma in the wrong place; and so it reads in the common version thus: “Verily I say unto thee, Today thou shaft be with me in paradise.” This fallacy has been productive of much mischief. Let us notice the false doctrines based on this deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First, people have been led to believe that “paradise” means either heaven or an intermediate state somewhere, they know not where. But the word “paradise” means a garden, and originally applied to Eden. Eventually the whole earth is to be a paradise; that is, it is to be like the garden of Eden. Christ’s kingdom will bring about this condition, and we are told that the desert shall blossom as the rose; that instead of the thorn should come up the fir tree, and instead of the briar, the myrtle tree. When Jesus said, “I sa.y unto thee today, Thou shaft be with me in paradise,” lie meant simply that the thief would come up in the resurrection on the earth again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bhooklys,</span><span class="font4"> N. Y.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Second, the ordinary understanding of these words teaches that Jesus and the thief both went to heaven that very day. But over and over the Bible deciares that Jesus was in the grave for three days; and after He came out of the grave He said to Mary, “I have not yet ascended to my Father.” This is a point blank contradiction of the thought that Jesus went to heaven that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Repentances Not in the Bible</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280530_files/g_E_19280530-14.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">THIRD false teaching that has its basis in this misunderstood text is that of a deathbed repentance, or in other words the view that a man may live a sinful life, and on his deathbed manifest regret and go immediately to heaven. Multitudes of Christians believe this false teaching. Let us notice that the thief did not confess any sin nor ask for forgiveness. The Bible teaches that a man must be faithful unto death to win a place in heaven. He must deny himself and take up his cross and follow in Jesus’ footsteps. It teaches that he must put on joy, peace, gentleness, patience, meekness, goodness, faith. It teaches that a man must overcome the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The doctrine that a death-bed expression of regret -will entitle any one to the kingdom of heaven is a delusion and a snare, put forth by Satan. It has led millions to waste their lives in sin, expecting that they could be saved by a last-minute prayer. And this fallacy has boon fostered and promulgated by all the clergymen and evangelists of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul declared that Satan is the god of this evil world, and that it'is Satan who blinds the minds of them that believe not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a wonderful truth is here expressed, namely, that it is those who do not believe the Bible who are blinded. When a man believes the plain statement of the Bible, that the dead know nothing, Satan can not deceive him into believing that dead people are more alive than ever. Those who do not believe the Bible will be deceived. A fallacy is something that deceives the mind, and Satan blinds the minds of those who believe not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Story Six</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font8">ESUS had many enemies, but of them all the greatest was Satan, the Devil. This evil being tried every possible way to kill the child ’Jesus, and even in Jesus’ later life the Devil tried to make Him waver in His purpose of ransoming mankind from death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil is not our friend, and never was. He it is who causes good things to appear bad, and bad things to take on a semblance of goodness, so that even those who love the Lord and try to do His will, are sometimes deceived. Jehovah God is permitting the Devil to try the Lord’s people in this ’way in order that those who are really and truly earnest in their love for God will show themselves so by their actions under trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some time after Jesus was born, wise men, or as we might say, professors, who lived afar off in the East, came to Jerusalem. They had seen a peculiar appearance in the sky which seemed like a star, and knowing of the writings of the holy prophets in the Old Testament, these professors had surmised that the time was about due for the coming of the deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore upon the appearance in the sky of this light, or star, the professors set off upon a journey to Jerusalem. Arriving there, they inquired of every one, “Where is he that is born King of the Jews, for we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now there was at this time a king of Israel who was named Herod. Herod was a very bad king. He was cruel and deceitful. Also, like all human kings, he liked power and -wanted to keep everything in his. own hands. Naturally, when the wise professors came into Jerusalem crying, “Where is he that is born King of the Jews,” Herod was very surprized and not a little troubled. He feared that a great king had arisen somewhere and was marching upon him to take away his glory and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">King Herod therefore called before him all the learned men of Jerusalem, and inquired of them where the birth of this king that the wise men had mentioned, was supposed to take place. Audthey made answer, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet.” When Herod heard this he called the professors, or wise men, before him privately, and asked them the exact time at which they had seen the light in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When they had told him all they knew about it, this bad king pretended to be much interested, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now all this sounded like a very fair speech; but we shall see later that the Devil, acting through the wicked false mind of King Herod, was really trying to kill Jesus. Herod did not want to worship the young child Jesus; he merely wanted the wise men to find out where Jesus was, so that the babe could be killed. For Herod was a murderer, like most kings, and would think nothing of killing a young baby if such a deed would keep himself in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wise men then left the palace of Herod and began their journey toward Bethlehem. The same bright light appeared to them again in the sky, just ahead of them, and seemed to move along through the air until it came just over the spot where the young child Jesus was. There it seemed to the wise men to stop. The Bible says that when the wise men “saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Probably the wise men were- honest in their desire to worship Jesus, for God warned them in a dream to go home by another way, so that they would not have to come before Herod again and give him the information he wanted. After seeing and worshiping the young child Jesus in Bethlehem, they departed into their own country, taking care not to go near Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although many pretty songs and stories have been written about this light, or “star” that guided the wise men, and it has been looked upon for hundreds of years as something very beautiful, still the time has now<sup>7</sup> come when full light is being turned upon some very dark places in God’s Word which were hard to understand before. This light is the light of God’s own TRUTH, which unfolds the beautiful workings of Jehovah’s Plan to all who will study the Bible with the desire to learn about the glorious time which Jehovah has promised to the. whole world, and which is fast approaching in fulfilment of the Word of God. Many people read the Bible, but do not study it with the lov§ of God in their hearts; and to such it is still a closed book, full of contradictions and mysteries.</span></p>

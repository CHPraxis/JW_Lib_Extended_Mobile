<p><span class="font7">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A NEW BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That further witness to the name of Jehovah might be given to the people the Society is publishing a new book, the title of which is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font7"> The philosophy of the atonement sacrifice as related to reconciliation is discussed at length. The book Is illustrated. To the anointed of the Lord it is written; “God has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given to us the ministry of reconciliation.” It is important that the anointed have a clear vision of reconciliation that their ministry in connection therewith might be intelligently performed. We feel sure that the book will help to a better understanding of this vital doctrine. We therefore advise a careful study of the book; and then let all who love the Lord get it into the hands of the truth-hungry people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first edition, of course, is more expensive because of selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and plan of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesug has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE HOPE of the peoples of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life and those who obey will live on. earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A letter in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> from Brother Woodworth suggests the classes’ giving up their halls and devoting all to a national weekly radio hook-up.

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark18"></a>THE ANTICHRIST</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Who is a liar hut he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Son/'—1 John 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font8">N WRITING to the church of God the Apostle John stated that the manifestation of the antichrist would be a proof that the “last time” had been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Responding to the question of his disciples as to what would indicate the end of the world, and therefore “the last days”, Jesus said: “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” (Matthew 24:24) There has never, during the period of Christianity, been so much deception abroad as just at this time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> “Christ” means the “anointed” of God. Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of man by His own blood. He is more than that. He is God’s anointed Executive Officer to carry out Jehovah’s purposes. He is the great King whom Jehovah has placed upon his holy throne of Zion. He is the Head of God’s organization, through which organization Jehovah will bless all the families and nations of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> “Antichrist” is that which is against Christ. It is an organization in opposition to Christ. The Scriptures plainly state that antichrist is a liar and deceiver. (2 John 7) The father of lies, the great deceiver, and the malicious opponent of Christ, is Satan the Devil. (John 8:44; Revelation 12: 9; 13:14; 20: 2, 3) Satan has builded a powerful organization, both visible and invisible, by and through which he has deceived the people and kept them in subjection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Christ is a Priest for ever after the order of Mel-chizedek. (Psalm 110:4) Priest, as here used, means God’s Executive Officer who shall for ever carry out God’s purposes. But Christ, the “anointed” of God, more particularly refers to him as King or Ruler of the world. To anoint means to clothe with authority. (Isaiah 61: 1, 2) David vzas anointed to be king over Israel. (1 Samuel 16:13; 2 Samuel 5:3) David was a type of Christ Jesus, whom God anointed to be King over the world. (Acts 4: 27; 10: 38; Hebrews 1:9) Responding to Pilate’s question Jesus said: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” (John 18:37) The proof is, therefore, con-elusive that the name “Christ” has more particular reference to rulership. When the time arrives for Jehovah to send his beloved Son forth to reign as King he says: “Yet have I set [anointed, margin] my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Psalm 2:6) It was then that Jehovah commanded all the rulers of the earth to be obedient to his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Since the anointing therefore refers to Christ as King, “antichrist” must specifically refer to that organization which is opposed to God’s kingdom by and through Christ. It must include all creatures who are active members or supporters of that organization. In arriving at the conclusion as to who is Christ, and who is of the antichrist, it is only necessary to ascertain who is for Christ’s kingdom and who is against Christ’s kingdom. Jesus said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” (Matthew 12:30) Upon the authority of these words all who are not affirmatively for Christ and his kingdom are against him and against that kingdom, and either directly or indirectly supporting the enemy organization. Those who serve and support the organization of Satan the enemy would therefore be of the antichrist.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">DECEIVER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Since the Scriptures plainly say that the antichrist is a deceiver, then it follows that the active agencies of the antichrist are practising a fraud upon the people that results in deception. One who teaches and practises the truth could not deceive, because he misleads no one. Those who deceive must be teaching and practising that which is not true, and doing so subtly and fraudulently. To deceive means to mislead by the practice of hypocrisy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’ A strong example of this is found in the Pharisees, who were the clergy when Jesus was on earth. They claimed to represent God and to teach the truth. They drew near unto God with their lips, but their hearts were far removed from him. They were practising deception, and for that reason Jesus said to them that they were supporters and the children of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(John 8: 42-44) He denounced them as hypocrites because they were claiming one thing and doing another. His words are clear and emphatic: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee! cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.” —Matthew 23: 23-28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Paul, the inspired witness of Jehovah, wrote concerning the “last days” and specifically mentions that at that time there would be a company of men who are great deceivers, claiming to represent God but in fact representing Satan the enemy. “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">having a form of godliness, hut denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” — </span><span class="font8">2 Timothy 3:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Of necessity it follows that the men embraced within the description of the apostle here given form a part of the antichrist. If there are companies of men or organizations claiming to represent God and yet whose course of action is exactly contrary to God’s Word and his kingdom of righteousness, then there is but one conclusion to be drawn, and that is that such companies or organizations of men are a part of the antichrist. If they claim to represent the Lord and yet are not telling the people the truth, and their course of action is against God and Christ and his kingdom, then they are deceivers. If they have a form of godliness and yet deny the power thereof, then they are clearly within the Scriptural definition of the antichrist, and the Lord’s Word says: “From such turn away.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> In order that the people might intelligently follow the apostle’s advice they must know the facts. The only purpose of this publication is to set forth the facts for the benefit of those who desire to know the truth. Let it be clearly understood that what is here said is not for the purpose of provoking controversy or holding up individuals to reproach or scorn. If the Devil has a great organization that is deceiving the people, then the people must have the opportunity to know the truth for their own protection. All honest men, whether they be the rulers or the ruled, should desire the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">CLERGY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Whom do the clergy of the present day, as a class, serve, Jehovah God and his Christ or the Devil? They can not be the servants of both. “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Romans 6:16) “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.”—1 Corinthians 10: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> How may the correct answer to this question be ascertained? Jesus announced the rule: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” (Matthew 7:20-23) Again Jesus said: “Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.”—Matthew 21:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>13</sup> The words of Jesus prove that even though many claim to be followers of Christ, unless they bring forth the fruits of his kingdom they are against his kingdom and are therefore of the antichrist. In order to bring forth the fruits of the kingdom one must believe and teach that Jehovah is the only true God; that Christ Jesus is his Son, and that his shed blood provides the redemptive price for man’s salvation from sin and death; that Christ taught his followers to keep themselves separate from the world and to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom and the doing of his will on earth as in heaven; that Christ promised to come again and establish his kingdom; and that until that time all his true followers will be wholly devoted to God and to Christ. Those who bring forth the fruits are made up of a people whom God has taken out for his name, and who faithfully represent his name until the coming of the kingdom.—Acts 15:14-17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> The facts, as they exist and are well known to all, are now here submitted. The Scriptures are cited bearing upon these facts. The Scriptures constitute the rule or law by which a just conclusion must be reached. Having the facts and the law, let each one who reads determine for himself whether the organizations known as the church systems, particularly the clergy and the principal of their flocks, are a part of God’s organization or are a part of the Devil’s organization. If it is determined from the facts and the law that they are serving Satan and are a part of his organization, then they are a part of the antichrist.' If that conclusion is reached, then it becomes the privilege and duty of every one who loves righteousness to forsake and turn away from the false teachers and seek the truth at the Word of Jehovah God. The time has come when the people must take their stand either on the side of Jehovah God or on the side of the Devil, and for this reason they must be brought in contact with the truth. To aid the people in arriving at a just conclusion is the reason for setting forth the following facts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">DENYING THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup> There are two general classes of clergymen, the one calling themselves Modernists and the other designating themselves as Fundamentalists. Let us indulge the presumption that both are honest. Then there must be some sinister influence that causes them to differ so materially; and this raises the question, Whom do they serve? The position of the Modernists is briefly stated thus: That Jehovah God did not create man, but that man is the result of the process of evolution; that the Bible account of man’s creation and his fall by reason of sin is untrue and not to be relied upon; that man does not need and never did need a Redeemer, hence the shed blood of Jesus Christ upon Calvary has no real value to the human race. They therefore dispute the Word of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>16</sup> Below are given the statements made by a number of clergymen on the question of evolution, and which are in opposition to the Bible statement of the creation of man. This is done in order that the people may be aided in determining whom the Modernists represent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>17</sup> Charles Darwin was one of the foremost advocates of evolution. He denied the Biblical statement of God’s creation of man and advanced the theory that man evolved from a very low order of animal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, the leading figure of the Federation of Churches in America, writing concerning the influence of Darwinism (See chapter XIV, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution or Christianity.)</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Darwin was the first to receive and transmit a light which, without him, might have been indefinitely delayed. . . . To Darwin belongs the credit, therefore, for inoculating his own and after generations with the majestic conception of an unbroken and resistless continuity of life; a life with inherent qualities which preserve its continuity, a life which never turns back, and always proceeds from the lower to the higher. . . . The saliency of further reflection eventually severed him from the moorings of Biblical and scientific traditions. . . . The Darwinian explanation appeals to me as the greatest I have ever known as regards the attributes of the Presiding Mind. . . . Had the Church been quick to seize the skirts of circumstances, the Darwinism discovery would have served her well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>19</sup> Reverend Harry Emerson Fosdick (chapter XVI, same book) says:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Our greatest teachers, as well as the poorest, those who are profoundly religious as well as those who are scornfully irreligious, believe in evolution. . . . Positively the idea of an immanent God, which is the God of evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker who is the God of an old theology.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> The Bishop of Birmingham, England, from his pulpit said:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Darwin’s assertion that man has sprung from apes has stood the test of more than fifty years of critical examination. . . . Increasing knowledge and careful inquiry have but confirmed its truth. As a result, stories of the creation of Adam and Eve, of their primal innocence and their fall, have become merely folklore. Darwin’s triumphs have destroyed the whole theological scheme.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>21</sup> In this connection the words of Dr. A. Wakefield Slaten seem appropriate:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">I have been educated in theological schools. I can hardly realize it is possible for a priest or preacher to go through the training provided him and come out an honest man.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> Rev. Chauncey J. Hawkins, pastor of the First Congregational Church of San Francisco, is quoted by the press as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Courageous acceptance of the scientific theory that man was originally a lower animal and evolved to his present state was the solution of the problems confronting the modern ■ church offered by the pastor, who declared that organized religion would never regain its status as “a vital factor in the life of humanity” unless it renounces belief in the story of man’s origin contained in the book of Genesis. ‘‘The church is faltering in the midst of a tragic world.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>23</sup> Rev. Dr. John Haynes Holmes, of New York, as reported by the public press, says:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Things have happened in the past 2000 years. The psychology of St. Paul is over. Modern man sits at the feet of the scientist, the astronomer, the sociologist and biologist. Modern man is reading biology, not theology. Modern man refuses to believe that there is anything sacred. . . . A new religion will evolve out of the mists confronting contemporary Judaism and Christianity. This new religion will recognize every particular religion as a divine and holy thing. It will have no one god and no one faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> reports Dean Shailer Matthews of the University of Chicago Divinity School as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Can we be Christians and still use our intelligence or must we sacrifice our intelligence for the sake of our faith? Christianity need not be restricted by the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>25</sup> Tennessee enacted a law forbidding the teaching in any of the universities, normal or public schools, of a theory that denies the story of the divine creation of man as taught in the Bible, and teaching instead that man descended from a lower order of animal, making it a misdemeanor to thus teach the evolution theory. One Professor Scopes was indicted and put on trial for teaching evoluton. The late Hon. Wm. J. Bryan made a valiant defense in favor of the Bible. The trial court had its sessions opened with prayer by a Fundamentalist. This did not please the Modernists. Modernist preachers attending presented the following petition to the court:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">We beg you to consider the fact that among the persons intimately connected with and actively participating in this trial of John T. Scopes there are many to whom the prayers of the Fundamentalists are not spiritually uplifting and are occasionally offensive; inasmuch as by your own ruling all the people in the courtroom are required to participate in the prayers by rising, it seems to us only just and right that we should occasionally hear a prayer which requires no mental reservations on our part and in which we can conscientiously participate.—[signed] Rev. C. F. Potter, minister West Side Unitarian Church, N. Y.; Rabbi Jerome Mark, Temple Beth-El, Knoxville, Tenn.; Rev. F. W. Hagan, First Congregational Church, Huntington, W. Va.; Rev. D. M. Welch, minister Knoxville Unitarian Church.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> Dr. McAfee, before a conference of presidents of fifty-seven Presbyterian universities and colleges, at Des Moines, is reported by the press as making the following statement:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The god of evolution is a more potent factor In life than the god of the Bible.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>27</sup> The Northwestern University sent questionnaires to ministers to obtain their voice on doctrines of Modernism and Fundamentalism. The following is from an editorial of the Atlanta </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Georgian</span><span class="font8"> of May 17, 1928:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Of the 436 who replied, 47 percent asserted their conviction that God made the world as the book of Genesis declares; but 61 percent said that the idea of evolution, is consistent with a belief in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only 80 percent declare God omnipotent and only 68 percent think God ever shows His omnipotence by miracles. In this matter nearly one-third of the ministers who replied agree apparently with that (of old-time) famous “infidel”, Colonel Ingersol, whose infidelity consisted in asserting that “the miraculous is false”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>28</sup> In fiat contradiction of the statements of the distinguished modem clergy God’s Word says: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”—Genesis 2: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>29</sup> All the works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deuteronomy 32:4) “This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.”—Genesis 5:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>30</sup> Man violated God’s law, was sentenced to death and expelled from Eden. (Genesis 2:17; 3:15-24) “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12) God promised to redeem man from death. (Hosea 13:14) Jesus came to earth, and became man’s Ransomer. (Matthew 20:28; John 10:10) The means of salvation is by faith in the blood of Jesus. (John 3:16; Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2:3-6) The promise is that man shall receive the blessings of life and restoration at the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and his kingdom.—2 Timothy </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">4:</span><span class="font8">1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>31</sup> Comparing the foregoing statements of the Modernist clergy with the above statements plainly set forth in God’s Word, let the answer to the question be determined, Whom do these ministers represent and serve, God or the Devil? In this connection consider also the following words quoted from the Scriptures:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>32</sup> “Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.”—Colossians 2:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>33</sup> “Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.”—1 Timothy 4:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>34</sup> “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be . . . traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”—2 Timothy 3:1, 2, 4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>35</sup> The apostle warned against this very thing and that men would appear as representing righteousness and at the same time represent the Devil. “For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.” (Acts 20: 29) “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” —2 Corinthians 11:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>36</sup> There are many principal ones in the church systems who love to have such teachers because they hide from them their own responsibility. The apostle warned against such when he wrote: “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables [evolution is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">fable].”—2 Timothy 4:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>31</sup> God foreknew and foretpld through his inspired writers that in the last days such “damnable heresies” would be brought in to destroy faith in him and his Word; therefore it was written: “But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">even denying the Lord that bought them,</span><span class="font8"> and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.”—2 Peter 2:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>33</sup> If God did not create man perfect, then of course man did not fall. If man did not fall he does not need a Redeemer, therefore the blood of Jesus amounts to nothing. It is conclusive upon the face of it that the Modernists’ theory which denies the Scriptural account of creation is a complete repudiation of the blood of Christ, which is the only means of salvation for humankind. Since Satan is the chief of liars and deceivers, and his organization is antichrist, it must be manifest to all that those who oppose Christ and deny his kingdom for the blessing of mankind are of antichrist and therefore are not to be trusted by the people as their teachers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">FUNDAMENTALISTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>39</sup> The Fundamentalists claim to believe Jehovah God and that the Bible is his Word of truth, and that Jesus </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">the Savior of the world. They claim that God created man and that man fell because of sin and was sentenced to death, but that only the body dies and that the soul of man is immortal and can not die; that therefore all evil men must spend eternity in endless torment and all the good ones must be taken to heaven. Their claims or teachings are contradictory and inconsistent, showing that they are deceived and do not represent God. If man had an immortal soul, he could never die; hence he could not be redeemed by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If the wicked go to eternal torment, then redemption and deliverance and restitution would be impossible. If man were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">eternally</span><span class="font8"> in torture, he could never be brought out. It is manifest that the Fundamentalists have been deceived by these doctrines and that their teachings are not true and consistent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>40</sup> Furthermore the Fundamentalist clergy teach the doctrine of the trinity, which is that there are three Gods in one, God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy ghost, all equal. That doctrine nullifies the great ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If Jesus was God himself, then his death could not be a substitute for the man; therefore he could not be man’s ransomer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>41</sup> The Scriptures plainly teach that there is one God and one Son, Christ Jesus, and that Jesus was made lower than the angels and made man in order that he might taste death for every man. (1 Timothy </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font8"> 3-6; Hebrews 2:9) God’s Word plainly states that a kingdom of righteousness shall be established amongst men, with Christ as King, and that under him all the obedient ones of the human race shall be restored to human perfection.—Acts 3 :19-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>42</sup> Whether the Fundamentalists be honest or dishonest is not necessary to determine in reaching the conclusion as to whom they represent. If they were God’s representatives, then their teaching would be in harmony with his Word and would be consistent. If what they teach is contradictory to God’s Word, then they are either wilfully wrong or are being deceived. Let us give them credit for being honest and then determine how they reached this wrong conclusion. It was Satan who introduced the doctrine of the immortality of the soul when he said to Eve: “Ye shall not surely die.” That statement was a lie, because Jesus so said; and that lie led to the death of man and to all the sorrow that has come upon mankind by reason of sickness and death.—John 8: 44; Romans 5:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>43</sup> The Scriptures plainly declare, “the soul that sin-neth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) That proves the soul is mortal and subject to death and, when dead, eternal torment would be an impossibility. Eternal torment is entirely inconsistent with a just and loving God. Many honest men have been turned against God because of this false doctrine, and Satan is the one who is responsible for it. “Inherent immortality of souls” and “eternal torment” cast reproach upon God’s name. This has ever been the policy of Satan, to cause men to hate God and turn away from him. If a man is teaching Satan’s doctrines, then that man is the servant of the Devil, whether he knows it or does not know it. Whether he teaches an error knowingly or unknowingly, he is working for the one that is reproaching Jehovah. The doctrines of inherent immortality and of eternal torment and the doctrine of the trinity were all originated and put forth by Satan for the purpose of blinding the people to the truth and turning them away from the just and true God and his means of salvation through Christ Jesus. Upon this point the apostle says: “But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are perishing [B. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">V.,</span><span class="font8"> margin] : in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>44</sup> Neither the Modernists nor the Fundamentalists teach that the hope of the mass of humanity lies in the fact that God will establish a righteous kingdom in the earth and offer full opportunity for man to be obedient to the Lord and be restored. In fact their whole teaching is against the reign of Christ over a righteous government as the invisible Ruler of man. Necessarily then they must be classed with the anti-kingdom or antichrist. This is said in all kindness. Man has been the victim of a great deception, the work of the Devil. It might ba asked then, How should man ever expect to know any better?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>45</sup> The apostle pointed out that greater light would come at the end of the world. (1 Corinthians 10: 11) Therefore the time is come when the people must begin to know the truth. Again it is emphasized that these statements here are made, not for the purpose of ridiculing men, but to point out to mankind that the great enemy of man is Satan the Devil.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">CHRISTENDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>46</sup> The word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom</span><span class="font8"> is a misnomer. It is defined by lexicographers, and generally so understood, to be those governments of earth which are Christian and which are followers of Christ. The word is used as synonymous with “Christ’s kingdom”. The clergy have made the people believe that many of the leading nations of earth constitute Christ’s kingdom, and therefore call these nations Christendom. This is a plain deception of the adversary, the Devil. When on earth Christ Jesus said: ‘My kingdom is not of this world. My kingdom is future.’ He taught his disciples to pray to God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (John 18:36; Matthew 6:10) He told his disciples that he would return and set up his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>47</sup> The Scriptures plainly teach that God’s kingdom or government will be established at the second coming of the Lord. When Christ takes full control of earth’s affairs Satan must be completely ousted and the government of earth will then be righteous. Christ’s kingdom could not be a corrupt government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>48</sup> It is well known that there is great corruption and misrule in every nation on earth; and particularly is this true in those nations called Christendom. Jesus Christ commanded that those of his kingdom must not kill. (Matthew 5: 21, 22) It is also written that no murderer shall be of the kingdom of God. (Galatians 5:21; 1 John 3:15) The World War, beginning in 1914, was participated in chiefly by the nations called Christian. The clergymen in all these nations urged the people to kill. Surely in doing so they were not servants of Christ but must be classed as servants of the Devil, who committed the first murder. — John 8: 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>49</sup> Lloyd George, in an address delivered at London, June 25, 1928, before the Welsh Church, said concerning the responsibility of the clergy in connection with the War:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Lot&gt;k at Europe today. After the terrible lesson we have had, there are more youths in the prime and vigor of life being taught and trained to kill each other than ever since the foundations of the world were laid. As minister when war began, I say that if all the churches In Christendom had said, ‘Halt. This murder must not begin,’ no monarch would have dared to plunge the world into war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>co</sup> The clergymen were advocates of the World War and urged the young men into the trenches; and in so doing whom did they represent?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>S1</sup> When the World War was on, there resided in many of the countries involved in the War some true followers of Christ Jesus who believed in taking literally his commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.” Preferring to obey the Lord rather than man, and therefore refraining from killing their fellow men, these Christian laymen declined to bear arms and kill. They were persecuted for it, ostracized, many of them imprisoned, while others were cruelly beaten and killed. The men who led the persecution against these Christians were the clergymen. Number </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">27 of The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> magazine, published by the I. B. S. A., Brooklyn, N. Y., sets forth detailed evidence of the part that many of the clergymen took in that persecution. Surely the Lord would not persecute any one who represented him because that one obeyed his commandment. Whom, then, did the clergymen represent in the persecution, God or the Devil ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>62</sup> The Bible describes the great world powers, from Babylon down to the present time, and mentions all of them under the symbol of “wild beasts” because of the cruelty of those governments. (Daniel 2:37-43; Revelation 17:13) All of those governments have been under the invisible rulership of the Evil One. “We [the followers of Christ] know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.” (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font8"> F.) The clergy have participated in the politics of all the earth's governments, and that particularly within the past fifteen hundred years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>53</sup> The League of Nations is a compact formed and entered into by many nations claiming to be Christian but whose invisible ruler is in fact Satan the Devil. The confederacy or League of Nations is plainly foretold in the Scriptures. (Isaiah 8:9, 10) That organization is designated as the “beast” that is against Christ and makes war against Christ and those that are with him. Therefore, plainly, the League of Nations is the instrument of Satan and is of the antichrist and against Christ’s kingdom. (Revelation 17:13-15) The League of Nations is the product of the Devil, organized by him for the purpose of keeping the people under his control. Many honest people were deceived and induced to support the League of Nations. They are not to be blamed. The blame should be put where it belongs, upon the enemy of man, Satan the Devil. Satan blinded many clergymen and caused them to advocate the League of Nations. The following was a resolution adopted by the Federal Council of Churches at the time of the organization of the League of Nations:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice, and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient; it is rather </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the political expression of the kingdom of God</span><span class="font7"> on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is “peace on earth, good will toward men”. Like the gospel, its appeal is universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The heroic dead will have died in vain unless out of victory shall come a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.—2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The church [nominal] can give a spirit of good will, without which no League of Nations can endure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>64</sup> In declaring this product of the Devil to be the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, surely the ones adopting this resolution were representing the Devil and not the Lord God; whether knowingly or ignorantly, does not alter the fact: “Ye are the servants of him whom ye serve.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>65</sup> Are Jehovah God and his Christ for the Republican party or the Democratic party ? One class of clergymen claim to represent the Lord and ally themselves with the Republicans; others ally themselves with the Democrats; and all pray for the success of their respective parties. The clergymen that support either party therefore are taking part in world politics which constitute a part of Satan’s organization. That being true the clergy are allied with the antichrist because they are against Christ’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>56</sup> At a meeting of the ministers of the Church Federation, held in Chicago, February 27, 1928, the following resolution was adopted by them:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Resolved, That the union minister’s meeting of the Chicago Church federation do hereby call upon all our people to assemble in their respective places of worship, Wednesday, March 7, and pray to Almighty God for strength and vision to discharge our responsibility as citizens in the task of selecting men for public office at the primary election on April 10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>67</sup> Were those ministers in favor of God’s kingdom through Christ in thus calling for public prayer; or were they trying to support the invisible ruler, who is now the god of this world, Satan the Devil? If they had been really representing the Lord would they not have followed the instruction of Jesus, and instead of praying to know how to elect men to office, pray as Jesus taught them: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>58</sup> In the early part of 1928 the Federal Trades Commission heard testimony exposing the gigantic and cruel combine, or power trust, known as the National Electric Light Association and the American Gas Association. The proof conclusively showed that these associations have systematically gone about bribing public officials to the detriment of the people. They have invaded the colleges and have subsidized professors to teach against the public interest, and now at a hearing in Washington^ on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">June 26, 1928, the evidence discloses that the clergy are engaged in aiding this power trust. The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font8"> in a dispatch from Washington of the above </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">date, </span><span class="font8">shows these bold head-lines: “Clergy aid power trust, U. 8. learns. Federal Trade Commission hears testimony naming ministers as propagandists. Earl W. Hodges of New York told the Commission about the ministers.” Were those clergymen working for Christ’s kingdom or for the Devil’s kingdom? Whom did they represent? The apostle states that they represent the one whom they serve, and they were serving a part of the Devil’s organization, which is antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">BUSINESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>89</sup> The clergy unite themselves with Big Business and politics to govern the world. Rev. Rahming, of Denver, from his pulpit recently said: “The church is trying to humanize capital and at the same time Christianize labor.” By their course of action and their words the clergy prove themselves to be a part of the world and are friends of the world, and the world is Satan’s organization, as the Scriptures plainly show. That proves they are not for Christ and his kingdom, therefore they are a part of the antichrist. Upon this point mark the following scriptures:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>60</sup> “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”—1 John 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>61</sup> “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”—James 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>62</sup> “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">enemy </span><span class="font8">of God.”—James 4: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">CHRIST’S KINGDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>83</sup> Christ is the Anointed One of Jehovah as King or Ruler of the world. Therefore the kingdom is spoken of as Christ’s kingdom, and also as God’s kingdom. When Christ, as God’s Anointed King, takes full control of all things on the earth, then there will be no part of his government that will be in the hands of boodlers, grafters, and lobbyists to rob the people. The great battle of Armageddon, which is now just ahead, will result in the complete destruction of all of Satan’s wicked organization that now oppresses mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>64</sup> Following the great conflict of Armageddon Christ wiR take full charge of earth’s affairs as its invisible Ruler. His will be a government of peace and righteousness. Note some of the consoling statements of God’s Word upon this point: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”—Isa. 9: 6, 7; 11:4-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">THE ENEMY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>85</sup> Satan the Devil is the enemy of all righteousness, (Acts 13:10) He is the enemy that has sown confusion and discord amongst the peoples of earth. (Matthew 13: 39) He is the arch enemy of God and his Christ. (Psalm 69:9; John 14: 30) Satan is man’s worst enemy because he brought suffering and death upon mankind. He is the enemy of the clergy because he has overreached many of them. Every organization that is against Christ’s kingdom is of the enemy or the antichrist. God through Christ will destroy in his kingdom all enemies, even death. (1 Corinthians 15:26) Through Christ he will destroy all the works of Satan and then destroy Satan himself. (1 John 3:8; Hebrews 2:14) In doing this Christ will clean up the earth and make it a fit place in which to live. Wars will cease and the people will learn war no more. (Isaiah 2: 2-4) Oppression will cease and all oppressors will be broken. (Psalm 72: 4; Isaiah 14: 4) The fact that the governments of earth now oppress the people and lay burdens upon them grievous to be borne is another proof that Satan is the great oppressor and the invisible ruler of this world. It shows further that the clergy who support the present oppressive systems are serving Satan, whether they do it willingly or blindly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>66</sup> Jehovah is the true Friend and Benefactor of man. Long ago he promised that he would bless all the families of the earth in his due time and that these blessings should come when his anointed Son, Christ Jesus, would take the rule over the world. (Genesis 12:3; Galatians 3:16, 27-29) God always keeps his promises. (Isaiah 55:11; 46:11) In his Word God declares that the people must be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth and that all must come to know him from the least to the greatest.—1 Timothy 2:3, 4; Jer. 31: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>67</sup> The time has now come for the people to begin to learn the truth. Before the expression of God’s wrath against Satan and his organization in the great battle of Armageddon, which is near, he commands that a witness must be given to the peoples and nations of earth that they may have an opportunity to seek him and be shielded during that great conflict. (Matthew 24:14; Zephaniah 2:2, 3) It therefore becomes the solemn duty of every man and woman who loves righteousness and who wants to see his fellow man benefited to tell his neighbor about what the present-day events mean. The people must learn that Satan the Devil has long been the god of this world and that he is their chief enemy and oppressor. They must learn that Jehovah is the only true God and the great Friend and Benefactor of men; and that Christ Jesus his anointed King will, through his kingdom, bring the people that which they sincerely desire. God has already placed his King upon his throne; and the battle of Armageddon, he states, must follow shortly.—Psalm 2: 6-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>68</sup> We are now entering the “day of the Lord” when his name must be exalted. “And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.” (Isaiah 12 : 4) Therefore let every one who loves righteousness “say among the nations that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously”.—Psalm 96:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>69</sup> It must now be manifest to all who have considered the matter that everything that is opposed to Christ’s kingdom and the knowledge of the truth concerning it is of the antichrist. The people should now take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Christ, and should seek the truth in the study of God’s Word that they may learn the right way and walk in it and be for ever blessed.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark19"></a>THE DAY OF JUDGMENT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font8">HROUGH the prophets of Israel the Bible foretold a day when God would gather together the nations of the earth, assemble the kingdoms, and then pour upon them his indignation. The Prophet Zephaniah, speaking in the name of Jehovah, said, “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” (Zephaniah 3: 8) That day is the day of God’s judgment upon the nations. Unquestionably that day and that judgment are now upon the world; hence the trouble into which it is thrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When it is remembered that these nations are chiefly those which, under the style of Christendom, or Christ’s kingdom, have professed the name of Christ, and thereby have protested to be under the control of the will of God and the teachings of Jesus, it is not difficult to see why God will pour out his indignation on them and will expose their mockery before all men. By thus naming themselves, or acknowledging the name, they have taken the name of God in vain; they have made the name of God to be dishonored among men. In their relationships one with another, instead of acting as followers of Jesus they have acted as wild beasts. They have fought each other, not in defence of righteousness or on behalf of oppressed peoples, but for pillage and theft and to enlarge their kingdoms. Might has ruled; right has been disregarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All men know that none of the nations of Christendom has at any time based its policies, whether foreign or domestic, upon the revelation of God or the teachings of Jesus Christ. In the eyes of men Great Britain has been considered to be the greatest of the Christian nations, and she has so considered herself; but despite that profession Great Britain has never given the slightest consideration to the Word of God or the teachings of Jesus when its governments have pursued their relationships with other peoples. The claim of these nations to be Christian is mockery in the sight of God. Hence his indignation is poured out on the nations as they refuse to accept the plain facts by which he speaks to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Naturally the nations which have gone into history have no place in this judgment: it can fall only upon those which are in existence when the day of Jehovah begins; except in this, that as the policies of the nations of the present are in effect the result of those of the past, the condemnation which falls on the present is a judgment on the past. The quarrels of the nations of the present day, which have resulted in dragging the world into war and almost into destruction, are the result of the warlike policies and foolish quarrels of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also, it is to be noted that this judgment of the nations, which of necessity affects all the peoples of the nations, does not in any sense take the place of that general judgment of which Jesus spoke when he said, “And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.”—Matthew 11:23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident from these words of Jesus that there is a day of judgment to come when all things connected with human history will be brought to the light. This judgment was first disclosed in the days of Enoch. Jude says, “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”—Jude 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wise man, when giving the summary of his questionings of life and its values, said, “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14) Jesus said of that day, “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” He added, “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” (Matthew 12:36, 37) The Apostle Peter says, “The Lord knoweth how . . . to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment.” —■ 2 Peter 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That there is a very solemn meaning to be given to the Bible’s warning of a day of judgment to come, is unquestioned. Whoever shall meet that judgment with inability to stand before its righteousness must suffer the wages of sin, which is death, the full and final end of life. But the judgment is not at all such as has been proclaimed by the leaders of Christendom. It is not a sudden affair, a sort of catastrophic climax which suddenly ends human history; but is, as should be expected in all things under the care of the gracious Creator, a time of righteous examination, in which justice may be done to all, and by which the Creator is magnified in his compassion and in the provision he has made for dealing with the sin of the world, as well as with the sinners who have fallen by the way, victims of their environment and weakness, rather than wilful opposers of God and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The declarations of theologians make that day the most terrible event in human history; but this interpretation is one of those doctrines of demons of which Paul speaks. (See 1 Timothy 4:1.) In another passage the Apostle Paul, when urging the brethren on to maturity, bidding them not to stop at the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, details these first principles, amongst which are the “resurrection of the dead, and .. . eternal judgment”. (Hebrews 6:1, 2) Theologians have ignored this statement as to the declaration of the judgment, or have interpreted it as meaning that the decisions of the judgment are eternal in that the sentence was never revised. Any student of the Bible may discover for himself that Paul means that the judgment itself is age-lasting. This, taken in conjunction with the declaration that the reign of Christ, to whom all judgment is given, is one of one thousand years, makes it clear that the eternal, or age-abiding, judgment (for so the word should be translated), is the day of Christ, the thousand-year world’s judgment day. What assurance there is here of care and justice and righteousness and deliverance for all who prove worthy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It does not require a great deal of study of the Scriptures to discover that while they show there would be no condoning of sin, the judgment day will nevertheless prove to be the day of man’s deliverance. When Paul spoke of that day to the men of Athens he said that God had given assurance of it to all men by the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. (Acts 17: 31) The day of judgment would bring God’s righteous judgment upon everything that has been injurious to his name and to the cause of righteousness, which is the doing of his will, and against all men who knowingly refuse to do his will, and who therefore are a positive hurt to all others and would be a source of danger to the human family of God whether in earth or in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whatever of fear there is for man in that day of judgment, it is evident that God has in it that for which men have groaned, however ignorantly; namely, deliverance from his foes, and the glorious liberty of the sons of God. (Romans 8:19) Unquestionably that day brings freedom as well as condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have said that Christendom, with its inevitable blundering, and in some cases with wilful perversion (as will be allowed as the truth comes to be known), has represented that day of general judgment as being the most dreadful day in all human history. Ecclesiastics have drawn terrible word pictures of things to be done in that day, as man meets his judgment; and artists, whose fame thereby has made their names to be world-known, have fixed on canvass the wilful imaginings of the ecclesiastics; and so it has come to pass that the shameful distortion of the plain meaning of the Word of God and of Christ has been fastened upon men’s minds. But no one who knows priestcraft has any doubt that all this was brought about in order to sustain their craft. Many good men have been deceived by them and have repeated what the craftsmen have taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the fall man has always been subject to fear. He has realized forces of evil against which it has ever been impossible for him to wage war. Also, he knows that, being imperfect, he may not stand before his Maker if he should be called into judgment. Thus he has been the victim of evil men as well as of evil spirits. Tn an age of superstition it therefore became easy for ecclesiastics to deceive men about God and to hide his goodness from them so that they might be kept in bondage to the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There can have been very few men who have not felt that they could not fight in equal battle in any attempt to do right. When a man has wished to take a right course in life, following that which leads to right and truth, he has always felt the strength of a pull in his nature which has hindered him. Ho man walks the upward path with ease: there is always a struggle. This is expressed by Paul, who, when speaking of the Jew under the law, saw the good (as indeed the law pointed it out to him), yet had to say that the good he would do he did not do because evil was ever present with him. (Romans 7:19) Also, Paul states a universal fact when he says death has reigned over all, because all have sinned. (Romans 5:12) The law of sin and death is entrenched in the being of fallen man: deep in his depraved nature are the roots of evil. Men of strong will may repress some of their evil propensities and measure-ably overcome their weaknesses, but none can prove himself a victor in that fight. All human experience corresponds to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If, then, since the fall of man there has been a weakness in him which has made it impossible to walk the straight path of morality, and which, when he has made some endeavor to lift himself up to higher things, has immediately brought him down to the dust, there must be an account taken of this in any judgment instituted by the righteous God, him of whom Abraham said, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Genesis 18: 25) Yet Christendom teaches that all such, as caught by death, or by the sudden coming of the day of judgment of which they speak, will be condemned, and rightly so, to everlasting destruction from the face of the Creator and from all hope of entrance into that glorious inheritance which God has in reservation for his human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the righteous God shall cause mankind to be judged in righteousness by that man whom he has appointed, namely, the man Christ Jesus, who is made judge of all men, “because he is the Son of man” (John 5: 27), there must be something to come to humanity besides condemnation and punishment for its sins and transgressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judgment implies trial, and trial implies full and proper consideration of all the circumstances of the case. Now, while it is true that all men from the beginning have been transgressors of the laws of God, whether of those which, as Paul says, are written in man’s nature or of those which God gave at Sinai specially for his people Israel, and that consequently all men are sinners in the sight of God and under condemnation of death, yet it is not thereby demonstrated that men are sinners at heart and wilfully so. The Apostle Paul, in speaking of this, says that this state of condemnation was upon all the children of Adam as they were born into the world. (Romans 5:14) It is to be noted, however, that the condemnation is not, as theologians so wrongfully teach, because God attributes Adam’s sin to his children; it is because the weakness and imperfection into which he had fallen made him that he could beget a son only in his own likeness, namely a son who was imperfect as he himself was after his sin and after the sentence of death had been passed upon him. Thus, while all men are sinners in the sight of God, not all are equally guilty before him. Of necessity those workers of iniquity, who have oppressed men, who have misled them, and who have kept them in the bondage of darkness, have a much severer judgment coming to them than have their victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That there are inequalities in human life, none will deny. Some are bom into the world with every moral and physical advantage; some are bom with neither of these, and often with the positive disadvantage of an environment wholly evil. Only a stem ecclesiastic who has been dehumanized by his harsh dogmas can consign these ill-favored ones to everlasting banishment from those joys of life which God has in reservation for his human family; and only a mind injured by thoughts which have come from demons can consign them to eternal torment or ascribe their terrible fate to God. But all men, of every condition, are under the law of sin and death; and thus a day of righteous judgment must be expected to bring deliverance to all, and with it a full opportunity for every one to show whether or not truth and righteousness, if known and available, would be appreciated and accepted. That day will determine this for every man. The psalmist said, “Lord, who is like unto thee, which deliverest . . . the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?” (Psalm 35:10) Undoubtedly this word applies not only to full deliverance which God will bring for the poor of the earth from all those unrighteous systems which have held men down, but also from that greater and more terrible bondage which has held man under the law of sin and death. The day of judgment is the day set apart by God for this great work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The important thing to seek in all study of the Bible as God’s revelation of his purpose, is the relationship which each part bears to the whole. Age has followed age, not in a natural process of development, but according to the purpose of God. The day of judgment, the last of the great times of the Bible, must be considered in its relationship to those which have preceded it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two things must be taken into account. First, since the fall of man God has not charged the world with its sin against him, but, as the Apostle Paul says, he has closed his eyes on it. (Acts 17:30) This does not mean that God has ignored the sin of the world, or that he condones sin. Second (and here is seen the reason for that course), God has in his love and compassion for the whole world of men provided a ransom price and a sin-offering whereby the sin of men may be covered. Now the day of judgment is the thousand years of Christ’s rule. It is then that the redemptive price which was gained on Calvary at so great cost both to himself in giving his dear Son, and to the Son in dying so hard a death according to his Father’s will and for man’s sake, will be used for all men. That day is also the time of resurrection, when, by the power of Christ, all that are in their graves shall come forth. (John 5: 28, 29) The world is handed over to Christ as the great Deliverer-Judge. The sins of the past are covered by his ransom price; and then, if there is obedience, full help will be given to each and all to attain to that full deliverance, and to that restoration to the perfection of humanity as it was seen in its beginning, in Adam, the father of the race, before he fell. This is the picture which Isaiah draws when he tells of the ransomed of the Lord returning (from the grave) and coming to Zion and obtaining joy and gladness for ever. See Isaiah 35.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark20"></a>PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO THE HEATHEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">O</span><span class="font8">NE of the last words of Jesus to his disciples was-his instruction to them, “Go ye . . . and teach all nations.” The instruction disclosed a very marked change of attitude on God’s part towards the nations, for, from the day, two thousand years earlier, when God made a covenant with Abraham, the father of the chosen people, to the time when Jesus spoke to his disciples, the peoples of earth had been left without any revelation from God, save that which all men have in the works of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the death of Jacob Israel W’as God’s nation. Thenceforth the peoples of earth were divided into the chosen and the non-chosen. The Israelites called the nations </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">goyim,</span><span class="font8"> which word is translated in the English Bibles by the words nations, Gentiles, heathen, people. The Israelites were the people of God; the others were not. To Israel God revealed himself and made his name known, as the Prophet Amos, when speaking for God, said, “You only have I'known of all the families of the earth.”—Amos 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus when Jesus told his disciples to go to all nations with the message of the kingdom of heaven he indicated a very decided change of attitude on God’s part towards the nations. But while this was the case there was actually no change in his disposition to them: God was always compassionate towards men. The change meant a development in his purposes. Even the disciples did not understand why the change had come about at that time. They had the expectation, common to the Jews, that their nation should be the teacher of all the nations. This seemed reasonable to hold in view of God’s dealings with them and the prophecies which had been spoken in the name of Jehovah. Isaiah in a typical passage had said, “Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.”—Isaiah 27: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Jews thought that some day they would be made rulers of the world and would make all men come under their tutelage and acknowledge God, as their king, David, had subdued the nations under him. But the expectation was that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">nation</span><span class="font8"> would do the work under the rule of the Messiah. This was in Peter’s mind when he addressed the crowds who had rushed to see the man whose life-long lameness had been cured miraculously by him and John in the name of the recently crucified Jesus. Peter then urged the people to repent of their sin against God in their rejection of his Messenger, and for what they had done to Jesus. Knowing what the prophets had said of God’s blessing to Israel, and of further blessings for the whole world, which were to go through the chosen people, he urged them to repentance so that times of refreshing might come to Israel and that the times of restitution might come to the world.—Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But as they watched the providences of the Lord, their minds quickened by the spirit which was given to them, the apostles discerned that the time for God to bless the world had not come; and so they perceived that there was no hope of Israel’s national restoration to repentance, nor to Jehovah’s favor upon them as a people till another work had been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They learned that it was God’s purpose to use them, the apostles, to gather the faithful remnant in Israel, and for some to go amongst the nations with the word of truth concerning Jesus; that through their ministry some would be gathered from amongst the nations. They saw by facts that God was gathering together a people for himself out of the Gentiles, for those who believed also received the gift of the holy spirit. Then it became clear that this gathered-out company would make a new Israel, a spiritual Israel, a spiritual nation, whose inheritance would be in heaven; whereas that promised to Abraham and to the Israelites would be the land of Canaan. Jesus, their leader, after his resurrection, had gone to prepare a place for them.—John 14:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though the commission to preach the gospel of the kingdom was given to the disciples as a company, and through them to the church which they represented, it was given to the Apostle Paul to make the matter clear to the apostles themselves, and then also to preach the gospel amongst the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul saw very clearly that his own people would not have the gospel of the kingdom according to the teaching of Jesus; and he saw too that his preaching among the Gentiles was not intended of the Lord to convert the nations to the teachings of Jesus. As for his own people he said he could wish himself accursed from his own privileges in Christ if only they would accept the truth and enter into the blessings God had for all who w<sub>O</sub>uld give themselves to him through Christ.—Romans 9: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But he knew that when the work which he was to begin among the nations should be finished Jehovah’s favor would turn to his ancient people and they would get the blessings he had in store for them. But, because the change in God’s turning his favor from Jew to Gentile was so great and important, it was necessary that this should be made plain to the believer, whether Jew or Gentile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul continually turned to the Scriptures to prove that this proclamation to the nations was to be made, and he produced evidence that some Gentiles appreciated the message of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus as clearly as the apostles themselves did. One of the passages quoted by Paul in support of his work of declaring God’s purpose among the heathen, i. e., the nations, is from the Psalms: “For this cause </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.” (Romans 15: 9-11; Psalm 18:49) He says that “Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision [that is, to Israel] for the truth of God, to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">confirm</span><span class="font8"> the promises made unto the fathers [Abraham, Isaac and Jacob]”. (Romans 15: 8) Those promises were, that in Abraham’s seed, that is, those according to the spirit, who were circumcised in heart, as in the case of those who are true disciples of Jesus, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">families</span><span class="font8"> of the earth were to be blessed. Hence Paul says that the work which Jesus did amongst his own people according to the flesh was, “that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.”—Romans 15: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That work was begun when the risen Lord set Paul to his work. It may be said that after the death of the apostles, though a form of organized religion began its corrupting work, yet a measure of true work has continued until this day. But it is evident that neither Paul’s work nor that comparatively small work which has been possible to the few faithful disciples fulfilled either the call which the promises of God declared or the prophecy which he quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We answer that the Psalm tolls of a conflict and a triumph, and that the witness to God, and the song to Jehovah’s praise, is because of that triumph. Paul’s quotation of the passage to prove his own work is not to be understood as meaning that he thought his work fulfilled the prophecy. There was no conquest of opposing powers in his case. He entered into a country unknown, and, it might seem to others, unaided by his God. If he sang in his work and about it, it was in such circumstances as when he was in the jail in Philippi as a prisoner, sore because of the beating by the representative of the Roman government. These pioneers were conquerors in spirit, but not in the sense in which the prophecy of the Psalm was spoken; and this experience of the chief apostle of the gospel to the Gentiles represents what has happened to the faithful servants of Jesus as they have witnessed to the nations of the grace of God in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to understand the Psalm it is necessary to look at the present relationship of the nations to Jehovah, the Creator, the Most High over all the earth, and to ask and answer some questions relating thereto. The fact is that at the present time, with a world population of 1,906,000,000, there is very little faith in God or knowledge of him, and that even then five or six hundred million of those profess to be Christ’s. These latter are almost wholly ignorant of the Bible, and are now turning away from it, believing that it is not a help to progress, but a hindrance thereto. So complete is the rejection in Christendom of the Bible and of the religion which it is supposed to represent, that there is now to be seen the fulfilment of Isaiah’s prophecy that “truth is fallen in the street”. (See Isaiah 59:14.) Men now refuse to believe that Jehovah of Israel is God, the Creator, the Father of Jesus, or that Jesus is the Savior of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This situation is not one which God did not forsee: he is not taken in something which he could not avoid. To the contrary, the Psalm from which we quote discloses the very condition which now obtains. The world is casting off that which it believes is the restraint of the worship of God. But it is not doing this only because it has come to believe that Christianity has developed into a great hypocrisy. Other causes are at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This condition leads us to the statements of the Bible which disclose that there is a great evil empire, controlled by Satan, the first rebel against Jehovah God. It has pleased God to allow that great spirit, Satan, to have a rule and dominion among men and over them; so much so that since the overturning of the kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, he has been called “the god of this world” and “the prince of this world”. (2 Corinthians 4:4; John 12:31) Of necessity it might be said, since God shows it to be the case, Satan has been the representative of the heavenly courts. He has used all his privileges to thwart the purposes of God among men, and through the centuries has succeeded in blinding men to the goodness of God. He has captured all the races of the world, and has used them for his own ends. Even the enlightenment which has come to men through education and the growing knowledge of earth’s powers has been used to blind men concerning their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But there came a time when Satan must be cast out of heaven. Then the Son of God made war against him. From that time, the year 1914, Satan, unrestrained by any sense of authority or of the limitation which God had imposed upon him, openly entered into conflict with God. His empire was brought under a closer organization. Part of it is invisible to man, but is seen by those whose eyes are open. Another part is very definitely visible: it is the great political, ecclesiastical, and financial powers of earth, the apex of that kingdom over which Satan has ruled as god. The kingdoms of this world, as such, have been under his control, and it is apparent to every one who will look that these three great powers in the earth are in combination to keep the present order of things in consolidation. This is Satan’s great organization which he has set with great skill for the purpose of determined opposition to the establishment of the kingdom of God in the earth. That great kingdom of evil must be conquered, and the Son of God goes forth to conquer it, for it stands in the way of truth and of the freedom of the people. Till it is removed the seed of Abraham can not bless the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul had no expectation that the nations of the earth would turn to Christ through his ministry as apostle to the Gentiles, nor that at any subsequent time, through similar work, they would turn to God. It was to the time when Christ should take his power that he looked for the enlightenment of the nations and for their turning to God. He it was who spoke of Satan as “the god of this world”. He therefore looked for the time when Jesus would destroy with the fierce ‘brightness of his presence’ all that stood in the way of the kingdom of righteousness. (2 Thessalonians 2: 8) He knew, too, that God had appointed an age for the reign of Christ, when he was to rule on earth in righteousness, and when he would bring the whole world out of its darkness and bondage into the light and the liberty of the love of God; when men should learn of God and learn to lova him, and so enter into life because of their obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The eighteenth Psalm graphically describes a bitter conflict. The Servant of God meets with strong opposition, so much that it would effectively stop him were it not that the power of God is with his Servant. Jehovah subdues the enemies, clothing his Servant with strength. It is in these circumstances the Servant of the Lord cries that he ‘will sing to Jehovah amongst the Gentiles’. We call attention to the fact that such a work is now being done; a work which when completed will have fulfilled the prophecy. God has now made known his truth about the present establishment of the kingdom. The prophecy is an assurance that all enemies of the truth will be destroyed. The enemies are those who, in places of authority and power in the earth, hinder the truth concerning God and the establishment of his kingdom, and who seek to keep the control of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That truth has gathered to Jehovah a band of faithful servants who, by declaring his purposes, are making known the glory of his name; for the name of Jehovah has been blasphemed among men, inasmuch as so many things contrary to his goodness and mercy have been ascribed to him by those who have professed to serve him and his interests. Thus at this time it is the privilege of those who are brought to the knowledge of his purpose to establish the kingdom of heaven, to declare among men the honor due to his name, namely, that he alone is God, that he is setting up his kingdom on earth under the rule of Christ his King, and that it is now the duty of all men to render allegiance to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This preaching of the gospel, the good news of the kingdom, has two distinct phases. It confronts the forces of this world who seek to retain their hold upon the people and upon the resources of earth, and it tells the peoples of the blessings which are coming to them through him who died for them and who is their Prince and Savior to deliver and free them completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The kingdom is sure; the days of oppression and of every hurtful thing are nearly run. The day of deliverance is at hand. This is the gospel of the kingdom which the servants of the Lord sing before the nations, and to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

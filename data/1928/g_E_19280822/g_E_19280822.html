<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Events in Canada </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">W</span><span class="font15">HILE the industries of Canada are expanding very rapidly, the coal industry here, as elsewhere, is having much to contend with. Editorially the Toronto </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font15"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“It is estimated that 200,000 miners are per-manentlv out of emplovment in the United Kingdom, as far as this industry is concerned, and there is no country to which they can go as miners, for the mining industry is experiencing difficulties everywhere. The concession made in railway rates in Canada is not only for the purpose of providing Canadian coal for Central Canada, but to give the miners of Alberta and the Maritimes additional work, and many units of the industry are in such shape that the Alberta Legislature at its last session passed a law to protect mine workers from loss of wages. The unemployment situation in the United States mines is becoming a subject of periodical investigation, without any signs of relief being offered.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Coal Mining a World Problem</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">“THE fact is that coal mining has become a</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J- world-wide problem. Competition is so intensive that business is going to the countries with the lowest production costs, while the demand for coal has not kept pace with general development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A.</span><span class="font15"> report issued recently by the United States | Department of Commerce estimates the world’s coal production in 1927 at 1,308,600,000 tons, as| compared with 1,241,700,000 in 1913. Continental Europe, where low wages and long hours prevail, increased its output in this period by only 50,000,000 tons. Great Britain’s production was 32,000,000 tons less last year than in 1913.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Even the isolation of Australia does not save it from the inroads of competitors. New South Wales is struggling with the question of providing work for idle miners, and it is noticed that the coal operators suggest either a bounty on exports or reduced freight rates, adopting the theory temporarily applied in Canada, that the troubles in the industry constitute an obligation on the State Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Incidentally, however, it might be mentioned that the State raised the wages of the miners to a high level, and added materially to cost of production. Besides this, however, the statement is made by the chairman of the Colliers' Association that South African and Japanese coals are driving the New South Wales product out of the markets and out of the bunkers of ships trading to and from Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“As in other countries, the use of fuel oil is affecting the Australian coal industry. Nearly half of the crude oil produced last year, it is estimated, was used as fuel oil. It displaced 155,000,000 tons of coal. Thirty-five percent of the world’s shipping tonnage used oil as fuel, as compared with one percent in 1913. Hydro-electric power is believed to have displaced 105,000,-000 tons, and as this form of energy is only in its infancy as to development the coal mines will probably suffer more and more from competition.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">the following news item from Paris:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Gardening with electricity, French experts of the governmental agricultural experiment station at Wagonville have succeeded in raising four bumper crops a year on the same plot of ground and in making fruit and vegetables grow to three times their usual size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The use of electricity instead of chemical fertilizers is still in the experimental stage, but France, Germany and Norway are making great progress in these tests and government experts predict that the day is not far distant when agriculture will be the most modern of all sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The principle of electrical fertilization is simple. At one end of the field, at a point facing approximately the magnet north, a small instrument is buried to a depth of about fifteen inches. Its role is to collect the telluric currents which circulate through the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“At the opposite end of the field is a transformer, embedded in the soil at the foot of a pylon, standing twenty feet high and surmounted by a fringe of metal prongs bent southwards. Beneath the soil, from north to south, is buried wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Great secrecy surrounds the nature of the principles of the transformer and the buried wires, but it is understood that a current of six to nine volts is obtained by the equipment, which is sufficient to light a small lamp. By the end of the next summer crop season, the experts will have completed their report and will then make public the details of this modern application of electricity to the oldest science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“At the Wagonville experimental farm, the electricity-treated field is surrounded with fields fertilized by manures of chemical products. At a glance it is easy to see how much crops benefit by the electrical treatment, for fruit trees in that area were bearing small fruit before trees in other fields had blossomed. The .electricity also kills field parasites.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">T IS good to see narrow bounds of nationalism being broken down more and more, and people of all nations, with the increase of knowledge, getting an international outlook. A short time ago a friend of your correspondent remarked, upon his return from South America, “When I left Canada for South America I thought there were only two countries in the world, Canada and the United States; but I have changed my mind, for in many respects South America outclasses both.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The fault, of course, lies with the educational systems of all countries which teach narrowminded patroitism. Regarding the many absurd notions about Canada the Toronto </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Star </span><span class="font15">editorially remarks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“It is apparent that some of the leading newspapers in the United States know very little about Canada. The excitement over the Bremen fliers has made this clear enough. Although vast numbers of motorists cross into Ontario and Quebec in the course of the year, knowledge about Canada spreads very slowly in the neighboring republic. The impression prevails that ours is a land of ice and snow, peopled by Indians, trappers and Eskimo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“When new<sup>r</sup>s came that the aviators had landed on Greenely island, with its ice, its snow and its isolation, the New York idea was that they were in Canada, in the midst of normal Canadian conditions. Reporters, photographers and moving picture men rushed from New York to Montreal and Quebec, dressed as much as possible like men leaving on an Arctic expedition. It was a treat to see some of them garbed for a spell of life on an iceberg, and armed so as to sell their lives as dearly as possible if attacked by the fierce and warlike inhabitants of Murray Bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Even Col. Lindbergh, one of the most sensible of men and one who has seen a great deal of the world from an advantageous height, was prevailed upon to strap an army revolver around his waist before leaving New York to fly to Quebec with a serum which it was assumed the untutored compatriots of Dr. Banting and the late Dr. Osler would not possess and perhaps had never heard of. The colonel was also given plenty of ammunition and two cartons of safety matches, but one of the New York papers was impressed by the fact that he carried no food. Boldly he set forth without provisions. There was, happily, no lack of food in the city of Quebec when he landed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Several times Col. Lindbergh has flown from New York to St. Louis, twice as far as his flight to Quebec, yet this shorter trip was regarded as a rush to the far top of the world. As the Ottawa </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font15"> remarks, the average man in New York or Boston would be incredulous if told that Greenely island is more than twice as far from Quebec city as are their own respective cities. The flight from New York to Quebec covered only about one-third of the distance to the remote island where the Bremen landed. Yet the New York idea evidently is that Greenely island, Labrador and Quebec city are all one and all alike in their wild and frozen isolation and desolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“To the average citizen of the United States all of Canada is so much backwoods and winter, where the mounted police put away their horses and drive dog teams hauling outlaws to log cabin court houses where bewhiskered magistrates with the butt md’of pistols rap oa pine tables for order. It is the frozen northland of the movies. When they- think of Canada they think to the tune of fiction and the movie's, quite apart from geography and fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The Toronto Convention and Tourist Association sent a man to Louisville, Ky., to induce a convention to come here, and succeeded. But some of those present were very much against holding the next meet in Canada. After the point had been settled one of the delegates argued it out with the Toronto man and, as a clincher, said: “I just want to ask you one fair question, How many of the six hundred men in that room, do you suppose, have moccasins?!’</span></p>

It will interest many of our readers to know that during the succeeding week the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Record-Telegram </span><span class="font15">contained the following editorial:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting at the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">O</span><span class="font15">NE of the most encouraging signs of the times is the tendency on the part of sociologists and human nature students in general to place the blame for most of the present “rattles” in the machinery of civilization to the abuse of the elemental word “truth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There appear to be two separate lines of attack. One is that one that is ever fearful that convention and orthodoxy will suffer if the bars are thrown down to abstract truth, and the other is that opposite line of reasoning that thrives best only when truth is halved, quartered or otherwise whittled to fit the exigency of the moment. Most of those latter incidents occur in that large vaulted room where we axe adjured to tell “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”, and reminded that we are commanded not to “bear false witness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Truth has had to battle its way to the light through a veritable Bermuda grass mat of cant, creed, superstition, convention and dogma, the while it has been constantly called upon to take the side of abstract justice that has permitted its presence only after it has been shaped by the lathe of precedent and made to come within the calipers of rules of jurisprudence which accents the practice to the detriment of the administration of our laws. That it has survived even in its present state of convalescence, is a great victory for the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Probably we are nearer The Truth at this time than ever we have been in the history of mankind. We have not developed a satisfactory set of harness for it, but we are recognizing the need for one. That is something we never have done before—as a whole. The stubborn-minded minority which refused to be practical at the moment of their earthly activities were the creators of that good dictionary word “martyr”. They still exist, except that we are not so rough with them as we used to be. A heretic -isn*t burned at the stake any more; If he can make his heresies splash loudly enough he generally succeeds in making a good living out of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Bebels” and heretics” are the “unknown soldiers” of the war of the intellect for the right to think. Every attacker of the rights of material progress has helped to bring the race, via the Great Charter and the Decla* ration that only was possible because of it, to the reali* ration of the need for free education and free religious belief. Every attacker of those inside barriers of educational standardization and dogmatic restrictions has assisted in the arrival of the people to the knowledge that He who created the human brain intended it only as a container which will, when it reaches its full growth, be a vessel which will contain nothing but the Truths of the Universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There never has been an epoch of history where truth, crushed to earth, ever rose with the rapidity shown today. Even while we are permitting inertia to handicap it, we recognize that the eternal years of God are hers. Wounded error does not possess its ancient snake’s tail that permits it to linger on until the sundown of the fallacy. The people of the world want the</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Truth. When we become a little less mentally lazy, recognize the Golden Rule as a business proposition and get tired of playing politics we will find, much to our surprise, that our brains are adjusted only to the activities of research and the storage of Truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">ERSONALITY is such an important word now adays in the vocabularies of even the unlearned that I have felt an increasing desire to learn what it is all about. I fain would try to comprehend it, but it seems to be fraught with mystery. I have asked several persons what it is, in their opinions, and I have received a variety of answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Each of these persons apparently has felt competent to define and expound it to me. I have been amused at the facial antics of some of the people as they began to talk on “personality”. Sometimes they hem and haw, narrow their eyes into mysterious slits, while their gaze seeks a corner of the room or a spot on the ceiling, they purse up their mouths and finally begin to talk in a slow, labored drawl that betokens a mighty wrestle inside their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Cautiously they begin by telling me what “personality” is not, or maybe they tell me some of its manifestations. Each gives the impression of talking on a favorite subject, one on which he is informed, but that the main difficulty lies in making me follow his line of thought, that is, to put the ideas into such language that poor little I can understand. Each seems never to doubt that he is one of the lucky few born with “personality”, although modesty forbids an open declaration of such a thought: this selfassured manner makes it apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">About the time I begin to catch something like a gleam of hope or understanding, I am simply squelched by being told that no one who is not endowed with it at birth can ever hope to attain it, and this is told me with such frankness and gleaming eyes fixed full upon me that I am sure that my informant feels no disappointment on the “personality” question in his own case. It is as if he had said: “My dear, I</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">—Ed.] </span><span class="font15">was born with it and therefore fully understand what I can only try to make clear to you; had you been so created you would not be driven to inquire what it is, but you too would understand it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Just how sbme of these satisfied persons reconcile this wonderful power of theirs with their mediocre attainments in life, I can not understand; perhaps they expect their “personalities” to function more satisfyingly in the future. All seem to think that “personality” is the open sesame to life’s prizes, in business, in love, in social success and everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A and B may discuss C, who is a man with a loud voice, who has a flow of language like some one who has swallowed the dictionary, who has a hearty laugh, stands with an erectness that suggests that he is about to fall over backwards, waves his hands with gusto, and gives the impression that he is “tickled pink” over everybody and everything and that he is the big-hearted thing that loves the whole world, but who, to the keen observer, gives an impression of craftily concealed selfishness, conceit and cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A and B are just as apt to disagree as to agree that C has “personality”, which shows the divergence of opinion among those who profess to understand the mystery. This jolly good-natured aspect is one of the common manifestations of this quality, according to the general idea; the possessor of it has such a harmonious life that everything just fills him with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Books on “personality”, will power and its uses, mental concentration, and other such topics, calculated to give the reader a short cut to life’s prizes, are on the market. It would never do to suggest that one must be born with these qualities in order to have them: that would spoil the sale of books. Rather, it is suggested that “personality” and the like can be cultivated. This contradicts those who hold to the idea of having to be born with it, but such differences and: contradictions always occur when no one knows what he is talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Personality” would appear to be a catchword that really means a condition of mind wherein all selfishness is developed in order to get what one wants in life. All this selfishness is glossed over with what appears to be good nature and generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some of the symptoms found in the self-convinced possessor of “personality” are a smiling face, hearty laugh, appearance of such- complete adjustment to life that one is filled with joy, just bubbling over with it, in fact, a ready flow of speech, wise-words, quotations apropos, witticisms, even wise cracks, (for the world likes to be amused). He always seeks to impress. Finallv some one “falls for this line”, and then *■■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">the individual gets the reputation for “personality”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">No one can continually dwell on the heights like the above: it is not natural. Such persons, underneath all, do not hesit ate to'use every hidden means to gain their ends; so that, after all, it is merely a case of concealing the most aggressive selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Now we have a greater thing than “personality”. It is a recent discovery or invention called ‘Tt”. This is vouched for by a writer on love topics; and having been the discoverer of “It”, she seems to be acknowledged by her followers to be the sole dictator $s to who has or has not this quality. We hear that “It” is extremely rare; not one in a million has “It”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Perhaps not one in many millions has “It”. 'According to the last information I have, only two persons have been acknowledged by this writer to have “It”. The followers of the “It” idea are no doubt waiting breathlessly for her whose sole right it is to name the “Its” to choose the next one for this illustrious group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We hear that “It” is personality plus, a sort of intensified “personality”, and that the possessor of “It” is a regular devil on wheels. (Pray that none of these “Its” come your way.) Sexually, it seems the “Its” are simply irresistible and they have a whole bag of tricks up their sleeves to drive you nearly crazy with their wiles and seductiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Even the “vamps” are going over to the “It” camp, it seems. Many people, no doubt, secretly believe they have “It”, just as they believed they had “personality” before “It” was thought of. I wonder whether any real follower of Christ w<sup>r</sup>ould be willing to have it known that he believes he possesses “It”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Did you ever hear any real Christian rave over Christ’s “personality”, as the term is now used? No! Christians talk of the spirit of Christ. If foolish people would forget “personality” and “It” and seek a right spirit, how much better it would be. A right spirit stands for what you have to give the world in the Christ-like way; but “personality” and “It” stand for what you can stealthily and selfishly wrest from the world for your selfish possession. Truly the w<sup>r</sup>orld is so drunk on silly ideas that it gulps down a new one every time it appears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After having read about “It” for the first time in a paper or magazine, it is amazing to see how<sup>r</sup> many people will* immediately talk about “It” as if “It” were something they had always known about. Idiotic drivel makes immediate converts where the iinmortal truth of the Bible goes unheeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For my part, I am sick of “personality” and “It”: they mean nothing more to me, when used in the popular sense, than the state of mind into which the Devil and his associates have plunged some people. To each it is insidiously suggested that he is one of the fortunate few having this imaginary quality, while his fellows are inferior to him, being without it. This tickles vanity, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A little flattery wins over a host. If all are one in Christ and all are made of one flesh, wdiat but Devil-inspired selfishness can make one individual want to continuallv outshine his fel-lows? This is Satan’s chief fault: he has al-ways wanted to be like the Most High Himself, and all his struggles are for that end.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Jehovah is God</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">A</span><span class="font15">NOTHER means the enemy has employed to cause confusion is that of instilling into the mind of man a misconception of God. Satan has caused some to teach that God is merely a blind force without intelligence; others, that God is merely nature; still others, that the great Creator and Jesus are one and the same. The truth is found in God’s Word alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There is but one First Cause: He who is from everlasting to everlasting and &quot;whose name alone is Jehovah”. (Psalm 90:2; 83:18) He, only, originally possessed immortality, “whom no man hath seen nor can see,” because He is divine. (1 Timothy 6:16) In His Word V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He states: “I am the Lord, and there is none else. There is no God beside me.” (Isaiah 45:5) “I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.” (Isaiah 43:11) “I am the Lord; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another.”—Isaiah 42:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He reveals Himself to His creatures by different names, and each one of His names is deeply significant. The name God appears in the Bible in connection with the beginning of creation. (Genesis 1:1) That name especially refers to Him as the Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of breath to all creation. “Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein.” (Isaiah 42:5) This name represents Him as the Supreme One and relates to His responsibility in connection with all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He then revealed Himself under the name Almighty God. (Genesis 17:1) This name first appears when God spoke to Abraham in connection with His covenant with Abraham. At that time God in substance said to Abraham: “I have made and do now make a covenant with you that you shall be the father of many nations and this shall be signified to you by your name, which shall now be changed. I am the Almighty God.” The name Almighty God was a complete guarantee to Abraham of the great Eternal One’s unlimited ability to carry into operation His announced purpose. Abraham was then an aged man. His wife was past the years of bearing children. God had told him that he should have a son by his aged wife and</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He in substance said to Abraham: Aly name Almighty God is a guarantee that this shall come to pass? It indicated the unlimited power of Jehovah. The name Almighty God signifies, to all who believe, that His power is unlimited and for Him to will a thing means that it shall be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Then God revealed Himself by the name Jehovah. The translators have rendered the name Jehovah merely as Self-existing One. It means much more than that. It signifies God’s purpose towards His people. God chose Israel as His peculiar people and Jehovah was the national name by which that people knew Him. He directed Moses to go unto the Israelites and tell them that Jehovah had sent him, and then His words to Moses revealed the meaning of Jehovah by stating His purposes. He said: ‘Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 6:6-8, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font15"> The name Jehovah therefore signifies to God’s chosen people His purposes concerning them and specifically His purposes concerning Christ Jesus and His church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Then the great God revealed Himself by the title Most High. This name or title signifies His relationship to all creation. It refers to Him as the Supreme Ruler over all powers and principalities. Anything and everything that is held in possession by any creature is from, and subject to the will of, the Most High. He is above all. There is none like unto Him and no power can prevent Him from carrying out His will. The name bespeaks supremacy, the One to whom all governments, powers and creatures must in due time be in subjection. He is the Author, the Maker, the Executor, and the Finisher of His plan. He works through His chosen instruments to accomplish His will and purposes. “lie ■ 'dwelleth not in temples made with; hands;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is a dishonor to His name and a reproach to His name to teach the people-that there are three gods in one or one in three. The great 'Jehovah God is completely separate and distinct from all. He is the Creator. All others are creatures, h</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>The Son</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">J</span><span class="font15">ESUS CHRIST is the Son of God: The name by which He is first known in the Scriptures is The Word, or Logos, which means the one who is the mouthpiece or word or speaker as Jehovah God’s instrument. He was the beginning of God’s creation and from and after that time was the active agent by which Jehovah God created all things that were created.—John 1:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Hebrew word </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font15"> is translated god. * . ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The great Jehovah is The God. The Son, the Logos, is A God. The name god is applied to mighty ones, even to angels and to magistrates. The name god is therefore properly applied to the Son because He is a mighty one. The name god is appropriate to Him because He is the agent used by the great Creator in the creation of all things: The names- Jehovah, Almighty God, and Most High are never in the Scriptures applied to Jesus the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jesus Himself testifies that He was the beginning of God’s creation, “the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” (Revelation 3:14) Furthermore He said: “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth; while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth.”—Proverbs 8: 22-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When the time came for the creation of man manifestly Jehovah God addressed His Son the Logos in these words: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” (Genesis 1:26) Later, when man had sinned and was to be expelled from Eden, manifestly Jehovah addressed His■ Son when He said: “Behold, the man is become as one of us, to-lenow good- and evil.* —Genesis 3:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Man stretches forth his aim to accomplish: some purpose he has in mind. The arm is a symbol of power used. It is also a symbol-.ofi power used by one through another. The Logos, the Son of God, is frequently spoken of in the Scriptures as the Arm of Jehovah. The following, scriptures-support this conclusion: “Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.” (Isaiah 40:10) “The Lord hath made bare his holy arm.” (Isaiah 52:10) “To whom is the arm of Jehovah revealed?” (Isaiah 53:1.) “I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power, and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.” (Jeremiah 27: 5) These scriptures show that Jehovah God, the great Creator, used another as</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">His mighty instrument by which He has carried forward His purposes. That great One who;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He has used as His instrument is His Son the</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Logos, Jesus, the Christ. Paul with authority from God wrote concerning Jesus as follows: ‘Who is the image of the invisible God, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the firstborn of every creature ’,</span><span class="font15"> for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they, be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.”—Colossians 1:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The foregoing scriptures clearly show the distinction between God, the great First Cause, and the Logos, the beginning of the creation of the great Creator. Adam, the perfect man, alienated himself from God by sin, and death resulted. God’s plan for the reconciliation of man was foreshadowed by the sacrifice of animals. These sacrifices foretold that there must be a sacrifice of a perfect human life. There was none in earth. God therefore transferred the life of His beloved Son from heaven to earth that He might be the One who should take away sin and furnish the basis for man’s reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Made Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">TN PLAIN phrase the Sacred Record says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us-, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” (John 1:14) That a babe was born of a virgin, Mary, at Bethlehem, grew to manhood’s estate and died upon the cross at Jerusalem, both sacred and profane history abundantly testify. Who was that man? The so-called orthodox clergy, in order to support their false dogma of the trinity, have been forced to accept from Satan and teach another lie, to wit, that the child born of the virgin Mary, which grew to manhood and was crucified, was God himself; that while on earth He was a spirit and that the body of flesh that He used was merely an incarnation of the spirit creature; that is to say, that God took upon Himself the form of man and went about in this body of flesh for thirty-three and one-half years, and that during that time He was known as the man Jesus Christ. Their contention is that by being born as a man child the second person of the trinity assumed a human body and that during all the time He was on earth Jesus was both God and man. Frequently, however, one of them says, “Jesus was very God and very man; he was God incarnate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It seems strange that sensible men could ever be deceived by such an unreasonable dogma. Note the absurdities to which such doctrine leads. The doctrine is: God is one, made up of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The logical conclusion then is that when God left heaven and took upon Himself the form of man, which form He assumed for </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">thirty-three and one-half years, during that time heaven was without God; therefore heaven must have operated itself. At the end of that period of time Jesus died an ignominious death upon the cross, at which time He cried: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” He did thus cry either sincerely or for a fraudulent purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Scriptures show that God is immortal and can not die; therefore the trinity incarnation dogma leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the so-called dying upon the cross was merely a sham and that Jesus did not d<sup>:</sup>e at all; and furthermore that the words of agony uttered by Jesus were merely a subterfuge to deceive the people. If the one dying upon the cross was really God, how would it be possible for Him to cry unto Himself: “My God, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?” If Jesus was</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God Himself and the Holy Ghost, to whom was He crying then upon the cross? When these questions are propounded to the clergy they look wise and say: “It is a mystery.” The fact is, it not only is a mystery but is a delusion and a snare and a greatly magnified untruth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Furthermore, if Jesus at the time He was on earth and at the time He died was God, then He was more than a man and He could not be a corresponding price to the man Adam. His death could not furnish the ransom price as the basis for man’s reconciliation to God. Again the “cloven hoof” of Satan the Devil is made apparent. By Satan’s making it appear that Jesus was God, then, the reasonable mind must conclude that Jesus’ cry upon the cross was a subterfuge, that there was no real purchasing value in His death, and that therefore the whole scheme is unworthy of the consideration of an honest man. The result of that conclusion would be to completely destroy faith in God and faith in the great ransom sacrifice and to blind man to God’s purpose and plan for the redemption and reconciliation of man. In view of the plain statement that Satan, the god of this world, blinds the minds of men lest God’s glorious plan should shine into their minds (2 Corinthians 4:3,4), it seems strange that men will continue to be deceived by such unreasonable doctrines as that of the trinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In truth, when Jesus was on earth He was a perfect man, nothing more and nothing less. Of all the names known to history, Jesus of Nazareth is the outstanding one. In the brief period of thirty-three and one-half years of His earthly pilgrimage He affected the course of the people more than any other man. The more intelligent people of the nations of the earth count their years according to the birth of Jesus. The record of this truly great man is found in the Bible. God through His prophets foretold the birth of this mighty One. (Genesis 49:10; Deuteronomy 18:15,18; Isaiah 9: 6,7) In due time God sent His angel Gabriel to Mary, then a resident of Nazareth, who told Mary that she, although a virgin, was the one of Israel chosen to be honored of God to be the mother of the mighty One whom God through His prophets had promised should come. (Luke 1:28-32) In due time the babe was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, even as the prophet of the Lord had foretold. (Micah</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">5:2) On the night of the birth of Jesus God’s holy angels bore witness thereto by bringing His message to the humble shepherds in the fields of the holy land. That the birth of this babe would have to do with the reconciliation of man to God, is testified to by the host of heaven which then and there sang, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” (Luke 2:14) God’s angel at that time bore witness to the fact that in due time the birth of Jesus would be good news to all the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The child was subject to His mother and Joseph His foster-father. There is no reason to conclude that the home in which Jesus lived was anything more than the ordinary home of the little town of Nazareth. Joseph His fosterparent was a carpenter, and what evidence there is seems to indicate that Jesus worked with him and was known as a carpenter. (Matthew 13:55) At the age of twelve the child came into some prominence for a moment. (Luke 2:47-52) Otherwise little is said of Him during the days of His youth. He “increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">At the age of thirty years, having reached His legal majority, Jesus presented Himself at the Jordan in consecration to His Father and to symbolize that consecration by baptism in the waters of the river. He was there a perfect man, holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners. (Hebrews 7:26) That was true for at least two separate reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">(1) He was not begotten by a human father but begotten in the womb of Mary His mother by the holy spirit of 'God. The Scriptures do not give the details of how, but the fact is stated that He was begotten by the power of the holy spirit, which is God’s invisible power, and that is the end of all controversy.—Matthew 1:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">(2) As a youth and as a man He had maintained His purity and had not sinned in thought, word or deed. Such was possible with Him because of His perfection. It is evident that the care of God was about the child and the boy, and when His mind began to operate and reason Jesus kept himself free from the contaminations which were in the world about Him. Those were thirty years of preparation for the work which God had for Him to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">His existence on the spirit plane had been transferred by His Father to that of the human plane. He was born a man child and He grew to manhood’s estate clothed with the glory and honor of a perfect man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When Jesus offered Himself in consecration to do His Father’s will He was then and there fulfilling what the prophet of God had before written of and concerning Him, to wit, “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:7,8) Then and there at the Jordan God gave proof of His acceptance of the consecration of Jesus. Witnesses standing by heard a voice from heaven saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” At that time God anointed Jesus with His holy spirit and outward evidence was given thereof to witnesses.— Matthew 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jesus, now the perfect man, stood before God His Father fully equipped, ready and willing to carry out His Father’s will. If the clergy are right in their dogmas of incarnation and trinity, why would Jehovah on this occasion say of and concerning this particular man who stood upon the banks of the Jordan: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am weH pleased”? If the clergy are right, then God was there again practising a fraud upon those who stood by. The clergy would have the people believe that there stood He who was God the Son. The clergy are clearly wrong. Jesus was not God the Son, but He was and is the Son of God whom Jehovah God had sent to the earth to perform a great work. Jehovah the Father loved His Son and the Son loved His Father, and the Father was well pleased with the hearty obedience of the Son. Here the Son had pledged Himself to do His Father’s will, whatsoever that might be, and the Father had received Him and accepted His agreement to do His will and manifested that acceptance by giving Him the holy spirit, and so testified to witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">HE clergy teach that the “Holy Ghost” is the third person of the “triune god”. The generally accepted thought is that a ghost is a spirit being. The word </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ghost</span><span class="font15"> in the Scriptures is mistranslated from the original. It is from the same root word that is properly translated,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ki nd, breath or breeise.</span><span class="font15"> The English word </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spirit </span><span class="font15">is properly translated from the same root.

It is properly called the holy spirit because all power of God is holy. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">holy spirit, </span><span class="font15">mistranslated </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">holy ghost,</span><span class="font15"> is not a person or being and no scripture authorizes such a conclusion. When God puts His spirit upon a creature that creature is clothed with power and authority to act as the representative or agent of Jehovah God. God put His spirit upon David, as His witness, and David said: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.” (2 Samuel 23:2) Likewise the Lord God put His spirit of wisdom upon men who were directed to build certain things in connection with the tabernacle. (Exodus 35: 31-35) These men were clothed with authority and power to represent the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The prophet, speaking for Christ, wrote: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isaiah 61:1,2) Jesus quoted this prophecy and applied it to Himself. (Luke 4:18,19) This scripture shows that the holy spirit is the authority and power God conferred upon His beloved Son. God had commissioned Jesus to represent Him and to speak with authority in His name. Again, says the prophet speaking for Jehovah: “I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.” (Isaiah 42:1) This was represented in the anointing oil that was poured upon the head of the priest whereby He was clothed with authority. Now Jehovah had placed His spirit upon His beloved Son, thereby anointing Him to represent Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Concerning the anointing of Jesus with the holy spirit it is written: “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” (Hebrews 1:9; Psalm 45:7) It is written: “Even 'Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the holy spirit and with power, who went about</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">doing good and healing all that were-oppressed of the Devil, for God was with him.”—Acts 10:38, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">R.

<p><span class="font15">These scriptures conclusively prove that the holy spirit is not a person and is therefore not one of the gods of the trinity. It is proof that the holy spirit (mistranslated holy ghost), is the holy power of Jehovah God conferred upon His beloved Son and upon others whom; He authorized to represent Him. These and; other scrip* tures expose the falsity of Satan’s doctrines of incarnation and the trinity and disclose • that the clergy have misrepresented the Lord God and do misrepresent Him,</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">ESUS was a perfect man and the only perfect man that ever lived upon earth, aside from Adam when he was in Eden. Upon the banks of the turbulent Jordan stood the perfect man Jesus declaring His devotion to His Father. There God put His holy spirit upon Him and clothed Jesus ■with full power and authority to speak in His name. There He was beginning His mighty work. -He was perfect, holy, harmless and separate from sinners. Of and concerning Him God’s prophet wrote: “Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.” (Psalm 45:2) He was the very embodiment of truth, meekness and righteousness. With frankness and boldness He spoke the truth. “Never man spake like this man.” (John 7:46) The reason was that He was a perfect man entirely devoted to the doing of Jehovah’s will and He came to speak the message which His Father had given Him to speak. “For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.” (John 12: 49,50) God sent Him into the world to speak the truth, and He did speak the truth. He said : “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) It follows then that those- who-contradict or deny the words of Jesus do nob speak the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Hear then the words of Jesus and- note that</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I ■' He brands the teachers of the dogma of the ?• trinity and incarnation doctrines as the sons ; and agents of Satan, the greatest liar that ever s existed. To the clergy of. His day, who then ’ refused to hear and abide by His words, Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">in plain phrase said: “If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:42-44) </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The clergy, who have taught and yet teach the trinity and incarnation dogmas, refuse to hear and obey the truth, and thereby put themselves in the same class to which the Pharisees were assigned by Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The trinitarians say: ‘God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost are one, equal in power, in person, and eternity, and are three in one? Jesus said: “My Father is greater than I.” (John 14:28) The clergy say: ‘Jesus was his own father? They do not tell the truth. The true relationship between God and Jesus is that of Father and Son, and this relationship Jesus always acknowledged. He said: “For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth.”—John 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Scriptures testify that God only hath immortality. (1 Timothy 6:16) That means that when Jesus stood upon the banks of the Jordan He was not immortal, and therefore not equal to God. Jesus’ own words are given as further proof that He was not His own father, and was not equal in power and eternity with God. “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.” (John 5:26,27) Let the people determine whether or not Jesus here told the truth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">and if so, then they must conclude that the clergy who teach the trinitarian doctrine are false witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">To the multitude Jesus said: “Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.” (John 6:27) Again,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He said to the Jews: “I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. They understood hot that he spake to them of the Father.”—&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">John 8: 26,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jesus repeatedly spoke of Himself as the Son of God, which proves He was not His own father. (John 9:35) Because He said He was the Son of God the Jews charged Him with blasphemy. The clergy of that time, as the clergy of now, would not receive the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Lazarus the friend of Jesus became sick, and news of that fact was brought to the attention of Jesus and He said: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” (John 11:4) When He had talked with the sisters of the dead man and told them of the resurrection hope, then and there in the presence of witnesses He prayed unto His Father and said: “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me, and I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.” If the clergy are right in their dogmatic teachings, then Jesus was there practising a subterfuge. His words show He was not practising a subterfuge, but He was praying to God His Father and He was there teaching truths concerning the resurrection which God had put in His power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When instructing the disciples concerning their privilege of prayer He did not say they should pray to Him as His Father’s equal, but He did say: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” (Matthew 6:9) “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” —John 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jehovah God is the great Life-giver to all that have breath. He gave life to Jesus His beloved Son. He sent His Son to the earth to lay the basis for the reconciliation of man to</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Himself and through the Son to give life to man. Man partakes of material food for the sustenance of his body. Jesus likens Himself unto bread, in this, that faith in Him and His shed blood, and faith in the work that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Father sent Him to do, provides sustaining food to man; therefore concerning the giving of life He said: “As the living Father hath sent me,'and I live*by^ theiFather: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.” (John; 6:57); This is further proof that Jesus is not His own father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jesus was with His disciples, teaching them concerning the way that leads to life. In order for any one to have life he must be reconciled unto God the Father. He said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) Thus He proved that the Father's way of reconciliation is through His beloved Son Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He taught His disciples that He must go away and that He would come again and receive unto Himself those who continue faithful unto Him and that He would set up His kingdom. His disciples inquired when that would be and how they might know. Jesus answered: “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only/’ (Matthew 24: 36) If when Jesus spoke those words He was, as the clergy claim, equal in power and eternity with God He would not have said that onlv His Father knew. His plain statement was that His Father knew something that He, Jesus, did not then know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When Jesus neared the time of the end of His earthly ministry He said to His disciples: “If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.” (John 14:15-17) In these words He clearly set forth the distinction between Himself, His Father, and the holy spirit. He plainly said that He would pray to His Father that His Father would send the comforter and that the comforter is the holy spirit, and that the holy spirit would dwell in His disciples because they were His and because God had chosen them to be His. He then pointed out to them that there were things yet that they could not fully understand but that they were yet to be baptized with the holy spirit and that then they would understand. He said: “When the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you unto all truth.” (John 16:13) The holy spirit was given to the disciples at Pentecost, as the Scriptures plainly set forth, and then the disciples spoke as the holy spirit gave<sup>1</sup> them utterance. (Acts 2:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That is the time that the disciples-, received; that anointing of the Lord) God. through: the Head,, Christ Jesus, and were clothed with; power and, authority to speak, and thereafter they, spoke? the truth with boldness and without fear.—■ Acts 4 :13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The time came for Jesus to finish His work, ■which the Father had put in His hands. Jesus, knew that He was shortly to be crucified. He-knew that He should stand before men as the-enemy of His Father, that is to say, that men would regard Him as a sinner and that He would die as a sinner. This was a great trial of suffering to Him. He prayed unto God His Father in heaven: “Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” (John 17:1,4) He had manifested His Father's name unto men. He was not seeking exaltation, but His great desire was to be restored to the* sweet fellowship and communion He had had with His Father. Therefore He prayed: “And now, 0 Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with, the glory which I had ■with thee before-the world was/’—-John 17:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">If Jesus was- then God, as the clergy insist, why should. He be praying to -Himself such a prayer? Either He did pray to Himself or else He was<sup>-</sup>practising a fraud. Whichever horn of the dilemma the preachers take they find themselves without support in the Word of God. Had Jesus been equal to His Father in power and in eternity there would have b^n no occasion for Him to; pray on this or any other occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Prior to that time Jesus had said to His&gt; disciples: “I and my Father are one. . . . Believe st thou not that I am in the Father, and;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto; you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.” (John 10:30; 14:10,11) These texts have been seized upon by the trinity teachers to prove-that God and; Jesus are one. Jesus Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">makes clear what is meant by the oneness of Himself and the Father. In His prayer uttered on the last night He was on earth, amongst other things He said to His Father: “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall! believe on me through their word; that they</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I. all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and 11 in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.” (John 17:20-22) Here Jesus was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">? praying for those who would believe upon Him . and who should be anointed as members of His body, which is the church. God gave Him to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• the Head over the church, that he and the h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">! church might be one. This was what He taught • the disciples, and that is what afterwards the disciples taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Paul wrote: “As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one ; body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.” (1 Corinthians 12:12) Paul gave an illustration of this, using the husband and the wife for that purpose. “But I would have you <sub>;</sub> know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.” (1 Corinthians 11:3) “For the husband is the head of the wife, even </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">as Christ is the head of the church: and he is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">the saviour of the body.” (Ephesians 5:23) \ With this illumination of the matter by the apostle we can see clearly what Jesus meant. As the man is the head of his wife, even so Christ is the head of the church. As the man ; and wife are regarded as one, even so Christ \ and His church are regarded as one. As Christ is over the church, even so God is over Christ; therefore they are all one in organization. The wife recognizes her husband as head, the church recognizes Jesus as the Head, and Jesus recognizes God as the Head. This is the thought the apostle further expresses when he says: “Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that 'which is to come: and hath put all things under</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">his feet, and gave him to be the head over all</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.” (Ephesians 1:21-23) Thus is proven the complete uniting of God, of Christ, and the church. By one invisible power are they united and therefore are said to be one in spirit. There is complete harmony between God the Father and Christ Jesus the Son of God and the church, the members</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">of His body. This is another absolute contra-’diction of the trinity and incarnation dogmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When Jesus was in Gethsemane, and knowing that He was facing an ignominious death, Ho offered prayers and supplications unto God His Father. He was not praying to Himself at that time. If the trinitarian s are correct He was praying to Himself and committing a fraud. If they are wrong and the Scripture is right, He was praying to God in sincerity and in truth. It is much better to trust the Lord God than to trust men. God tells the truth and His Word is true. (Psalm 118:8,9) Paul testifies that Jesus prayed to His Father and that He was heard. “Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.”—Hebrews 5:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When the mob came to arrest Jesus one of His disciples, in attempting the defense of His Master, smote off the ear of the high priest’s servant. “Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?”—Matt. 26:52,53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">If Jesus was then God Himself incarnate, as the clergy have told the people, and if He was equal with God in power and eternity, why should He give utterance to these words ? Why would He say that He could pray to His Father for help? Why not exercise that power Himself? Jesus always told the truth, and if He had been God He would not have there stated that He could pray to His Father and get immediate aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Why have the clergy ignored all these statements of Jesus and the apostles? Why have they seized upon a dogma or doctrine which they themselves can not explain and which no one can understand, and why do they insist on teaching a doctrine that dishonors God and destroys the value of the great ransom sacrifice ? There is but one answer: They are willingly or unwillingly the instruments in the hands of “the god of this world”, Satan the Devil, who has used them to blind the minds of the people to prevent the people from understanding God’s great plan of salvation and reconciliation.—2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Frequently the Scriptures use the term “The</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Son of man”. In order to understand the philo- Man to Jehovah and what He has to do with sophy- of reconciliation it is essential to under- man's reconciliation to God. This will be con-sfand the proper relationship of the Son of sidered later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">ABLY in June several Bible Students were arrested in South Amboy, N. J., for preaching the Gospel from door to door, offering the people, at cost, sermons in printed form—wonderful sermons, too—Judge Rutherford’s books. Several of them were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">At the hearing the city magistrate said, in substance, that the charges against the Bible Students would be dropped, provided they would agree not to sell any more books and would leave town immediately. Judge Ruther-for asked him to cite the law that they must stop preaching the Gospel or that they must leave town, and no citations were forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Judge Rutherford then informed him that the next Sunday the entire town would be canvassed, and eighty-four Bible Students accordingly showed up for the job. Nine young Christian women called upon the eight Protestant ministers and the one Catholic priest who dominates the town. The ministers were a unit in opposition to the work. It had hardly begun before arrests began, accompanied in several instances by the stoning of the messengers of the truth, both men and women. The police and their deputies arrested fifty-nine of the messengers of peace, hope and joy for the human family, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">paid no attention to the stone throwers. One of those who were not arrested sallied forth upon his motorcycle and succeeded in finding Judge Rutherford; and because South Amboy is near WBBR, Judge Rutherford decided to attend the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Bible Students engaged capable counsel, a Hebrew named Karkus. Mr. Karkus announced himself ready to proceed with tire trial; but the city was not ready, and postponed the case to the succeeding Tuesday after-- noon. Subsequently they postponed it to the next Friday evening. Still later they postponed it to the next Monday evening; and in the mean-time, R. H. Barber gave the accompanying discourse over the radio from WBBR, telling the people of South Amboy and of all New Jersey and most of New York state and other states what the arrests were about and by whom, manifestly, they were instigated. _____ *</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The hearing, Monday night, June 18, was a very tame affair. The magistrate reserved* decision, but those who were present at the hearing are of the impression that he is in about the same fix as a man in a parachute about a mile up in the air above the deep blue sea.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">N SUNDAY, June 10, fifty-nine Bible Students were arrested in South Amboy, N. J., charged with selling books and booklets from house to house without a license. These books and booklets are explanations of the Bible, and are distributed at cost price. No profits were realized by those who offered the books. They had but one purpose in distributing them, viz., to preach the Gospel, and thus to magnify the name of the great Jehovah God and acquaint the people with His plans and purposes. It can not be denied that this is a laudable purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is my privilege and pleasure at this time to tell the people just why these Bible Students were arrested. In doing this it is not my purpose to violate any law in what I shall say, nor to defy any rightfully constituted authority, nor to say anything for the purpose of offending any one. In using this subject it is not my purpose, primarily, to vindicate the Bible Students, but to vindicate the name of Jehovah God, and to show to the people the work that Jehovah is now doing in the earth, who are hindering that work, and why they are hindering it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sub>ri</sub> The World’s Only Hope</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">j His second advent. That promised kingdom is the hope of the world, and it is the only hope of deliverance from the evil conditions now existing. Among other things, it will deliver the groaning creation from sickness, disease and death. It will also deliver them from crime, wars, poverty, and from the grasp of the profiteers, monopolists and oppressors of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">That kingdom will bind the Devil for a thousand years and awaken from the sleep of death “all that are in the graves”. It will, in addition to these things, write God’s law on the hearts of all mankind, including those who will be living when the kingdom is established and those also who will be brought forth from the tomb during the thousand-year reign of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This is a beautiful and heart-cheering message. This is what is called the Gospel. The word “gospel” simply means good news. This is what the Bible Students are preachin and it is the message contained in the books which</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">they are distributing from house to house, without any other charge for their services than the bare cost of production and the expense of distribution. Bible Students are anxious for the people to know these beautiful truths, and they are willing to give their services freely that the people may know about them. Bible Students feel confident that when that blessed time comes, when everybody will be freed from sickness, poverty, death, and oppression of every kind, all the people will rejoice and be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is almost unbelievable that any one should oppose or hinder such a message of comfort and hope and joy. In addition to all this, the International Bible Students are absolutely confident that the time for these blessings to become a reality all over the earth is near at hand. It is not my purpose to try to prove these statements today; if any one desires the proof, it can be found in the books and booklets which the Bible Students are putting out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Christian’s Responsibility</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">sioned to preach those truths. He would be unfaithful to Jehovah God if he did not preach them. Furthermore, it is not necessary to take a course in theology, or to have some man lay his hands on our heads, in order to be ordained to preach. This theory of human ordination is as false as it is blasphemous. God alone can ordain any one to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Isaiah 61:1-3 we are plainly told who can ordain any one, and also what they must preach. Let me read it to you: “The spirit of Jehovah God is upon me; because HE hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” This is what Bible Students are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">To those who are His faithful followers the Lord says: “Preach the word; ... in season, out of season.” The Bible Students are trying to obey this injunction. In preaching the Word, we are using public discourses from public platforms when and where this seems expedient; using the radio to broadcast the message to much larger audiences, where this method is expedient and possible; and using another method which both Jesus and the apostles used, and which, even in our day, is the most effective of all, viz., going from house to house and telling the people the good news and placing in their hands books and booklets which they can read in their leisure moments in the comfort of their own homes without the necessity of having a collection box passed before them or of being dunned for a shortage in the salary of the priest or pastor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bible Method of Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">HERE is Scriptural authority for this method of preaching, and I want to read it to</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">you. In Acts 5:42, after Peter had been miraculously released from imprisonment for preaching the Gospel, he at once resumed preaching, not fearing the threats of his enemies, and this 42d verse reads: “And daily in the temple, and </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in every house,</span><span class="font15"> they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ.” Again, in Acts 20:20, Paul says: “I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">from, house to house” </span><span class="font15">The custom of building costly edifices, called churches, and inviting people to leave the comforts of their homes and come to this building </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font15">hear a message that is not comforting, that has no hope in it, no love in it, and that is not good news, is very rapidly falling into disuse. People can now sit in their homes and listen to the message over the radio, or wait for a Bible Student to call at their door and give them just what makes their hearts glad. The time is now here when they do not have to wait long, for there are thousands upon thousands of Bible Students spreading the glad message from door to door in almost every country on earth. The message that Christ’s kingdom is here, that blessings innumerable and almost incomprehensible are just at the door, is to go out until everybody shall hear it. It must go out, and it will continue to go out, and no power on earth can hinder it from going out, for the time is here and Jehovah God has spoken the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Bible Students know that their message is from Jehovah, that the time is here to give the message, and that God has commanded them to give it. The question now is, Have they a right to give the message, and particularly, have they a right to put it out On Sunday? Objection is made that in putting out these books on Sunday they are violating some law. However, no law has yet been found that so indicates.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>Sunday Set Apart for Preaching</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">B</span><span class="font15">EFORE looking at the legal aspect of the subject, let us look at it from the standpoint of reason. Perhaps many of this audience have never thought of the matter from this standpoint. Is it reasonable to stop the preaching of the Gospel on Sunday ? That is one of the pri</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">mary purposes for which the day is set apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">New Jersey laws, as well as the laws of every state in the Union, grant to citizens the right to preach the Gospel on that day, and do not specify what particular beliefs shall be taught, or in what way any denomination shall preach its particular beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Many of the denominations build large buildings adorned with costly steeples, organs, cushioned pews, fancy windows, and carpets; their pastors adorn themselves with peculiar coats and gorgeous robes, and go through certain ceremonies, and the choir sings one or two selections, followed by a fifteen-minute talk by the pastor, sometimes on the latest social scandal, again on politics, prohibition, war, or crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Seldom is there any discussion of Bible doctrines; and when the proper moment comes the pastor calls upon the ushers to pass the collection box and collect pay for his services— on Sunday, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Salvation Army, with drums, horns and tambourines, parades the streets, makes endless noise, blocks traffic, sings songs, kneels in the dirt and mud, gives a talk which it calls Gospel, and collects pay for its services—on Sundays, too. Does the state hinder or oppose any of these different methods of preaching the Gospel? I answer, No. And, of course, the state should not interfere.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Bible Students are Tolerant</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">INTERNATIONAL Bible Students believe that the doctrines and methods of all the denominations and of the Salvation Army also, are wrong. But we would not try to stop them. We would not be a party to any effort to stop them. We would not help enact a law to stop them. We would not make a riot and throw stones at them for doing what they conscientiously think to be right. We would not persecute them in any way. Bible Students believe intolerance is of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The question might be asked, Since you think their doctrines and methods are wrong, why would you not try to stop them? The answer is: (1) That it would be a violation of the fundamental law of the land, the Constitution of the United States, which constitution the state of New Jersey adopted in 1789. This constitution says that congress shall not make any law that shall interfere with the religious liberty of the citizens of the United States. (2) Our Lord Jesus did not try to stop those who taught false 'doctrines in His day, and did not instruct His followers to do so. (3) Bible Students desire to give to others the same liberty that they claim for themselves. To require liberty of thought and expression for ourselves and deny the same thing to others would be inconsistent, selfish and hypocritical.</span></p>

Is it reasonable to stop a company of Christian people from preaching the Gospel on Sunday, without profit, just because their methods of preaching do not agree with our own?

Moreover, those city ordinances requiring that canvassers shall secure licenses and that no canvassing shall be done on Sundays were never intended to interfere with the preaching of the Gospel; and those laws are misused when invoked to stop such preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In view of what has been presented heretofore, we ask: Why Were the Bible Students arrested last Sunday? Those people who read our literature like it. Those who condemn it are the ones who have not read it at all, or who have read it only in part. That the people like it is evidenced by the fact that over fifty million copies of the different books are abroad in the land, minus a few that some clergymen have induced their parishioners to burn. This latter number is insignificant, however, and usually the territory where a book-burning has taken place is much better territory when recanvassed; and when the people have bought the books a second time nobody on earth can beg or coax them to burn them again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Answering the question, however, Why were the Bible Students arrested? it will be necessary to go back to the garden of Eden to get a proper answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Origin of Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">HE Bible reveals the fact that God created Adam with the definite purpose in mind of</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">' toM Adam to multiply and increase and fill the earth. It further reveals the fact that God placed a bright and beautiful and wise creature called Lucifer over the first pair as a guardian angel; that Lucifer saw an opportunity to gain a kingdom for himself by leading the first man into sin and bringing upon him the condemnation of Jehovah, so that'Jehovah would reject him and his posterity. Lucifer succeeded in alienating the first pair from God. God condemned them and repudiated their offspring, and Lucifer’s name was changed to Satan. Ever since that time Satan has been the enemy of Jehovah God, the enemy of the race, a liar and a deceiver.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Satanic Deceptions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font15">HIS same Satan is called the “god of this world”. He is also called the ‘deceiver of the whole world’; and we are told that he has blinded the minds of the people lest the light of the glorious Gospel should shine unto them. Thus we are told that Satan is trying to keep the Gospel, ' good newsy from the people. How does he do this? The answer is, He deceives them. His method of deception is by setting up false doe. trines,i man-made doctrines; by teaching these false doctrines in schools, Sunday schools and colleges; by making them popular; by getting the people to neglect Bible study themselves and pay some clergyman to do the studying for them, and then to trust implicitly in what these clergymen tell them the Bible teaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This method of procedure has been in vogue so long that the majority of the people do not believe it is necessary to study the Bible. They have the thought that if they join some one of the many varieties of denominations or sects now on the earth, and pay some money into its coffers, they will be sure of going to heaven whether they study the Bible or not. This is one of Satan’s most outstanding deceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">For a person to point out this error now is to subject himself to criticism, reproach and even persecution. This, too, is of the Devil. Satan uses persecution and intolerance to scare the Lord’s people, if possible, and cause them to desist from exposing the error.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Object of Satan’s Deceptions</span></h5>

<p><span class="font15">filling the earth with Adam’s posterity, and so</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Gospel is the good news that Christ’s kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">is near at hand; that all the people are to be delivered from the power and deceptions of the Devil, from sickness and death, from wars, profiteers and all the false doctrines that have been foisted upon them for the past six thousand years; that all the dead are to be resurrected; that the whole earth is to be made like the garden of Eden, and that the human family will be given life, liberty, health and happiness right here on earth. No more poverty, distress, sin, vice, corruption, sickness or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The one sin of Adam brought the entire race tinder this terrible curse, and God planned a deliverance from it, and decreed that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, should be the Deliverer, and that the deliverance should be accomplished at the second advent of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This is what Jesus taught His followers to pray for, in that wonderful prayer which Jesus taught His disciples, saying, “When ye pray, say, ... Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.” A knowledge of all these blessings is what Satan is trying to keep from the people. He is well aware that if the people find out all his deceptions, his power over them is for ever gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">God told the Devil, in the garden of Eden, that there would be a ‘seed of the woman’ who would bruise the serpent’s head. “The serpent” means the Devil, and this text means that the time would surely come when the Devil and all his shams, frauds, hypocrisies and deceptions would be utterly destroyed. This is a part of the Gospel or good news, and hence we can see why the Devil is so much interested in keeping the Gospel from the people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Satan’s Destruction Predestined ■.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font15">HE apostle tells us that the ‘seed of the woman’ who is to bruise the serpent’s head, is the true church, and not any of the sects or denominations now existing on the earth, either singly or collectively. The Bible tells us that the names of the members of this true church are “written in heaven”, and that no one but the Lord knows who they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When the Devil heard the divine pronouncement against him from the lips of Jehovah God Himself, he at once began to organize the human race into cliques, factions, clans, sects, political and religious; to arouse their passions against each other; to plant the seeds of bigotry, prejudice, superstition, bitterness, ill will and. selfishness in every heart, and to engross their attention in the silly and useless work of contending for their own creed, their own government, their own political party, their own denomination or their own lodge organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">His purpose was to hide the light of the glorious Gospel from them, and he well knew that to do this he must so engage their minds in fighting one another that they would have no time to study the Bible and learn who their real enemy is. The result is that, in our day, very few people ever think of studying their Bible. No wonder they do not know that the Devil is their real enemy; no wonder that they do not know of the good things that God has in reservation for them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Satan Promotes Ignorance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font15">HROUGH these various competitive organizations, financial, political and religious, the Devil has succeeded in keeping the minds of the people from a study of what would be for their real blessing, and succeeded in making them believe that their real blessings would come from supporting these organizations of the Devil. Every honest man on earth knows that all the corruption, all the crime, all the oppression, all the graft and bribery on earth is associated with these organizations of the Devil; viz, the political, financial and religious institutions of the earth. These three great branches of Satan’s empire represent organized oppression. Only by keeping the people in ignorance and under subjection could the Devil control them and continue his deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But Satan had another object in organizing these institutions. All through the ages God has had His faithful representatives in the earth declaring His purposes as rapidly as they became due to be known, and Satan has used his rich, powerful and popular “trinity” of organizations, Big Business, Big Politics and Big</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Clergy, to awe, frighten and persecute the Lord’s representatives in order to keep them from telling the Lord’s message of hope, comfort and cheer to the people. In this work of frightening and persecuting the Lord’s people, the religious wing of the Devil’s organization has been the most wicked and reprehensible, because they have claimed to represent the Lord Himself; they had their Bibles and ought to have known better, and therefore their punish</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Satan Instigates Persecution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">ET Us notice what history reveals about these persecutions and efforts to suppress the truth. In the days when Jesus was on earth He was God's representative among men. He said: ‘The words which I speak unto you are not my own, but I received them of my Father.’ It is also written of Him that “the common people heard him gladly”. Again it is written that “never man spake like this man”; and still again it is written that the people “wondered at the gracious words” that fell from His lips. But while the masses heard and enjoyed the gracious message of a coming kingdom, with all its attendant blessings, how did this message affect.the religious element? Let us remember that the scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, chief priests and lawyers were the clergymen of that day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There were no Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Episcopalians or Catholics at that time; but the various sects or denominations were represented by the scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">They soon saw that if Jesus’ message was true, their message was false, and that they would be exposed as deceivers of'the people, lose their prestige among the people, be stripped of their power and incidentally lose their salaries. What did they do? Instead of having the honesty of heart and the manhood to acknowledge their fault and take their stand with Jesus, they instituted the worst and most wicked conspiracy ever formed by humankind to put an innocent man to death.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>The Clergymen of Jesus’ Day</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">HEY were the clergymen of that day, and claimed to represent Jehovah God; they</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">thanked the Lord that they were not as other men were; they despised the publicans and sinners ; they were highly esteemed by other men, admired, respected and loved by their fellow •men. Their fellow men could see only the outward appearance, but God saw their wicked and corrupt hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">With murder in their hearts, these agents and tools of Satan tried time and again to entrap Jesus in His words; they hired men to lie in ambush to kill Him. Their efforts failed for a time, because His hour had not yet come. But finally the hour did come, the hour foretold by the prophet centuries before, when Jesus would be ‘led as a lamb to the slaughter’, and when He, ‘as a sheep before her shearers, would be dumb.’ Those wicked, wolfish clergymen finally found a traitor among Jesus’ followers, one who would lead them to His favorite place of rest and prayer; under cover of darkness those religious hypocrites went out with swords and staves to arrest an innocent and defenseless man; they hired men to swear to lies to convict Him; they falsely charged Him with treason toward the Roman government, saying He was an enemy of Caesar’s government. Caesar’s government was the political wing of the Devil’s empire at that time; this political wing had more kindly and sympathetic hearts than did the religious wing. Pilate, representing the political wing of the Devil’s organization^ a heathen and not a believer in Jehovah God, tried to save Jesus; but those clergymen, with a wickedness of heart that is almost inconceivable, selfish, cruel and unjust, manifested the spirit of their father, the Devil, and cried, “Crucify him, crucify him,” and, “release unto us Barabbas [a murderer].” And they nailed to the cross the Savior of the world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>End of Clergy Rule Soon</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19280822_files/g_E_19280822-37.png" alt="" style="width:59pt;height:76pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">HE time is coming very soon when those wicked men will come up in the resurrection and face the people whom they have so deceived ; when everybody will know them as the ones that caused the death of the one man that ever lived who was willing to give His life that men might have life and have it more abundantly than they ever had it before. The Scriptures tell us that they will be ashamed at that time. In Daniel 12:2 we read: “Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We notice that Jesus when on earth said very little about the political wing of the Devil’s organization, but He did condemn the religious wing. With blistering words and biting sarcasm, hear Him tell them, “Ye are of your father the Devil”; many times He called them hypocrites to their faces; He fearlessly accused them of strutting around in long robes, of loving the uppermost seats in the churches, of doing all of their works to be seen of men, of devouring widows’ houses and for a pretense making long prayers. On one occasion they charged Him with blasphemy, and replying to their charge 'Jesus said: ‘I know My Father, and if I should say that I do not know Him I would be a liar just like you.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Now I want you to notice the situation today. The name of Jesus is honored among the decent people of earth; even those who do not believe He was the Son of God and the Savior of the world acknowledge that He was innocent and was convicted on perjured testimony. But how about those scribes and others, clergymen who instigated His death ? If they should be returned to earth today and should come to South Amboy, N. J., they would be detested and abhorred by all men. Their persecution of Jesus is acknowledged by all men as wicked, cruel, and unjust; but how few realize that persecution is always unjust, always of the Devil; persecution can never be justified under any circumstances. The Bible tells a Christian to love his enemies, not persecute them; it tells him to pray for . those who despitefully use him, and not to stone them. This being true, what shall we say of those persons who stoned Bible Students on Sunday, June 10, in South Amboy, N. J.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We can only conclude that they were instigated to do it by their religious leaders, or else “the god of this world” has terribly blinded their minds. Anyway, they were servants of Satan and not servants of the Most High God. The time is coming when they will be ashamed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Clerical Persecutions for 1800 Years</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">S</span><span class="font15">TEPHEN was stoned to death by religious bigots. It is estimated that down through this Christian era over 50,000,000 people have been done to death by other religious bigots. History records the fact that men, women and children have been roasted alive, torn limb from limb, dipped in boiling oil and molten lead, some have had their eyes gouged out; others had tongues pulled out, were crucified, guillotined, or murdered in other horrible ways. How ? At the instigation of the clergy. Remember, I am not stating fairy stories or mythological nonsense. I am calmly and dispassionately stating the facts as recorded in history. And, moreover, when these crimes were committed, history tells us that some of those clergymen looked on gleefully as their victims suffered the most horrible agonies possible for human beings to suffer.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Cause of Clerical Intolerance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">TT MIGHT be asked, Why should clergymen be so cruel and unmerciful? It would be natural to expect them to be the kindest, most generous and sympathetic people on earth. The answer to this question is this: All false doctrines are of Satan, and are designed for wicked and malicious purposes, and any man who believes and teaches the “doctrines of devils” must and will have the spirit of the author of those doctrines, who is none other than Satan. Surely this spirit of persecution is not the spirit which the meek and lowly Jesus manifested when on earth, and which He taught His followers to emulate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The most intolerant spirit has been manifested, and the most violent persecutions recorded in history were perpetrated, by clergymen. In our day these same clergymen are teaching a wrong conception of intolerance. When their false teachings and hypocrisies are exposed they cry, “Intolerance!” To expose false teachings and practices which misrepresent God and injure our fellow men is not intolerance. Jesus did it when on earth, and taught His followers to do it. The apostles did it. Indeed, no man can love God and let the name and plan of Jehovah be misrepresented. No man can love his fellow men and let them be injured by false doctrines and practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The man who exposes false doctrines, shams, frauds and hypocrisies is a benefactor to his fellow men, and God loves such a man. •</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Real Intolerance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">W</span><span class="font15">HAT is real intolerance? Real intolerance is to throw stones or clubs at one who is honest and conscientious; real intolerance is to start a riot, and throw bad eggs at one who is expressing his convictions; real intolerance is to make a heresy law and punish or excommunicate one who stands by his convictions of what is right; real intolerance is to make a sedition law and put in prison or execute a man whose conscience leads him to believe that Jesus Christ in the Bible commands him not to take the life of another; real intolerance is to lay a plot, or form a conspiracy, to catch another in his words, or to conjure up false charges and swear to lies or hire others to do this to convict an innocent man.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Modern Clerical Intolerance </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">\ ■.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">I</span><span class="font15">T MIGHT be suggested that the clergy of , our day would, not encourage persecution, much less engage in it themselves. But let me remind you that in the year 1918, during the great World War, International Bible Students could not conscientiously engage in killing their fellow men and they exercised their constitutional right as conscientious objectors. President Wilson recognized that right, and arrangements were made so that all conscientious objectors could engage in non-combatant service. The Bible Students had the law of God on their side and also the law of the land. They were entirely within their legal rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But what really occurred'? When Bible Students were drafted and called before the examining boards, invariably a clergyman was on that examining committee, and in hundreds of instances these clergymen ignored and violated the law of the land, became law breakers themselves, incited others to riot, and in numbers of instances led the rioters, thus violating the law of the land again. Both the God-given and legal rights of Bible Students were ignored, and the false charge made against them that they were hindering the draft; arid all over the country hundreds of Bible Students were manhandled, thrown into filthy jails, and persecuted in untenable ways, while behind this systematic persecution stood the clergymen of the country; almost a unit. The false charge that they were engaged in obstructing the draft of soldiers was also made against eight of the leaders of the I. B. S. A., and they were convicted on false and prejudiced testimony and sent to Atlanta under a sentence of eighty years each. After they were nine months in prison, another court reviewed the testimony, censured the trial judge who presided at the first trial, and released these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is not a disgrace to be sent to prison on false and perjured testimony, nor for obeying one’s conscientious scruples; it is not a disgrace to be stoned, as were some Bible Students in South Amboy recently, for trying to tell the people of the good things God has in reservation for them. Indeed it would be a ’disgrace to refuse to tell these things when one comes to know them; it would prove a man to be a coward, and a traitor to his God.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>More Intolerance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">I</span><span class="font15">N THE city of Boston, about a year ago, lived a Bible Student who 'worked among a number of other men. He told them repeatedly about the coming kingdom and its blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">These men enjoyed the message, but soon some clergymen heard of it and, fearing that they would be exposed and their collection boxes would suffer a shortage, concocted a scheme intended to send this man to jail and discredit the I. B. S. A. all over the country. The scheme was this: They persuaded two policemen to break into the man’s house while he was away and to swear that they found whiskey there. These policemen also swore under oath that the Bible Student had treated them to whiskey on one occasion, and swore to an exact day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Things looked hard for that Bible Student, but the Devil had not laid his plans correctly; for it so happened that on the day which these dupes of Satan swore was that on which they were given drinks by the Bible Student the said Bible Student was about forty miles away from home and engaged in telling the people about God’s loving plans and purposes. The Bible Student escaped by a margin. But were those lying, conspiring clergymen and their dupes, those policemen, even reproved for their dastardly plot? No, they were not; and it was impossible to even prosecute them,-owing to the protection afforded them by other clergymen and other policemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When the resurrection of the dead takes</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">place, all these persecutors of all ages will be ashamed, including those in Boston and those people in South Amboy who hurled stones at Bible Students; and also those policemen in South Amboy who refused to protect the Bible Students from the attacks of the mob and thus violated their oath of office. The policemen took their orders from the clergymen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Who Is to BlOme for Persecutions?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font22">A</span><span class="font15">NSWERING the question then, Why were the Bible Students arrested last Sunday? my answer is that, primarily, the Devil is to blame. He does not want the people to get the truth about God’s loving plans and purposes for the blessing of all the people; secondarily, those people who serve as the dupes of Satan in keeping the truth from the people are to blame; viz., the clergymen. You will find them behind every movement to hinder the preaching of the Gospel and to interfere with freedom of speech and lawful assembly. You will find them behind every blue law, heresy law, sedition law, and every sumptuary law of any kind on the statute books which infringes personal liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Up-to-the-M inute Intolerance</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">UT the question might be asked, Do the clergymen have this same spirit of persecution and intolerance in our day? In answer I will relate an experience I had with a clergyman following my lecture this afternoon. A “Baptist clergyman” from somewhere in New Jersey called me up by phone and threatened me by saying that if I gave a talk this evening similar to the one I gave this afternoon he would come to South Amboy tomorrow night (where the trial of the fifty-nine Bible Students would occur) with a hundred of his members, and every Bible Student would go home with a black eye. Of course his threats do not scare any one. I am of the opinion, however, that he can not get one hundred of his members to cooperate with him in such a cowardly work. I very much doubt if he can find a dozen of his members who will assist him in it. He might be able to find a hundred clergymen in the state of New Jersey who would be thus willing to violate the law of the land and the law of God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The very threat which he made places him in the same category with those who persecuted Jesus and the apostles. If this clergyman regards the I. B. S. A. as his enemies, why does he not follow the Scriptural injunction to love his enemies, to bless them who persecute? His language and conduct place him squarely with those who buffeted Jesus and spit in His face and cuffed His ears and then stood around the cross and mocked Him as He hung there in agony. Should this preacher carry out his threat he would become a violator of the law of the land and an inciter to riot, a criminal and a menace to the liberties of the people and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">■L </span><span class="font15">worthy of the name which Jesus applied to the same class of people in His day, viz., a hypocrite. I sincerely hope the gentleman is “listening in” tonight, and only regret that I did not get his name and address, so that I could give it to my radio audience. He asked me if I was not ashamed to broadcast all over the country that the clergy and the churches are a part of the Devil’s organization. I answered that I would be ashamed not to tell the people who God’s enemies are and who their enemies are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The history of the past and the facts of the present time clearly demonstrate that they are the enemies of the people, engaged not only in suppressing the liberties of the people, but in the still more despicable and wicked work of keeping the people from hearing and under-standng the words of the Lord and from learning of the blessings which are soon to come upon all the families of the earth. The civil authorities are deceived and fooled by the clergy into doing what the clergy demand, just as Pilate was used as the dupe of the clergy in his day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Broadcast These Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">DO not wish to be misunderstood in what I have said. I am not speaking from malice.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280822_files/g_E_19280822-39.png" alt="" style="width:32pt;height:75pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">I have no desire to injure any one. But the liberties of the people are being stolen; they are being deprived of the things that God intended for them, and the clergymen are to blame. Bible Students are the friends of the people and are trying to keep them from being injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Furthermore, please do not understand that I am complaining about these persecutions and injustices. I am not complaining. We expect them, and expect that they will continue until Jehovah binds the Devil for a thousand years. And when the Devil is bound that will end the power of the clergymen to longer deceive the people. Bible Students expect that the Devil will be bound very soon now and that the clergymen will stand exposed before the whole world in their true light as the worst enemies of the people, a scourge to the earth and a menace to the God-given and legal rights and liberties of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">“Behold the Lamb of God, ■which taketh awav z</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Now what do you suppose John meant when he said: “After me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me, and I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water?” We should all understand John’s meaning very clearly by this time. Let us think a bit. Why certainly, I knew you would remember it: i</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">John said, “After me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me.” Certainly, Jesus was long before John or any other person on the earth, for He was the Son of God, the Logos, who made all things in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Then John said,, “that he should be made manifest to Israel . . . am I come baptizing with water.” This is perfectly plain when we remember that John acted as herald or forerunner of Jesus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">So you may be sure that John was glad and happy to see Jesus there by the River Jordan. Jesus was now a man, nearly the same age as John, a fine, beautiful and perfect human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">John had baptized Jesus forty days or more before that, and immediately after this baptism Jesus was led by God’s spirit into the wilderness where he studied God’s Word for forty days and nights and was also sorely tempted by the Devil. He had just returned from the wilderness, now ready to begin His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What a wonderful sight it must have been to see John and Jesus standing side by side upon the tree-bordered bank of the Jordan: one, the dweller in the wilderness, whom God had raised up to herald that approach of His only Son; the other, that Son Himself, Jesus, who, as the Logos, had given up His high and glorious position at Jehovah’s right hand and was now about to offer His perfect human life unto His Father in payment for the perfect human life lost by Father Adam!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">W</span><span class="font15">E PROCEED with the story of John, the son of Zacharias, who, you will remember, was used by Jehovah God as a messenger or herald to proclaim the coming of Jesus. Jolin was also known as John the Baptist. He baptized in the river Jordan all those who would listen to his words concerning Jesus’ coming, and believe him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Pharisees, or priests and teachers, of Jerusalem were very anxious to find out for themselves if the sayings of John were true. Wonderful reports had reached their ears from people who had listened to John, tales of the young man’s fine appearance and gentle manner and, most of all, accounts of John’s sayings and doings at the River Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">These Pharisees had great power over the Jewish people because they were about the only ones who could read and write, and they pretended to tell the people things which, they said, were written in the books of the law which Moses received from God. But many of the things which they told the people were lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But the people did not know this: they trusted the Pharisees and listened to their words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Now the Pharisees did know a great deal about the writings of the holy prophets of God. They knew of the Messiah, or Christ, whose coining was foretold by Moses and Isaiah and, many others of the Old Testament writers. They seemed to feel sure that when the Christ should come, He would exalt them to high positions, of power over the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">So when the news of John’s appearance at Jordan reached the ears of these learned teachers and priests, they were quite interested as to how it would affect their hopes and expectations ; and so they sent some of their number to John, questioning him about his sayings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What John told them we already know, for we learned about that in the story before this. After telling them that he was not the Christ, but that he merely went before to announce the coming of Jesus, John went on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The very next day after his talk with the Pharisees, John was by the river Jordan, when he lifted up his eyes and saw Jesus walking towards him. John knew that now his part as</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

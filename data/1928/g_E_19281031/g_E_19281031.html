<p><span class="font0">A Few Facts About the Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N 1348 Europe was swept with, the bubonic plague. One-third of the population perished. There was a scarcity of labor. Wages of labor increased, despite all efforts of parliament to prevent it. In some respects it was the happiest era England ever knew, because work was plentiful and its rewards were good. When the workers are happy everybody is happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two hundred years later there was a surplus of labor, wages were low, and the law of 1549 enabled any master to enslave a worker whom he formally denounced as an idler. A worker who left his master for a fortnight could bo legally branded on the forehead with a letter “S” and made a slave for life. If he revolted he could be executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ruling classes of France and Holland passed similar laws in those countries; and in France, in the next 140 years, the burdens of the peasants were made increasingly heavy until the -workers were deprived of proper food, even the bread that they produced being taken from them, and the French Revolution taught a startled aristocracy that there is a limit to human forbearance. Today the Public Utility crowd are anxious to learn that lesson all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Poor Wages in Europe, Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE wages now paid to labor of all kinds in Europe are hardly more than enough to provide with decent bed and board and a few clothes. Life insurance on a large scale is not possible in Europe. The people have no funds with which to pay premiums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Europe a successful commercial traveler gets wages of $40 to $60 a month, a stenographer $20 a month, while a first-class mechanic may be had for $12.50 a week. In America building mechanics get as much for a day. Day-laborers in Europe average less than $1 a day. Their homes are devoid of all comforts. Running water is not common. Toilets are filthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Holland and Germany human beings do the work of drawing canal boats. The cabins of British canal boats are inconceivably small, yet they house whole families; and the total pay of the family, with all of them engaged in navigating- the boat, will not average over $7.50 a week, Human life is so plentiful and so cheap in Belgium and .Holland that it is a common sight to see women scrubbing their sidewalks and even the pavements in front of their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Europe has seasonal migrations of farm laborers on a huge scale. By hundreds of thousands they pour out of Poland and Italy into Germany and France, frequently taking their wives and children along with them for the seven months of their agricultural activity. Thus 450,000 Poles and 800,000 Italians have become permanent residents of France siiice the World War.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ONDITIONS in Asia are as much worse than in Europe as those in Europe are worse than in America. In India it is not uncommon for mothers to drug their babies with opium to keep them quiet while they work in the factories. The Shanghai massacres had their inception in the low ’wages paid in Japanese-owned cotton-mills at Tsingtao.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mills employ child -workers between the. ages of six and twelve. Wages are ten cents a day in Shanghai money, with twelve hours’ work a day for seven days in a week, with holidays on rare occasions. Children attempting to play while at work were beaten. Dissatisfaction with conditions at Tsingtao spread to Shanghai, resulting in the massacre of stu-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In Australia the white man comes in direct competition with Hindu and other Asiatic labor. Thus the Hindu working on a sugar estate in Fiji gets twenty cents a ton for cutting cane, while the white man in Australia, near by, gets $2.50 a ton; and the sugar is sold in the same market. Capital naturally flows in the direction of greatest profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Telephone girls in Bogota, Colombia, who did not dare sign their names, sent a request to President Green of the American Federation of Labor, asking the aid of American Labor in bettering their terrible working conditions and low wages. They charged their employers-with violating every labor law and threatening immediate discharge of any complainant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Early American Workers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">O THE English peasant of the earlj<sup>r</sup> seventeenth century, America was pictured as the land of opportunity. Many who lacked funds to pay their passage were induced to make the trip by captains who were in league with slave-dealers. Horrible conditions prevailed on the vessels, and upon arrival the poor victims were sold for a term of years to the highest bidders. Letters were intercepted, families were divided and hundreds died of starvation and disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The early Virginia colonies were prison-camps. The capitalists who financed colonization remained in England, interested only in the profits of the venture. We can not say much even now when we think of some of the prison-camps of the South.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the outbreak of the Revolution wages in America were two dollars a week: barely enough to keep a man out of jail. Indeed it often happened that when a worker recovered from an illness or an accident he was taken to jail for debts incurred during the time of his illness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the beginning of the nineteenth century the average wages in America were about $65 a year. The first strike occurred in New York city, where the seamen demanded an increase over the $10 a month they were receiving. The strike was broken up by a constable’s arresting the leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A labor contract at Dover, N. IL, made a hundred years ago, obligated every employe not to join any labor union and to accept such wages as the company saw fit to pay. They were subject to fines. Joining a labor organization resulted in discharge, with forfeiture of all back pay. Some corporations collected the preacher’s salary from their employes, and the company store was the only one allowed in the town. This is still true in some places.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The Value of Organization</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">HAT American workers have gained has come to them through their voting strength and their power of organization. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font10"> publishes the following amusing story as illustrating the value of organization:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sam, the colored driver of an ox team, saw a little lizard crawling up a tree. He flourished his long whip and very deftly snapped off the lizard’s head. Farther along the road, with skilful precision, he picked a horsefly off the fence with the same weapon. His skill as a marksman was next exhibited on a chipmunk that showed his ’head above the ground. A white companion finally said: &quot;Sam, take a crack at that hornets’ nest.” Sam grinned and replied: &quot;No, suh; no, suh, boss; them fellahs is awganized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The value of intelligent organization is also interestingly set forth by an editorial in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evening Journal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everybody admits that the bee is a good worker and that he works hard enough. But the bee does all his work in about four hours. .During the rest of the time he sits about, polishes up his legs and his body and reflects with satisfaction upon what a fine thing it is to be a hard-working bee. . He is able to do it because he and his fellow bees, all working, get all ox the honey that labor brings back to the hive. They haven’t got among the bees any collection of polite gentlemen in silk hats and large fat automobiles standing at the edge of the hive, or running a business office in one corner of the hive and taking for themselves so milch out of every load of honey that the bees bring home. . . . Bees, with their slight intelligence, and with no machinery but their honeygathering apparatus and their marvelous mathematical capacity for fixing their cells, and their instinct of brotherhood, are able to do for themselves, with four hours’ work per day, a great deal more than stupid humanity is able to do by working not only the grown men and women but the children themselves throughout all the hours of daylight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A writer in. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Equilist</span><span class="font10"> thinks that the early labor leaders were men of higher type than some of the present ones. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The early days of the labor movement produced great men. They differed greatly from the modern labor leader. These early leaders sought no publicity, they were single minded, not interested in their own glory nor their own financial advancement. They did not serve labor for pay. They made great sacrifices that the future might be a bit brighter for their fellow workers. The rank and file have let, their servants become their masters and dictators. The workers have now to fight not alone their exploiters but, likewise their own leaders, who often betray them, and sell them out, who put their own advancement ahead of that of the working masses, who make of the rank and file political pawns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">distributed among all workers. It is to the general advantage of capital to work labor as long as possible, so as to keep the line of applicants large. Every hungry man at the employment office is a menace to the workers in the factory. The fact that he is there keeps hours long and wages low, and that is what capital instinctively desires; and yet too many hungry and determined men at the factory gate endangers the whole structure upon -which our truly devilish civilization is built.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Market for Time</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10">MONG working men one constantly hears the expressions “full time”, “half time,” “'over time,” “'time and a half” and “douhle time”. Time is the thing the workman has to sell, and which he must sell if he is to live. But among executives one hears them discussing “labor”, “labor costs,” etc. They are not interested in what happens to anybody's time. What they wish to know’ is what will be the cost of labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The worker rightly fears any great increase in the amount of time that is offered for sale. Just now there are supposed to be about 40,000,000 workers in the United States. Let us say that among them they average eight hours apiece. Then it takes 320,000,000 hours of work a day </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> run this country as we are now running it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is best for the laborer when there are not enough workers of the right kind to do the necessary work in the regular time. Thon lie is sure of steady work at good pay and will also get overtime and extra pay for that. But executives would always like to see a surplus of labor iii the market, so that workers will fear to lose their jobs and be content with small pay-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Excessively rapid work cuts down the hours of work to be had. It is to the immediate advantage of the individual worker»but to the general disadvantage of his fellows. Best rioted immigration from other countries or from other parts of the country makes executives glad but affects labor adversely. The more women and children there are to tend machines, the less must eventually be tire pay of the men with whom they come in competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor constantly seeks to reduce hours of labor, so that the total work to be done may be</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Insecurity of the Workers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">HEN one considers the insecurity of the ' workers he can but wonder at their</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">courage. Their pay is not large. Even now the general average pay in the printing trades is but $33 a week, with, iron and steel workers averaging $30, workers in food establishments $26, leather workers $24, lumber workers $22 and textile workers $20. The general average in all six trades is less than $27 a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Workers are necessarily more or less nomadic, going from job to job, but the present effort of executives is to keep their men busy by stimulating sales and creating new markets rather than lose their skill and experience by, laying them off in dull spells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some advantage, both to workers and to employers, accrues from paying the workers in cheeks of $5 and $10 denominations instead of in cash. The payroll is less liable to be held up, bank deposits of employers remain higher, and thrift is encouraged in the worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nine-tenths of the wealth of Britain is possessed by less than one-tenth of the population. It takes a lot of explaining and explaining and explaining to explain why such a state of affairs should he suffered to continue. A brief explanation is that the bulk of it was gotten dishonestly or unjustly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Board of Directors</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">T IS hard for a board of directors to have any interest in or sympathy for an individual, especially one that it never sees. It is a little raw, perhaps, to say as did Karl Marx, that capital came into the world “dripping with blood and dirt from every pore”; but it is still true that heartless corporations remain heartless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The natural operation of the capitalistic mind was disebjseti in Philadelphia a hundred years ago when the present system of free public schools was first proposed. It was roundly denounced as impractical, as of class legislation and as placing a premium on idleness*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Today the board of directors hate? and fears thr labor union as it did a hundred years ago, and employs high-priced and very capable legal talent to encompass its ruin. Coal and iron police, “yellow dog’ contracts and injunction judges make a sorry wreck of tree speech, free press anil nee assmiiblairv, without which a labor organization is a helpless giant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The conscience of a representative board of directors was revealed in London where a fur skin dresser was required to work seventeen hours a day for eight weeks in lire height of the season and then was refused the extra pay which he had earned, on the ground that it would exceed the irmximmu rates allowed by the Board of Trade (the child of iheir own creation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A joker put the viewpoint of the board of directors as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are 365 day® in the year. You sleep eight hours, which in a year equals 122 days, leaving 243 days. For leisure and recreation you also have 8 hours a.' day, which in a year equals 122 days, leaving 121 days. There are 52 Sundays in a year, leaving 69 days. A hah&quot; day off on Saturdays the year ’round leaves 43 days. An hour and a half for lunch the year ’round will equal 28 days, leaving 15 days. Two weeks’ vacation takes 14 days from the remaining days, leaving only 1, and this being Labor Day. no one works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the modern curbs on the union are the so-called company unions (which are not unions at all), group insurance and stock ownership. Ownership of stock gives the worker the desire to stick to his job and suffer a decrease of pay rather than see the company fall behind in its earnings. Sale of stock before five years have elapsed usually results injuriously to the worker, through the loss of bonus or otherwise.</span></p>

Workers in compressed air get caisson disease. Electric welders have their eyes injured. G-r-tain industries have too much heat for health or comfort. Machinists are subject to boils.

<p><span class="font10">Every day in the year 77 workers are killed at their tasks, and over 8,000 injured. The United States Secretary of Labor has expressed the belief that at least eighty-five percent of these 35,000 deaths and 2,500,000 accidents per annum are preventable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In some states there is a measure of compensation for occupational diseases, but in thirtyseven states there is none. Conditions among workers in the canneries of Alaska are probably the worst with, which - workers under the American flag have to contend. Unbelievable filth, communicable diseases, narcotics, unfit food, vermin-infested sleeping quarters, gunmen, cheap cotton socks a dollar a pair, soap 25^ a cake, ami. restricted water supply, are some of the charges made against the canners, and. those are enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Mistaaffn# Zdewr </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of Compensation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">npIHE idea that workers are adequately .com-pensated for their losses is entirely misleading. No amount of money can compensate a worker for the loss of his life or the loss of eyes, lungs, arms, legs or other members of his body. Disease, suffering and death can not be measured in dollars and cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a matter of fact the compensations offered workers are very small. Thus, in New Jersey, the largest compensation a man’s family can get is $17 a week, no matter how many children he leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another sad fact is that out of $1,000,000 collected in premiums for compensation insurance, $550,000 went to the insurance company, $215,000 to the doctors and only $237,000 to the workers; which, when you come to think of it, is not<sup>:</sup> only absolutely raw, but as absolutely crooked as the domestic- rates of American electric light companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Workers need vacations. We give some timely advice of the United States Public Health Service on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A vacation should mean very different things to different classes. A clerk, for instance, should do something that would make him use his muscles (though not to excess), and an iron-mill worker something that would enable him to rest his. A girl who .has been typewriting or packing cigarettes or cooking in somebody rise’s home should use hex* vacation in outdoor sports, such as playing tennis or something like that. A tired wife and mother should rest by getting away from husband and children, soothing her nerves by chatting with other women, and having a few moments of genuine privacy. The tired business man of whom the papers say so much is not so foolish as some persons think when he goes to the theater to listen, to a farrago of nonsense; for this is the very antithesis of his daily work. . . . On the other hand, the farmer who works fifteen hours a day from, early spring to late fall might do worse than spend two winter weeks in the city, fighting off the wily “confidence” men and attending the movies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And more or less similarly for his wife. They would both get enough mental stimulus to sustain them through the laborious days of next summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some employers, Inking note of the need that their workers should get some fresh air and sunshine, are erecting their factories in open spaces, so that to them a little walk is almost necessary. Not a bad idea. that. And it cuts down taxes, too.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Piece-Work and Monotony</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">ILE charge is often made that the piecework system begets dishonesty among all employes, including the supervisory forces, because workmen, especially </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uh</span><span class="font10"> repairs, are tempted to turn out inferior work or turn in charges for work not done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is conceded that piece-work is monotonous. Screwing a nut on a bolt for an entire lifetime is a rather tame job; and yet such tasks exist in the great automobile factories. As mass production becomes more and more a factor of life in America there are fewer and fewer first-class workmen who enjoy doing a good job for the job’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Women can usually endure monotonous jobs with better grace than men. They have been known to work twenty years at the simplest mechanical operations and to express their contentment, and even happiness, at their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Plenty of work of some kind is not only good, but absolutely essential for the happiness of man. Little work or no work is the most killing kind of work there is. Even uncongenial work is to be preferred to none. The idea that anybody is in danger of overworking, if he takes proper care of his body, is a delusion. Men and women were made to work, but not to work without adequate food and rest and comfort. Worry kills more people than work. Thank God that the time is coming when the &quot;workers are going to be relieved of their worries. That will be Christ’s kingdom, for which we pray.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Toronto, June 11.—Commenting on the Kev. Dr. R. P. Mackay's report on church and life work, Rev. Dr. Salem Bland stated at the Toronto conference of the United Church of Canada today that in every part of the world today protestantism. is on its sick bed. “You can’t take up a paper today without finding evidence that protestantism is in a very sick way,” ho said. Dr. Biand thought, that too much attention was being paid to the raising of money and too little to spiritual things. Dr. Mackay’s report, which occasioned the remarks, was given this morning and expressed the view that civilization must either be mended or ended. Alarm was voiced at the growth of birth control, Sabbath desecration and companionate marriage. Doubts were expressed of the success of church union. By a vote of 94 to .86 the report was referred back to union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canada’s Air Mail</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">HILE Canada has lagged far behind Europe and the United States in the development of an air mail service, a beginning has now been made. Speaking editorially the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily ■Province</span><span class="font10"> of Vancouver says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May 11, 1928.—Air mail service for Canada, got away to a flying start last week, literally and more imaginatively, too. A mail and cargo plane flew from Toronto to Montreal in two hours and a half, and one from Ottawa in less than an hour. At Montreal they transferred their load to two other planes, which flew to Ehnouski, down the river from Quebec, where they in turn consigned their mail bags to the liner Eegina, bound for England. On the following day three planes met the incoming Empress of Scotland at Rimouski, and brought the mail on to Montreal. Thus begins the performance of the four air mail contracts, recently let by the Dominion Government to three different companies; and thus is set up a new landmark in the progress of Canadian aviation. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a beginning, and there must, always be a beginning; but it becomes us as loyal Canadians to be rather modest about these first air mails in Canada. Compared with the United States, or with Europe, we are years behind the times in this business. For two years now, the United States post office has been carrying letters by air mail from the Pacific Coast to New York for 10 cents each. In all the larger American cities nowadays, there are street letter boxes, painted red and white, marked “Air Mail”. A mail plane—still known as “Eddie Hubbard’s plane”—■ has been flying from Seattle to Victoria to pick up mail from the incoming Empresses for the last five or six years. It was as an aerial mail carrier that Lindbergh got his flying experience. It came to us with something of the surprise of a new adventure, the other day, to learn that Ben Eielson, companion and pilot of Captain Wilkins in his splendid achievement of the Arctic air passage, had been carrying air mail in Alaska since 1923. Air mail is long since past the stage of experiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">i? Now that we have begun in this business, better late than never, it is hard to put bounds to the possibilities of air mail in Canada. It seems to be a boon particularly valuable in a country of great distances and scattered populations. Only this morning, wo are told in the despatches that Mr. George Maclean, the new gold commissioner of the Yukon, has cut nine days from the customary time of his journey from Ottawa to Dawson City by flying the last 450 miles, from White Horse to Dawson, in six hours. We are told that the Cunard Steamship Company is considering a scheme by which mail planes will be carried on its liners, to be released when the St, Lawrence is reached. This would cut two days from the present time of a letter from London to Montreal. It ought to be possible, in the near future, to bring a letter from London to Vancouver in eight days—five days to the mouth of the St. Lawrence by steamship, and three days from there to Vancouver by airplane.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Hypocritical Disarmament</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">T </span><span class="font10">N THIS day of much hypocritical talk about disarmament it is interesting to note the ever-increasing zeal of the nations in preparing for war. In this regard a news item appearing in the Ottawa </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farm Journal</span><span class="font10"> under the heading &quot;Many Think Active Plans Indicate World on Brink of Second Huge Conflict”, is well worth repeating. It reads :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">London.—Is the world heading fast for Armageddon, and will this year bring us the brink of a conflict the magnitude of which will make the great struggle of 1914-18 seem almost trivial?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are questions which a great many men of wide vision are asking themselves. They are questions prompted by the enormous and, to some extent, secret preparations that are being made by all the great Powers today, some details of which are revealed below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently a great aviation show was held in Paris, most of the exhibits at which were frankly military or naval models—heavy battle and bombing machines, huge naval hydroplanes, dull grey, like flying torpedoes hanging under the body, and machines positively bristling with quick-firing guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">France is prepared to call up more than 5,000 war machines, apart from her reserves in civil air-craft and the potential weapon of her great manufacturing centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Germany has leaped to the forefront in the scientific development of aerial resources, and America is particularly active in evolving giant air weapons of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some months ago there were secret trials in the United States of a great night bombing aeroplane capable of carrying three men and four 1,000-pound bombs. Fully loaded, this monster weighs 16,000 pounds. It is constructed throughout of welded steel and duralumin, and driven by one motor of 825 horsepower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A distinguishing feature is a disappearing turret, which drops the machine-gunner and his platform two feet beneath the floor of the fuselage between the wings and the tail, permitting him to cover the ship’s rear completely. When unused, the platform automatically lifts itself flush with the floor of the plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is another gun turret on top of the body of the plane farther aft, and a machine-gun on the tip of each lower wing, firing straight ahead and controlled in the pilot’s cockpit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The new fighter stands 20 feet high, with a wing spread of 85 feet, has a speed of 110 miles per hour, and a cruising range of 500 miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One gas bomb of the type now possessed by a certain Power would, if dropped in Trafalgar Square, put out of action nearly every inhabitant in the heart of London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A high-speed race for naval supremacy is likewise going on between the nations. New types of warships vastly different from and more formidable than the old are under construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A </span><span class="font8">strange new ship is the British battleship Nelson, which has the largest forecastle in the world—410 feet long from stem to bridge. The total length of the ship is 702 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bridge is totally unlike anything hitherto called a bridge. It is really an armored tower of many stories and great spaciousness, and is a regular Bluebeard’s tower of secrets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next war will undoubtedly see the introduction of poison gas which has the persistency of mustard gas and the toxicity of phosgene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An American inventor has succeeded in trapping deadly vapors in a canister so small that every soldier can carry one without adding more than a pound or two to his equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By the exploitation of the gases developed since the last war it will be possible to render a whole army helpless for many hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Future conflicts may also see the employment of the televisor, which will make it possible to follow an enemy’s movements when he believes himself to be in darkness, for the invisible ray of the televisor gives the power to see in total darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Attacking aeroplanes approaching under cover of night will be disclosed to the defending headquar-ters by the electric eye of the televisor. They will be followed by searchlights emitting invisible rays, and as these rays will be unseen by them they will continue to approach until, without difficulty, they are brought down. '</span></p>

The immigration question is ever uppermost in the debates of the House of Parliament and in the public press. Americans are awakening to the opportunities</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Monday, May 21, 1928. Canada borrowed $268,000, 000 from the United States last year as against only $51,000,000 from. Great Britain. Up till the war period British, investment in the Dominion far exceeded American, but the position has since been reversed. United States capitalists have now about one billion dollars more at stake in Canada than British capitalists. The figures for 1927 indicate to what an extent New-York rather than London is supplying funds for new Canadian enterprises. There is no lack of money in Great Britain for investment overseas. In 1927 Africa absorbed $172,000,000 of it, more than three times as much as Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a little disappointing to Canadians that British interest in this Dominion has flagged in recent years, yet the preponderance of American dollars in the immigrant capital is no cause for alarm. It does not involve any surrender of Canadian sovereignty over Canadian economic policy. Nor does it foreshadow, as some have said, the absorption of the Dominion into the United States. M‘hny are inclined to forget that until recently the United States was itself a debtor nation and that Great Britain was. the republic’s principal creditor. A generation ago many leading American companies were chiefly owned by British investors, yet that by no means affected the political independence of the United States. Canada is passing through a stage from which her neighbor emerged some years ago, the stage in which domestic reserves of capital are insufficient, to finance development of natural resources. The source of the Dominion’s borrowings during this period is not of primary importance.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark95"></a>The Life of a Chinese Coolie </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Frank Bortlik</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">■</span><span class="font10">HE following letter was originally written by a young man who had a very good record in a nautical school and is now an officer of one of the large American liners. He wrote this to his parents regarding life among the lowly &quot;from &quot;the war-stricken part<sup>:</sup> of China to Manchuria, principally to find work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dear Parents: Tins has been.: my first opportunity to write to you since leaving Yokohama. We arrived here three days ago in a blinding snow-storm, and' due to an insufficient number of berths lay outside the harbor. It is freezing here always; now the highest temperature today is 32°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people back home may think that life conditions have treated them harshly. Perhaps it is so, but it can not compare with the. life led by a “coolie”. During freezing weather wearing clothes that are really rags; living or existing in hovels in which there is no heat at all; eating rice and thanking their god for it; working from sunrise to sunset in their own country, which is to a large extent, governed by foreigners, they are treated as dogs. A sign at the entrance of one, or I should say the only, nice park in the city reads: “No natives allowed”—a fine stata^o-i affairs when a man in his own country can not enter a park!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A ship arrived two hours after we had, loaded with deck passengers, meaning those who pay full fare but who stand on deck or in the holds. With the temperature down to 25°, the poor devils stood on deck for two and a half days—stood because there was no room to lie down, unable to go below the holds because they were packed like sardines down there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">•Coolies never wash. They can be seen in their off minutes (ton minutes a day) picking lice from their clothes. I. am not in the least exaggerating and I have seen this myself right here in Dairen. How they manage to live is beyond mev It is a secret which they alone possess. The Chinese “coolie” would rather sit and shiver in the cold than walk to where he might sfih ill warmth. ■ &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Their own ships are manned by Chinamen, but'officered throughout by English or Americans. The pay these men draw is enormous. How one man can regard a fellow being, with so little consideration as is given to these poor sinners, is beyond me! A “coolie” is not a man—just a piece of wood; no feeling or senses,&quot; treated with less thought, than should be bestowed upon the lowliest of low curs. How they manage to multiply, to ever .survive to become of age is wonderful. The stamina of the white man is lacking, but not here with the “coolie”. Why one should wish to live their life, even for a day, must be part of their oriental philosophy. I guess as I stand on deck myself, miserable with cold and fatigue, I can still feel compassion for these people ; and we are all given to pity ourselves to some extent I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every time a mate uses a ladder (of iron) after being used by a coolie, he washes his hands with a disinfectant, and needs to I</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font10">PENDING a few weeks in the quaint little village of Port Logan, in the south of Scotland, on the Wigtownshire coast, we heard that one of the chief attractions of this pretty spot was a pond where tame fish were to be seen which actually rose to the surface of the water and took food from the hand that provided it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With, curiosity aroused, we set out one evening' to investigate this wonderful thing. Our ■way led along by the rocky seashore for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font10"> bit, and then, entering the precincts of the estate of a wealthy gentleman of the county, we knocked at the door of a little cottage, wherey we were informed, the keeper of this remarkable fish-pond lived, part of whose duty it is to show interested visitors round it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Guided by him we found ourselves on the edge of a pond formed naturally by the rocks, but enlarged now by artificial means and so constructed that the incoming tide keeps the pond supplied with water, but also so that the fish once in can not get back into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this pond, which measures about twelve feet in diameter and is nine feet deep, are about fifty fish, mostly cod. We watched almost breathlessly, while our guide, who carried a basket of limpets in his hand, fed the eager creatures, which rushed to the surface and with gaping mouths received the tasty bite from the keeper, at the same time actually allowing him to stroke their backs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we watched, our pleasant-faced young guide explained to us that at one time the pond had been used solely to supply the people of the “big house” with fish, but that on discovering that the poor prisoners, compelled to rely for sustenance on the food supplied to them by band, were gradually becoming tame, the practice of catching iwh for domestic purposes was abandoned, and the pond kept purely as a curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He went on to tell us that through the constant unnatural exposure to the light, the ilsli eventually become blind, in which case they are removed from the pond and fresh ones caught and put in, the newcomers being directed by the &quot;old hands'* as to where they must now look for food.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">A REAL estate boom is one of the modern </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a*.</span><span class="font10"> wonders of the world (for the agent). Quite frequently it is mushroom-like: springing up over night. It resembles the •'‘boom&quot; of a cannon-cracker or the eruption of a volcano in that it shoots up in a hurry (sometimes unexpectedly) and also dies down the same way, leaving only a few scattered fragments'of the investor’s pocketbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes a gentleman has near an enterprising city a large piece of land which he can not or will not convert into a corn or wheat field. It may have a large pond in the center and a “hot dog” stand on one corner, that makes no difference. All he needs to do to make it popular and populous is to stick up a lot of street signs, call the land by a new name, buy a whole page in the newspaper, and presto! What a change! Instead of cornstalks, in less than no time it has produced houses and garages; and instead of the green banks of the pond, the erstwhile owner has greenbacks in the bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once in a while a man invests in a piece of land via the mail-order route. On one occasion a gentleman transacted a real estate deal in this way. lie bought a lot in a subdivision in Swampgrass County. He received a letter stating that his property was located at.the..corner of Waterlily and. Frogpond Avenues. A lit lie later when he&quot; went to investigate to see how successful his real estate deal, hid been, he found that the deal was real, but he could, not find the estate. He discovered also that what he.needed was. a reel and a.fishing line, because the fish refused to move out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a real estate boom is on, one is made to believe that “the land, is as the garden of Eden before him” instead of a desolate wilderness. Very frequently the prospective buyer is like the fly that was invited into the spider’s parlor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">■</span><span class="font10">E'W York does have a heart; at least some of its inhabitants manifest the possession of those qualities of which, that organ is symbolic. I came in on the New Yorker tonight from Albany. The trip wasn’t very pleasant. The train was too cold for comfort; it was very crowded and the passengers were getting-snappy. I was far from being physically fresh myself. I made the regular dash for the subway shuttle train so as to get to Brooklyn and to bed as quickly as possible, and managed to crowd through the door just as it swished shut. (The subway shuttle train doors are that way: they seem always to be closing in your face, or just behind your back.) The third seat from the vestibule was empty and I took it and set to looking at a newspaper sheet I had picked up on the train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Suddenly I felt a hand grasping mine. An old lady selling newspapers was passing through the car, and the lurch of the starting train had upset her at my seat. The hand was </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font10">pudgy one, but warm and soft; one thought that it might belong to a mother. Its owners face &quot;was kind and motherly, too. Rising, I took her firmly by the arm and placed her in my seat, with her stock of thirty-odd papers tucked professionally under her left arm. Too bad the jerking, swaying train had spoiled her business activities; but the subway is like that I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All at once the other passengers became ambitious to learn the news. (Tomorrow morning’s paper at that.) I was aware of a brisk trading going on right under my nose. And she could certainly hand ’em out, too! Nickels ■ were coming from all directions. The young girl on her right; two colored men across the aisle; the matronly lady in the corner on the other side; the lanky individual, who picked his way carefully from the middle of the car; and the young man with his fiancee, who chivalrously gave a quarter. “Here’s your change, brother!” she called, and the young lady smilingly approved her escort’s hearty “Never mind, that’s all right”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It’s a quick run to Times Square and she just kept her seat as the passengers filed out past her, every third one taking a paper. And then with a business-like gesture, she put her handful of silver into a paper napkin, probably picked up for the purpose at some lunch counter, and carefully wadded it tightly together. And as I watched her through the car window from the platform, I saw that there was an appreciative twinkle in her soft, kindly eyes. And it made me warm up and feel more kindly, too. She stayed on the subway, planning perhaps to dispose of her now- less than fifteen papers on the trip back to Grand Central. And I hope she did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Chukhnovsky’s plane was forced down, but he radioed the position of Mariano and Zappi to his ship, the Russian ice-breaker Krassin, and when the captain wanted to come and rescue him first he radioed back: “N ever mind us: save the others.” The Russian ship effected all but two of the rescues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To a country that could raise up a Sinclair, a Stewart, a Daugherty, a Hays, a Fall, a McLean, it is embarrassing to have such noble deeds done by a Russian.

<p><span class="font10">The above stock, other than the last two, is supposed to have been acquired at some cost; and when selling a margin of profit is considered, and sometimes allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the case of labor and self one hasn’t any plausible excuse for having these in possession; hence in selling no profit is considered. If any is allowed it is as a gift. But here is where expert salesmanship is most necessary, for the “prospect” is already well supplied with, the first above-mentioned stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those in possession of some or all of the first seven stocks mentioned have some appreciation of the importance of salesmanship, and here are some of the rules they practise: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Makum</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font10">AKUM is the key to salesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Make them want it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Make them buy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Make them like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Make them use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Make them buy it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those iij possession of only the last two stocks mentioned, labor and self, are beginning to realize the importance of salesmanship and are in some instances adopting the above rules of salesmanship and are trying to use them, for they are beginning to realize that very existence itself depends on salesmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This class is now<sup>7</sup> very rapidly coming to see that the first seven are what is referred to as “preferred” stock and that it is the last two that is the &quot;common” stock on which no dividends are paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These “common” stock holders are also rapidly coming to realize that this organization (“this world”) was originated and put over (“founded”) by an expert salesman and that all the “stock” is bogus and that all the stockholders have really been “sold” by this expert salesman, the Devil, and that that is exactly what Paul referred to in Romans 14:7, when he said “sold under sin”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many people are withdrawing from this world (the Devil’s organization); but for you who are going to stay in, your very existence depends on your ability as a salesman.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Bible Question and Answer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">/QUESTION.• </span><span class="font10">If the doctrine of eternal tor-merit is not taught in the Bible, why do the ministers teach it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">• Answer:</span><span class="font10"> There are several reasons why the ministers teach this unscriptural doctrine. One minister told me that he had to preach it in order to get people to join his church. Some ministers teach it because it is part of the creed of their churches and they would rather uphold the creed than the plain statements of the Bible. Some ministers think that they must be accountable to synods and bishoprics or higher churchmen, and foi’ fear of incurring' suspicion and losing their jobs they preach and support the idea of eternal torment.. Some preach it because they have closed their minds to any correction from the Bible on this question, they will not investigate, and they are willingly ignorant. There are also other reasons. On the other hand, the Bible is perfectly harmonious in stating that the punishment of the wicked who persist in their evil works is death, destruction, absolute extinction of being, as though they were not. In Ezekiel 18: 20 we read, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” In Psalm 37:10 we read, “Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” In Psalm 145: 20 we read that God will destroy all the wicked. It is. not reasonable to believe that both the Bible and the eternal torment- theory are true. The fact is that- the Bible, is true, and the eternal torment theory is absolutely wrong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ion which exist within the ranks of the ■<sup>:</sup>^8fei<sup>:</sup>''&gt;rofession<sup>:</sup> itself<sup>:</sup> regarding'the advisability of removing the tonsils, and leaving out :dfwhsideration''the many .and often far-reaching evils which follow the removal of these use-Mt and highly important organs, certain of our national health authorities recently broadcast the announcement that they had investigated all iides of the question and had found that reproval of the tonsils is desirable. They say that they have made observations upon the relations of acute tonsilitis to physical defects and disorders, and find that the removal of tonsils is beneficial and desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This announcement,' dangerous enough in itself, is all the more vicious because of the fact that it comes from a department of our national government; for people are inclined to look upon their government officials as more or less infallible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ It seems to me that these men have gone at this thing from the wrong end. I should think that the proper procedure would have been to reverse the process. They should have sought to determine the relation of physical defects to tonsillar and other throat affections, and also the relations of the underlying causes to all of these. They have placed the cart before the horse. They have the tail wagging the dog—a local effect of a general systemic derangement is elevated to the status of the cause of the derangement. Concomitant and successive effects of a common basic cause are regarded as specific diseases, and a cure is thought to be accomplished by removing the affected tissues. Chaos and confusion can be the only legitimate outcome of such mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I need hardly remind the reader that the tonsils are an integral and necessary part of that community of correlated and interdependent organs which we call the body, and that they serve definite and necessary and beneficial functions of the body. Their normal condition is one of health. Not only do they never become diseased without adequate cause, but they are as easily and quickly restored to sound vigorous health as any other organ or tissue in the body. Their removal upon any pretext whatever, and under any condition, is an unmitigated evil. A man only confesses his ignorance, or else he reveals<sup>5</sup>- his commercialism, when he says he</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">the tonsils constitute qnly a part of ■ tissue, and also that removal of the tonsils does not .remove the other affected tissues. ■Sbj-dvdh&quot; if we grant that the destruction of an organ or tissue is its cure, we arc still not curing the throat affection by merely removing the' tonsils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides this, tonsillar operations are always immediately followed by shock and depressant effects. There is danger from the anesthetic. There is’danger of hemorrhage, often, a fatal hemorrhage. There is danger of thrombosis (blood clot). There is danger of an infection to the lungs. Lung abscesses axe not uncommon results. There are the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ever</span><span class="font10"> present dangers associated with surgical shock. There are so many elements of danger associated with this operation that rational beings will seek a remedy for tonsillar affections through other than surgical means. Death from hemorrhage following tonsillar operations is far more frequent than is generally supposed; and investigations by one throat specialist in seventy-two cities in this country showed that these deaths are &quot;not reported as in any way due to tonsil operation”.</span></p>

Hever recently collected some 200 cases in the past ten years.

<p><span class="font10">A child is taken to the hospital in the morning to have his tonsils removed. He is brought home in the evening dead. This is an ever-present danger in all operations; and such results are more common in removal of the tonsils than the general public is aware of. The dangers are too great, as I have shown; and the promised benefits never materialize, as I shall show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical Record and Journal,</span><span class="font10"> June 3, 1925, Thomas M. Stewart, M. D., of Cincinnati, Ohio, discussing the “After Effects of Tonsil Operations’’, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The question has been asked: “Does rheumatism, return after tonsils have been removed?’’ The answer is, Yes. The reason for this ean be proved by Guy’s Hospital Report, 1923. Thirty-five recurrences of acute rheumatism were reported following sixty-six operations on children’s tonsils. And there were only thirty-three recurrences in seventy-eight eases in children on whom no operation was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May this be an exceptional record of recurrent rheumatism after removal of tonsils? The record is not exceptional; for another series of ninety-six cases of which fifty cases had had their tonsils removed, and rheumatism returned in twenty-three of them. And no operation was done in the remaining forty-six eases, and recurrence occurred in but fifteen of them. ... It may be asked: “'Of what benefit is the tonsil operation in second attacks of rheumatism?” The answer is: “'Of none whatever.” Why? Because in another series of forty-eight cases reported by Guy’s Hospital, sixteen of them had their tonsils removed and recurrences were noted in twelve. No operation was done in the other thirty-two-and recurrence occurred in only eighteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These figures reveal just what we should expect, namely, that removing the tonsils not only does not cure rheumatism but actually predisposes to its recurrence. They are many more recurrences in those who have their tonsils removed than in those whose tonsils are left where nature placed them. As I shall show later, the removal of the tonsils is the removal of part of the body's first-line defenses and cripples its resistance to disease influences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Stewart correctly reasons from the above series of facts that “this shows that the tonsil is of some value to the human body. Recurrent attacks of. the very thing for which. removal of the tonsil is strongly advised do occur. And these recurrences are more frequent in patients from whom the tonsils have been removed than in eases where the tonsils remain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Can it be that the experience of Guy’s Hospital is unique ? Or have other hospitals reported similar facts? It is not unique. M. V. Leof, M. D., of Philadelphia, in a paper read Feb. 23, 1925, before the Medical League of that city, says: “A. Report from Johns Hopkins Hospital based on one thousand patients examined before operation and one to four years after operation, is illuminating-; fifty-eight percent showed mouth-breathing after operation, fifty-five percent showed evidences of tissue left after operation; forty percent of patients operated upon were still subject to sore throat, angina being often more diffuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Tonsillectomy is rarely of benefit in deforming arthritis, never in acute chorea, rarely in acute rheumatic fever, endocarditis and chronic kidney lesions. It is not I who say this; it is a report from Johns Hopkins Hospital.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is usually assumed that “infection”of the tonsils always conies from without. But this is pure assumption. There is every reason to believe that it frequently, if not always, comes from within. Inflammation of the tonsils is not confined to the crypts and superficial structures, but often has its origin very deep in the tissues. The tonsils are commonly regarded as “portals of entry” of infection. Rheumatism and heart trouble, for instance, are regarded as commonly due to infection getting into the body' through diseased tonsils. Now, not only is the “diseased’’ tonsil a barrier against invasion, but tonsillar troubles are not always developed in advance of the troubles that are supposed to stem from these. Endocarditis may develop in a child ; then later arthritis; and then lastly, tonsilitis. Dr. Richard C. Cabot says that “such a sequence suggests that an infection widely generalized within the body has been carried first to the heart or to the joints and later to the tonsillar tissues”. On the other hand, we have many cases of rheumatism and heart disease where there is never- any trouble with the tonsils, and many more eases of chronic tonsillar troubles where rheumatism, heart troubles and other affections do not develop. Accepting the “foci of infection’’ fad for the mere sake of argument, we still have it admitted that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“As to removal of foci of infection, an evident state of affairs presents itself. The patient enters the scene with numerous joints swollen and 'distorted. The tonsils or teeth, the appendix or gall bladder, or what not, are studied and found infected. These foci are removed, and the condition remains the same. Each joint, and in one case as many as twenty, thirty or more separate joints are involved, each a secondary focus of infection, and each left remaining to reinfect new joints, and form still more foci. Obviously then, w<sup>r</sup>e are unable to do more than scratch the surface of the sites of infection, and the patient progresses, only too often, from bad to worse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The logical outcome of the surgical treatment of “foci of infection” in such cases would be the removal of twenty or thirty joints as well as the teeth, tonsils, appendix, and gall bladder, and the heart. A better plan would be to remove one joint from the neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have quoted at length from recognized medical authorities, not because their judgment is better than mine, nor because their experience is worth any more than my own, but to show that the medical profession is in possession of a wealth of facts which, if these had been considered by our health authorities, should have caused them to hesitate about recommending cutting out these important organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a means of destroying or detoxifying poisons of an organic nature which may develop in the body or which may be taken in from without, nature has provided the body with an abundance of lymph glands of a highly specialized character. In the throat is a 'whole nest of lymph-adenoid glands called tonsils. All along the alimentary tract are many lymphoid structures, such as Peyer’s patches in the intestine and the surgeon’s best friend, the vermiform appendix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The tonsils are simply a few of the many little patches of lymphoid structures which abound in the Body, and which have, as their chief function, the destruction of organic toxins. The more toxins there are in the blood and lymph, the more work the lymph glands are forced to perform. When they are wmrking to full capacity and there are still undetoxified substances in the blood, these glands increase their size in order to increase their capacity for work. This is called hypertrophy or cellular enlargement. Every functioning cell in the gland becomes larger, stronger and more capable. Instead, therefore, of enlargement of the tonsils’ being a danger to the body it is a compensatory measure and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font10">preventive of trouble; for, when the tonsils enlarge, they do so to increase their working capacity. If, then, they are removed, the work of destroying toxins falls upon some other lymphoid structure. This means enlargement elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Davis, a specialist of Roanoke, Va., says that in seven thousand five hundred cases of diseased tonsils and adenoids in school children, heart disease occurred in but a small number; and that large glands occurred just as often as before the tonsils were removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now we can see why rheumatism recurs more often in those whose tonsils are removed than in those who keep their tonsils. Removing the tonsils removes part of the defenders of the body. If you are vaccinated, or infected from a corpse or rotting meat, or if you are bitten by a poisonous insect, the lymph glands in the neighboring regions enlarge to increase their efficiency in meeting and destroying the toxins. Now suppose some foolish man were to come along and, seeing these enlarged and often painful glands, should advise their removal on the ground that they are a menace to life; would <sup>s:</sup>he not be doing what the physician and surgeon does in removing the tonsils ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tonsilitis is not a local disease, but a local manifestation of a systemic condition. Removing the tonsils to cure a systemic condition which has its cause or causes elsewhere is like the effort to dip a fountain dry without cutting off the source of water supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few years ago physicians developed quite a fad for treating disease, particularly tonsilitis, for sewer-gas poisoning. This was and is yet commonly regarded as an exciting cause of the trouble. And it is doubtless a correct opinion, only the sewer lies just below the diaphragm. The cesspool is in the stomach and intestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cold and &quot;wet weather are also commonly regarded as causes of the trouble. And it does frequently follow exposure to these. On the other hand, London had a tonsilitis epidemic in the summer of 1925. It w’as an unusually hot and dry summer. The weather, like other more exciting causes, can not bring on an “attack” unless enervation and imprudent eating have deranged digestion, impaired nutrition, and put a check upon elimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Medical men are quite sure that the disease is due to germs. But the germs are there all'the time and the disease is present only at times. According to the best medical authorities, one •''■attack’-' renders one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">more susceptible</span><span class="font10"> to subsequent &quot;attacks’’. Ono •'attack'’ doos not make . one immune. The immunity theory fahs down here as in colds, pneumonia, malaria, rheumatism, etc. But if one &quot;attack” does not render one immune- and the germs are- present all the time, why is not the disease constant? The an... swer is: Germs are not the cause of inflammation of the tonsils.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chronic tonsilitis represents a catarrhal state. In this condition we often see so-called adenoids, which is an enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil. A persistent low-grade inflammation is present. The enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil interferes with breathing, producing mouth--breathing. Mouth-breathing is usually overcome in. a week by natural methods. This trouble is also credited with being the cause of mental derangement and lack of bodily development. This is a perfectly good example of getting the cart before the horse. The causes of the tonsilitis are the causes of the mental and bodily impairment. Tonsillar affections are also accused of causing rheumatism and even tuberculosis. It is the other way round again: the cause of the tonsilitis causes rheumatism, in those rvith a tendency toward rheumatism and tuberculosis in those with a tendency to tuberculosis or those of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">scrofulous diathesis. </span><span class="font10">Chronic tonsilitis is due to the same wrong habits of eating and. living that cause acute tonsilitis and will gradually disappear as soon as these habits are corrected. So-called adenoids usually disappear in. short order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The catarrhal state and inflammation often extend to the Eustachian tube and even to the middle ear, impairing hearing. Sometimes adhesions form in the Eustachian tube, permanently impairing hearing. When these adhesions are broken up hearing' is restored. If no adhesions have formed, hearing will be restored when the inflammation and catarrh are overcome. This may be speedily brought about by a correct mode of life. It may be hastened in many eases by a fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tonsillar troubles are local manifestations of a systemic condition. They are the results of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">toxemia. Toxemia</span><span class="font10"> is a poisoned condition of the blood and lymph resulting from checked elimination and the absorption from without of toxic matters. Cheeked elimination is due to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">enervation;</span><span class="font10"> and this, in turn, is due to faulty living. Think of the utter folly of removing the tonsils</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">to remove a cause of disease which permeates the whole system, a &lt;*au.-e which saturates the tissues and fluids of the body and which is being constantly added to by the unphysiological mode of living, of the sufferer 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Practically all tonsillar troubles are due </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font10">toxemia (infection) of a gastro-intestinal origin. Ifernientation and putrefaction in the stomach and intestine, due to imprudent eating, give rise to the toxins that occasion inflammation. and enlargement of the tonsils. In children, imprudent eating is often the sole cause of the condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Children that are overfed, or that are fed on candies, sugar, syrup, bread, meat, eggs, or that are given too much milk, etc., are especially prone to have tonsilitis. Cereals with milk and sugar, or f ruits with starches and sugars cause enough digestive derangement to produce tonsilitis. Eating between meals is a frequent cause. The remedy for gastro-intestinal fermentation and putrefaction is not, however, to cut out the stomach and intestine, but to cut out all enervating habits and the imprudent eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tonsillar troubles in children usually end quickly when the child is placed upon a proper diet and all vitiating influences are corrected. In adults who have been troubled for years, considerable time is often required; but even in adults, persistence assures success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a good practice to begin such cases with a short fast or with a few days on a diet of oranges or unsweetened grapefruit and non-starehy vegetables for a week to ten days, after which begin to gradually introduce proteins and starches into the diet, avoiding, of course, all former errors in the feeding of the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AU other factors of child hygiene, such as fresh air, rest and sleep, exercise and play, sunshine and cleanliness, etc., should be given their due attention. The result is usually a rapid gain in general health and the disappearance of tonsillar difficulties. In a few cases the gain in health and the disappearance of the tonsillar troubles are slow, but steady. Operations, so far as my experience extends, are never necessary. They are not only unnecessary, but positively harmful. The removal of tonsils deprives the body of essential detoxifying lymphoid structures and also impairs the voice. It also holds out the hope of cure without correcting* the cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The wholesale mutilation of the tonsils is one of the unpunished crimes of the twentieth century. Such operations are confessions of ignorance. When an operation or a change of climate is all that is left for you, it -would seem that you might give nature a chance. What you need is a change of life. Instead of cutting out your organs you need to cut out your bad habits and substitute them with good ones. There is no more reason for cutting out an inflamed tonsil than there is for cutting out an inflamed tongue. The tonsil will get well as quickly and easily as the tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only recently a lady complained to me that she had had her tonsils removed two years ago but had continued to suffer with sore throat ever since. This is no unusual occurrence. To her question, “What must I do now?” I replied: “The next thing to do is to have your throat removed.” Another lady consulted me recently whose tonsils were removed two years ago. The pain and inflammation in her throat has been so great since, and the enlargement of the lymph glands and her neck so troublesome, that she finally came to believe that she had cancer of the throat. An examination showed also adenoid enlargement. On a corrected diet she is improving and will soon be in good health. But her health can never be as good as it could be if she still had her tonsils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who have tonsilitis will continue to have frequent “attacks” until they clean out the sub-diaphragmatic cesspool and learn to live properly. Imprudent eating will have to be given up and proper eating followed. Cutting out the tonsils is a childish procedure. It “cures” tonsilitis for ever, but it does not restore health. It can not cut out the enervation and toxemia. It can not restore digestion to normal nor improve elimination. Only those who are ignorant of cause will be guilty of advocating excision of the tonsils. Only those who assume that ignorance of function is proof of lack of function will declare that the tonsils are useless and that no harm results from their removal,</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font10">NE of our valued Canadian subscribers, H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J. Grover, a resident of London, Canada, sends us two clippings from the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span><span class="font10"> They- are of the same date, May 19, and because they contain a comical illustration of some, parsons caught lying, doctoring up their reports, so as to keep their bread tickets validated, Herr Grover wrote a letter to the editor of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Press,</span><span class="font10"> calling his attention to the discrepancies. Of course the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font10"> editor discreetly dodged the truth by shying his letter into the -waste basket, but it is written so entertainingly that we take great pleasure in publishing a copy of it here-with, as we know all our readers are interested in knowing ho-w much it costs to get saved in London, or, vice versa, ho-w much it costs to get started ballyhack for hell. It is a complicated problem, but Monsieur Grover handles it well:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“'May 19 issue of your estimable paper gave reports of United Church of Canada achievements of the past nine-month period. The figures are very interesting. How many people, even in the United Church, gave them even casual attention? They give us a good idea of the vast amount of money and energy expended in the effort, to make us all Christians and thus get us all into heaven for sure. Or is that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">object? If not, what is it? and if success does not attend those efforts, 'what? Then where do we go from there? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It is quite evident that only a small percentage of Canada’s population are numbered in the conventional sheepfold of the orthodox Christian Church. These are some questions that come to my mind, but the one that has bothered me most these ten days and now’ prompts this letter is occasioned by the variation in the two reports of your May 19 issue. One is a pre-conference report, and perhaps -was not intended for publication. Accidents 'will happen! In that report London district is said to have a “net membership of 83,605”, which is 1,016 less than reported a year ago. By the time that report got to conrerence, it seemed to have received some magic touch, for presto! we find that London has gained 1,171 members. Did the same arithmeticians who fixed up the doctrine of the trinity get out this report? The threc-times-one-are-one, and on e-times-one-are-three method of reckoning is the only way I can account for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Well, suppose it’s a mistake or misprint or that I’m too dumb to understand plain figures, and that the fact is a gain of 1,171 members for the London conference, still other questions arise. You know they say it is easy for a fool to </span><span class="font9">ask </span><span class="font10">questions. I count it an honor to be one of those. (L Cor. 3:18) What 1“ am wondering is, </span><span class="font9">Are </span><span class="font10">the results worth the money and labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The total gain of souls (elusive thing) for Canada is shown as 14, 485 for nine months. The grand total of givings was $13,241,176 for nine months. This works out at $914.15 per convert. Or, taking the London conference gain of 1,171 souls (nothing said about bodies) and London conference receipts were $1,473,772. That, according to my reckoning, makes the London district souls cost about $1,256 apiece. But, say, what a sinking feeling it gives me! Suppose the other report is true, and it was a loss to London conference of 1,016 souls. Awful thought! It cost $1,450 apiece to lose them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Of course this does not take into account the $85,254,934 tied up in church property. Maybe if that amount were put into some productive honest business it would keep many'more than 14,485 souls from going to hell. While in London conference there is shown a total sum of $385.-062 in paid-off mortgages, organs and pianos, church and school repairs and new buildings, we fnul nearly a third of that amount, namely, $109,339 devoted to manses and parsonages, furnishings for manses and increases in minister’s salaries. Can you tell me, Mr. Editor, how much of the thirteen odd million would be left after there was taken away the ministers' salaries (not reported), expenses for manses and furnishings and other things necessary for them to have a place to lay their head! And thee— but I guess there’s no end to my questions. But if you or your readers will answer these few for me, I’ll try to be. satisfied for a while anyway.</span></p>

This was up till then the longest English word ever used (29 letters). Of late years, however, another compound word from the same root has come into more general use in the form ‘interdenominational’, and in the S. S. M. Quarterly for June, 1927, appears the sentence: ‘That is why some people profess themselves to be antiintei’denominationalistic-ally inclined.’ Here we have in print a word of thirty-two letters, which is a genuine word, not a fake or made up in any way, but a word expressing an idea which can not be so well expressed either by any other word or even by a combination of words.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford. }</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font10">ANY ask' why God has permitted such confusion amongst men concerning the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The answer is that long centuries ago manturned to evil. God could have restrained the evil one and the evil influence over man, but His wisdom dictated that He should permit man to have a full and complete lesson in the baneful effects of sin. Man has been able by experience to learn that the natural tendency of humankind is downward. Most men have been induced to believe that there was no hope for the human race ever to be better. The long experience is sufficient to convince any intelligent creature that it never would grow better unless Jehovah would exercise His power in behalf of man. Others ask, Then why does God at this time permit the people to gain such knowledge of the truth? The answer is that it is God’s due time that the people shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long ago He declared in His Word that in due time the truth should be testified to all. The only purpose of this station’s broadcasting lectures, the only purpose of our giving lectures on the Bible, is to aid the people to get the truth because it is God’s due time. In the preceding lectures upon this subject of reconciliation we have learned that man originally was perfect, that he became a sinner and a pauper, that God’s purpose is to reconcile man to Himself, that Jehovah is the great Author of reconciliation, that Jehovah is the only true God; and now we will consider the true relationship of the Son of man to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The great array of Scriptural testimony proven beyond a doubt that the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation; that it was the will of God that man should be ransomed from death and the grave; that God’s love prompted Him to make this provision for man’s reconciliation; that there could be no reconciliation except this be done in perfect accord with justice; that justice could be met only by the sacrifice of a perfect human, life; that if Adam and his race was to be released another perfect man must take Adam’s place as a substitute in death; that in the earth there was no perfect man; that God transferred the life of the Logos from the spirit to the human plane and made Him a man and nothing more than a man; that Jesus was born of a woman hut not begotten of a man but was</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">begotten by the power of God, the holy spirit; that He was therefore perfect, holy, harmless and separate from sinners, and that God made Him thus in order that He might become the Ransomer and Redeemer of mankind, to the end that the people might have life.—MatL..20<sub>:</sub>;23; John 10:1(). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the titles of the Lord Jesus is “the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Son of man”. The correct translation of this text should be in. the emphatic form, to wit, “the Son of the man.” This title is another evidence of Jesus’ relationship to God and to the plan, of redemption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Adam was a perfect man, created by the great God, and placed on earth. As a perfect man he was given dominion over all things of the earth. All these things Adam lost by reason of his disobedience. Jesus, being a perfect man, made so for the purpose of redeeming mankind, must be exactly equal to the perfect man in Eden and therefore become the rightful owner of all things that belonged to the perfect man Adam. God therefore gave His beloved Son the title “The Son of the man”, which title signifies that He is entitled to everything to which the perfect man could hold title. This is another proof that when on earth He was a perfect man, nothing more and nothing less, and therefore possessed • all the qualifications to become the ransomer of Adam and his offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From and after the time He was anointed at the Jordan He bore the title Christ. “Christ” means anointed One of God. At the time He was anointed, Jesus was given the promise of immortality and the divine nature. His faithfulness in the performance of the work which His Father had given him to ?do would guarantee Jesus that great reward. The perfect man Jesus died, and that perfect life laid down in death corresponded exactly to the perfect human life of Adam which he possessed beformhe sinned. The man Jesus Christ, the anointed. One, therefore became the substitute in. death for Adam the sinner. Jesus was not a sinner, yet He was required to take the sinner’s place and die as though He were a sinner, that He might meet all the requirements of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus was dead and in hell for three days. &lt;&nbsp;Prior to that time the prophet of God had written of and concerning him: “For thomwiltmofr leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” (Ps. 16:10,11; Acts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font10"> 30, 33) Three days after His death His Father, God, raised Him up out of death. Had Jesus been God He would have raised Himself. If Jesus was God, then for three days the universe was without a God. It therefore follows that the Trinitarians do not tell the truth; otherwise, for three days there was no God in existence. The Trinitarians are wrong. The divine record concerning the raising up of Jesus is: ‘■'God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all tilings which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openlv.”—Acts 10: 38-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Call to mind that Jesus stated that His Father had given Him the promise of immortality, or life within Himself. (John 5:26) The </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">man </span><span class="font10">Jesus must remain dead for ever if He is to be a substitute for Adam. By that is meant that He could not be raised up out of death as a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">man </span><span class="font10">and still provide the redemptive price for fallen man. In harmony with TIis promise, God raised up Jesus Christ out of death to life immortal, a divine being. Note the apostle’s argument in this connection. Before He became a man He was a spirit being in the form of God. Unlike Lucifer, He did not seek to grasp that which justly belonged to God, but divested Himself of the spirit nature and became a man; and being a man, He humbled Himself willingly unto death and then God raised Him up to immortality. “Who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and being made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—Phil. 2:6-11, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He was put to death as a man but made alive as a spirit being and exalted to the position of glory and immortality with His Father. (Rev. 3:21; 1 Pet. 3:18) After His resurrection Jesus declared: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Rev. 1:18) God therefore gave unto His beloved Son immortality even as He had promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After God had raised up Jesus out of death and before His ascension into heaven, He said to Mary: “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and vour God.”—John 20:17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the clergymen attempt to say that Jesus was God incarnate, very man and very God, they forget that at the time Jesus gave utterance to the words above quoted He had been raised from the dead a spirit being. He was not then a man. Was He God Himself? The clergy say, Yes. But Jesus said, ‘No, Jehovah God is my Father. I have not. yet ascended to Him but I will ascend to Him.’ Jesus told the truth. The Trinitarians and their father do not tell the truth. Satan the Devil is by Jesus declared to be the father of lies; and He furthermore said that they that follow his course are his children. Let the people take heed to the words of truth as uttered by Jesus, His apostles, and by the prophets, and reject the words of the clergy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>Sin-Offering ,</span></h3>

<p><span class="font10">EEP in mind that it was because of sin that Adam was sentenced to death. Sin is the transgression of God’s law. Justice required the entering of the judgment of death against Adam, and the execution thereof. That judgment was entered by Jehovah in heaven itself. The giving up of the life of the perfect man Jesus corresponded exactly with the perfect life of Adam which had been forfeited by reason of the judgment;,but the death of the perfect man Jesus could in itself work no good to Adam and his race unless the value of that perfect human life of Jesus was presented before divine justice as an offering for sin and as a substitute for the life of Adam and his race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God could have appointed some one else to present the value of that perfect life as a sin-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">offering. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">num</span><span class="font10"> Jesus could not do it. The life was laid down on earth. The value of it must be presented in heaven. It must there be presented by some one who had access to heaven. It pleased God to give to His Son the honor of thus presenting the value of that perfect human life as a sin-offering. Carrying out His purpose, God raised up Jesus out of death to the divine nature, and the divine Jesus now has access to the courts of heaven. When Jesus ascended into heaven He appeared in the presence of Jehovah God and presented the value of His human life as a sin-offering; and it was received in behalf of man as a substitute for the life of Adam, but applied at that time only for those who should be brought to God by faith during the time of sacrifice, and later to be applied for the benefit of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sin-offering had been foreshadowed by the ceremonies which God caused the Jew's to perform. annually. in connection with their atonement day as required by the law. The animals were'slain in the court of the tabernacle and the blood thereof was taken by the high priest into the Most Holy and sprinkled upon the mercy seat. The court of the tabernacle pictured the earth, where the sacrifice of Jesus was made. The Must Holy pictured heaven itself, where the value of that perfect human life was presented as a sin-offering. Concerning this matter it is written: &quot;‘'And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and -without shedding of blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enteretli into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.”—II cb. 9: 22-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Application of the value of the merit of that -sacrifice, the value of the perfect life, was made at that time for the benefit of those who become Christ. Jesus’ footstep followers. That merit will be made available at the inauguration of the new covenant for the reconciliation of all men unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God had foretold by His prophet what should be done concerning the sacrifice of His beloved Son. The prophet wrote: &quot;&quot;Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, ... he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied;... for he shall bear their iniquities . . . because he hath poured out his soul unto death: . . . and he bare the sin of many?’—Isa. 53:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus died for man’s sins as God had foretold and was raised out of death for the justification of man.—1 Cor. 15: 3; Bom. 4: 25.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">AT AN has used the clergy to confuse the people concerning the value of the shed blood of Jesus Christ. One company of them say that &quot;all that is necessary is for man to express himself as out of harmony with sin and ask forgiveness, become a member of some church system, and claim to be Christian and continue as such’. Another company of them say: &quot;The value of Jesus’ blood is as nothing. Jesus was a good man and it is well to keep His example before us as a good pattern to follow. Man, however, must continue to develop character until lie gradually grows into perfection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is better to take the inspired record as it is written by God’s witnesses. Therein it is written : &quot;&quot;Without shedding of blood there is no remission.” (Heb. 9:22) The shedding of the blood of a perfect human being was the only possible way whereby God could be just and the justifier of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The life is in the blood. (Lev. 17:11, 14) The judgment of God required the life-blood of Adam because of sin. As a substitute for the forfeited life of Adam justice accepts the lifeblood of the perfect man Jesus, to the end that in due time the value of that sacrifice may be made available for. the benefit of all men. All mankind, including Adam, shall be redeemed or purchased from death and the grave, even as God promised. (1 Cor.l5:22) During the age of sacrifice, that is to say, during the period of time when God is selecting the members of the body of Christ, the value of that perfect life poured out is applied as a purchase price for the benefit of those who fully consecrate</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'themselves to 'do Go'd’s •will. Later, at the inauguration of the new covenant, the value of that perfect human life shall be made available and applicable as a purchase price for the benefit of all mankind. As a proof that the blood of <sup>J</sup> Jesus is a price of great value paid that man might live, the testimony is written: “Ye are bought with a price.” (1 Cor. 6:20; 7:23) What is that price? The answer is: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">“Xq</span><span class="font10"> were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and without spot.’’—1 Pet. 1:18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To be brought into harmony with God man must know something of God's provision. He must repent of his wrongful course. He must believe that the blood of Jesus was shed as a purchase price for sin, and then God’s mercy must be extended to him. The basis of reconciliation is the life-blood of the perfect man Jesus Christ. In due time all men must be brought to a knowledge of this truth and have an opportunity to be reconciled to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again the enemy has misrepresented Jehovah by claiming’ that God is so cruel that He must have the blood of some one and that His wrath is appeased by the blood of Jesus, and therefore God, being thus appeased, is willing to forgive the sinner. That is entirely untrue. God is just, and the execution of His law in harmony with justice can not be ignored. The love of God provided a way for the requirements of justice to be completely met and this was done by the willing obedience of Jesus unto death. The pouring out of His life-blood as a substitute for Adam forms the basis of reconciliation of man to God; and then, because of man’s repentance, because of his faith in God and faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus and his obedience unto God, he is justified. God is therefore just and the justifier of them that believe.—Born. 3: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconciliation the Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">01) has a well-defined purpose in everything He does. What then &quot;was the purpose of</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19281031_files/g_E_19281031-8.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Jesus’ being made a man, and of His dying as a man; and being raised from death as a divine creature, and ascending into heaven with the value of His perfect human life, and presenting it as a sin-offering? The purpose was that the way might be., made and opened for man to be reconciled unto God. By His arrangement cr plan God included or embraced all mankind in the sin of Adam, in order that when the basis for reconciliation was made by the blood of Jesus all who would believe and be obedient might have the benefit thereof.—Gal. 3:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah did not become a man and die, as the clergy would have you understand, but His Son became a man and died and was raised out of* death that Adam and his offspring might be reconciled unto God. Adam and his children were and are flesh and blood. They have partaken of the human nature. Jesus must do tire same thing in order to redeem mankind. Concerning this it is written: “As the children [of men] are partakers of flesh and blood, he [Jesus] also himself likewise took part [partook] of the same [flesh and blood]. . .. In all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren. that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in. things pertaining to God [His Father], to make reconciliation fdr the sins of the people.”—Heb. 2:14, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All children of men have been sinners, and were born such, and therefore enemies of God, and the shed blood of Jesus opens the way for all men to be reconciled and made the friends of God. When fully reconciled by God, then the children of men shall live. “’.For if, when we were enemi.es, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.”—Roni. 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Beginning at Pentecost God through. Christ opened the way for the exercise of faith in the shed blood of Jesus, and those who have since made a full consecration to do Ged’s will, based upon the faith in Jesus’ blood, God has reconciled to Himself. Paul, and others of his time, and men of like faith since, have availed themselves of the blessed privilege. Therefore Paul wrote: “All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespass-. es unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. . . . For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Cor. 5:18-21) The gracious provision that God has thus made has not been for a selfish purpose. He made this provision unselfishly .for the benefit of man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font10">ATAN has used some of his? agents, the clergy, to exalt the name of Jesus above that of Jehovah. Ue has used others of the same agents to make Jesus and Jehovah equal, and still others to deny the blood of Jesus altogether. His policy is and has been anything to turn the minds and hearts of men away from (tod, to becloud the truth, and to bring reproach upon Jehovah's name. It is not a new trick of his. The Devil pursued the same tactics before the coming of Jesus to earth. He has been teaching the doctrine of a trinity for a long while. In the minds of men lie exalted the wicked Nimrod and the wicked woman Semiramis, his mother, and placed them on an equality with God, thereby introducing a trinity. Then when Christianity began to grow and men were turning to Christ, Satan by his wily methods introduced a. trinity into the ranks of the Christians and fastened that ungodly doctrine upon the church by the Council of Nicea. To do so it was necessary to deny and set aside the plain statements of the Scriptures, to wit: “For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many and lords many,) but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.” (1 Cor. 8:5, 6) In the face of this plain statement of the Lord’s Word, and many other scriptures corroborating the same, the clergy have gone on and still go on teaching the people the Satanic doctrine of the trinity and of the incarnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah God is the Savior of man because he is the Author of His plan of salvation and all things are from Him. Jesus Christ is the Savior of man because He is the active agent of God used by the Father to save men, and all things are done by Him in the Father’s name and by the Father’s authority. Jesus and God are not one and the same in personality, but Jehovah is the Father and Christ Jesus is the Son. All things are from the Father; all things are by the Son.— Eph. 4: 6, 7; 2 Cor. 1:3; Col. 1: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is written: “Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people.” (Ps. 3: 8) The Scriptures frequently speak of Jesus Christ as the Savior because lie is the arm or instrument used to bring salvation to the people. (Isa. 12:2; 59:16; 63:5) The Apostle Paul makes plain and clear the relationship of God the Father with Je.«us Christ His Son, and proves that salvation is from God and that reconciliation of man to God is by and through the blood of His Son. To this end he wrote.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through, his blood, even the forgiveness of sins; who is the image of the ‘ invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, -whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.”—Col. 1:12-21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">GIFT is a benefit bestowed by the giver upon another who is the receiver, bestowed without expectation of return or compensation. Jehovah God is the Giver of every good and perfect gift, “'Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”-—Jas. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the poor that need, gifts. It is the poor in spirit and meek in. heart and lowly of mind that gladly receive and appreciate gifts. The greater the poverty, the greater the need. Because of sin the human race was plunged into the greatest depths of poverty with no right or hope of ever enjoying the riches of life. “The destruction of the poor is their poverty.” (Prov. 10:15) The poverty of the human race leads to certain destruction. Divine love made provision . to prevent such destruction. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus the beloved Son of God enjoyed all the riches of life in glory -with His Father in heaven. He looked down upon the poverty of homankihd, well knowing that the wieked re-belKon of Lucifer had brought such poverty on man. He knew of God’s loving heart and of His purpose to reconcile man to Himself. Jesus was willing to become poor that mankind might be made rich in life and happiness and brought into full reconciliation with God. “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he. became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”— 2 Cor. 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Adam had been made a little lower than the angels of heaven. His sin had reduced him and all his offspring to abject poverty. Jesus left His heavenly glory and was made a man that He, according to the will of His Father, might become the Redeemer of poverty-stricken and sinful men. He was made perfect as a man and clothed with all honor and glory of a perfect man. The earth and all its dominion might have been enjoyed by Him. He willingly gave up everything for the benefit of mam “But we see ’ Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”—Heb. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The death of Jesus upon the cross was for the benefit of all men; and God in His due time will bring all men to an accurate knowledge of the truth, that they may have the opportunity to benefit by His death; It was the will of God that His beloved Son should become a man that He might become the Redeemer of mankind. Jesus was willing to take this step. His Father did not compel Him or even require Him thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostle sets forth in dearness of phrase the distinction between God the Father and Jesus the Son and what the relationship to each other is in providing the ransom sacrifice. He says: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in 'due time.”—1 Tim. 2:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The love of God for His beloved Son Jesus could not be excelled. Jesus testifies to the sweet relationship between Himself and His Father. When He chme to earth and presented Himself at the Jordan, Jehovah announced that others might know: “'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am. well pleased.” The Father and the Son loved each other. (John 3:35; 5:20) The Son was the dearest treasure of His Father’s heart. But without the exercise of love for mankind, man could never be reconciled to God and live. The great God of the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth, freely gave His beloved Son that man might live. The apostle, after having tasted of that love divine and the heavenly gift, with no way of compensating therefor and with no way of adequately expressing appreciation thereof, exclaimed: “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.” (2 Cor. 9:15) Thus the apostle shows that there are no words adequate to express the greatness of God’s gift in behalf of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then again Paul wrote that it was by the offense of Adam all men were born in sin and therefore brought unto condemnation: even so by the righteousness of Christ Jesus the free gift comes unto all men giving all an opportunity for justification unto life. (Rom. 5:18) This great gift proceeds from God the Father, the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Rom. 6:23) Love made this provision. “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) That is a complete expression of unselfishness. It is love divine. “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10) Such is the divine provision for the remission of sin and for the reconciliation of man to God. “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.”—1 John 4:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font10">ICODEMUS was a Pharisee, a rich man, and 'a ruler of the Jews. One evening he came to Jesus and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these, miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then Jesus entered into a conversation with Nicodemus and told him many interesting and important things about the hopes of all mankind and the provision Jehovah God has made for every one to have a full and free opportunity to live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the things that Jesus told Nicodemus is a statement that contains in itself the reason why all those who love the Lord and believe in Him are happy and peaceful even in the midst of trials and troubles. This comforting statement that Jesus made runs thus: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;'For god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of us may wonder not only why people were dying before the Lord made that statement to Nicodemus, but why ever since then they continue to die. That is because we have not read the Bible account carefully enough to get its real meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you notice that the Lord said that ‘&quot;whosoever believeth in him should not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perish,</span><span class="font10"> but have everlasting life'&quot;? There is the part that is so often misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The word, &quot;'perish” means to die for ever; to die with no hope of living again; to be absolutely and permanently blotted out; to be made nil; to go out of the memory'of God and man for ever; that when we came to die we would go out like a candle-flame, and never, never, never come to life again. That would be a terrible thing for us to look forward to, wouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We all know that, with the exception of Jesus, every person who has lived upon this earth has inherited death because of the sentence of death which God passed upon Adam after he had disobeyed the heavenly command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah God Himself tells us, in the Bible, His Holy Word, that “the dead know not anything”. If it were not for the great love the heavenly Father has for His creatures, people would continue to die and go into that state of knowing nothing at all, of seeing, feeling, hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ing, smelling, tasting nothing, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font10"> nothing at all, for ever and ever. In ether words, they would </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perish.</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;tv!&quot;<sup>1115</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But &quot;God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">net</span><span class="font10"> perish,, but have everlasting life”. <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore, since Jesus spoke those wonderful words to Nicodemus the Pharisee, all those who love the Lord and believe in Him know, by the promise of the great Almighty God Himself, that they will not die for ever, but will be raised from the dead in the great times of resurrection now dawning and be given a full and fair chance to continue living upon this beautiful earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This promise of which Jesus spoke includes all the many millions of people who have died since the days of Adam, and who are yet in their graves, knowing, feeling, hearing, seeing nothing, being nothing, until the hand of Jehovah God shall call them forth and give them life; and more than that, give them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">everlasting </span><span class="font10">life if they keep His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the resurrection-time so close at hand, as the Bible prophecy clearly shows, the Lord’s people have reason to believe that many millions of persons now living will not have to die at all, because the time is so very near when the dead will begin to return; and of course when that occurs, those already living will not need to die, as the curse of death upon the whole human family will be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is another instance of the loving-kindness of Jehovah God that He caused this conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus to be written into His Word. Probably Nicodemus did not understand at the time what Jesus meant, or to what time in the future the Lord was referring; but God knew that there would come times many hundreds of years later, when some! of His people would be sore pressed by trials of one kind or another and could turn for relief to the pages of His Word, the Bible, where they would find new strength and hope and joy for themselves and be able to share with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After this conversation with the ruler of the Jews, Nicodemus, Jesus and His disciples went! into the land of Judea. John the Baptist also was there, baptizing with w'ater all those who came and believed in the name of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The Default of the Radio Commission</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font10">UNE 15, 1927, in an address to the Federal Radio Commission at Washington, Judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rutherford said to them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“When WBBR began to operate we were tenth in the list of those licensed [in the New York metropolitan area]. Today, after being on the air for three and one-half years, we are twenty-fifth in the list of those allocated wave lengths of advantage. I want to call attention here to this, which is of far more public interest than merely one ease that is being heard by the Commission.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“For some time there has been a concentration of money power in this land to control every business and every public interest. The predatory wealth controls the banks, the public press and the transportation systems; and now it is reaching its octopus arms out to control the air. It says to the people in effect: ‘Wo will take the air and do with it what we please. We will make all the money out of it we can, and then give you what &quot;we do not want.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On September 10, 1928, the above warning that the radio is scheduled by Big Business to come 'wholly under its control, was verified. On that date the Radio Commission (which has been in existence only since March, 1927) made a reallocation in which all the choice wave lengths were assigned to Big Business and all attempts to educate the people were relegated to the graveyard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From November 11, 1928, WBBR, now operating on 256.3 wave length and 1000 watts power, is designated to operate on 230.6 wave length and reduced to 500 watts power, although twenty-five miles from any congested district; while WORD, now<sup>7</sup> operating on 252.0 wave length is designated to operate on 202.6, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">and it is forty miles out in the country from Chicago.</span><span class="font10"> The Radio Commission has defaulted in the great trust imposed upon it by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Having an intimation that this reallocation was going to go in the direction which it finally did, Judge Rutherford on September 6 addressed a letter to the Radio Commission, a copy of which has now been handed to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The letter and the action of the Commission shows a determined effort on the part of Big Business not only to control the commerce of the country and the politics of the country, but now it seems they are about to try to force the people to accept their “religion”. This is an insult to Jehovah God, and in His own due time He will surely take appropriate action. The Judge’s letter follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sept. 6, 1928 To the Federal Radio Commission,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Department of Interior Building, Washington, D. C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gentlemen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is hardly to be expected that this letter will accomplish any immediate good, but it will be on record to bear witness in the future. Since my interview with various members of your Commission on Tuesday last, I feel it my duty to write you. In the outset please be assured of my kind feeling toward you personally. Knowing me, I believe that you will bear witness that I am not erratic nor an extremist. I repeat my words uttered before your Commission on a former occasion: “What I say here is not a threat, but a warning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From my personal knowledge of you gentlemen I believe that each of you desires to do what is right, but I am wholly convinced that you are unable to do so because of yielding to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">influences, some of which are visible and some invisible. It is well known that the great visible controlling factor of America is Big Business, and that Professional Politicians and an Apostate Clergy work in conjunction with that selfish interest. All of these yield unconsciously to an unseen and powerful influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I understand that it is now the purpose of the Federal Radio Commission to clear the choice radio frequency channels and assign them to the big commercial stations, which are properly designated the “Trust Stations”, while other stations are to be crowded into the less favorable and already congested broadcasting channels. That means that Big Business will exercise a monoply of the air and the people will be at their mercy. The “Trust Stations” are permitted to operate on super-power and to literally control the air. The people will be compelled to listen to what the “Trust Stations” give them or not listen at all. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is well known that Mr. Aylesworth, president of the National Broadcasting Co., is spokesman for the Radio Trust in America. In the opinion of many this is but a factor of the Power Trust. The public press recently quoted Mr.. Aylesworth as saying: “As part of the University of the Air project it is planned to institute a series of programs entitled ‘Great Messages of Religion’, in which the clergy of the Jewish, Protestant and Roman faiths will be invited to participate. Much as I would like to shun the mantle of prophet, I can not refrain from expressing the belief that the day is near when we shall have what I am pleased to term a ‘radio clergyman’. His creed is of no import; but his views shall he of the broad view’s of tolerance, and he shall represent the best of religious thought which the experience of twenty centuries has to offer. This ‘radio clergyman’ will devote his entire time and efforts to ministering to the spiritual needs of the vast radio family, and his shall be the greatest congregation the world has ever known. There is but one thing that we demand of the religious message that goes on the air, and that is that it be non-denominational andnon-seetarianin appeal. Be our broadcaster rabbi, priest or mini ster, we ask him only that he interpret the religious experience in broadest terms so that the individual listener, whoever he may be, may be brought to a fuller and. .finer realization, of his duty to his. own church and to his fellow men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be it noted that according to the scheme outlined by the Radio Trust, Jehovah God is not taken into consideration. God’s will and His Word of Truth are to be pushed completely aside and a great “Message of Religion” is to be dished out that is pleasing to the Trust regardless of the interests of the people. That scheme is most intolerant because it would preclude anything being broadcast that does not meet the requirements of the Trust. Tolerance means that there shall be a full and fair opportunity for the discussion of all questions of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is well known that Big Business controls the commerce of America and the politics of the nation, and now it is boldly and blatantly announced that it will control the religious things that the people shall hear. Clergymen unfaithful to God and their vows yield and are yielding to the sinister influence of the Trust. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Permit me to suggest that there are millions of people in America that are not at all in sympathy with the program of the clergymen and Big Business. These good, honest millions believe in the Bible as taught by Jesus Christ and the apostles, and by the good Christian ministers who during the early days of America taught the truth of the Bible then due to be understood and that without monetary consideration. This opinion is fully supported by the great flood of letters and telegrams which I have received from the people throughout America during the past few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Federal Radio Law was enacted and you gentlemen were appointed to see that the people get what is of interest, necessity and convenience for them. The “Radio Trust” does not meet any of these requirements so far as the serious-minded people of the land are concerned. The Power Trust fleeces the people, the politicians direct the affairs of the government according to the wishes of Big Business, and the unfaithful clergy give the people a senseless harangue that is approved by the Trust. None of these things are of interest, convenience or necessity for the people. There is nothing in their programs that is uplifting and ennobling to the people, or that will cause them to know and to reverence the great Creator of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Applications of Stations WBBR and WORD filed with your Commission for an increase of power and for assignment, to more favorable broadcasting channels, that the plain teaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of the Bible may be broadcast that will comfort, upbuild and aid the people and be an honor to the Name of Jehovah God, have been ignored. Stations built for this lawful purpose, although early in the field and broadcasting programs of interest, convenience and necessity to the general good and welfare of the American people, have been relegated to the unfavorable channels in order to make way for the Trust. The “Radio Trust” is not interested in the people’s welfare, but its chief objective is to increase its power in money and influence over the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is of far greater importance to the people that they learn of Jehovah God and His plan for their salvation and blessing, than to listen to the speeches of clergymen that have been approved by the Power Trust. The mere fact of approval by the Power Trust is complete proof that such so-called “Great Messages of Religion” are not beneficial to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is of far greater convenience and benefit to the people that they hear sacred songs that honor and praise the Name of Jehovah God than to be compelled to listen to jazz and dance music. It is of far greater importance to the nation that the Name of Jehovah God be honored than to aid the “Radio Trust” to forward its selfish interests. It is written in the Bible, and that for the guidance of men, “Blessed is the nation whose God is.Jehovah.” The converse of that statement must be true. What, then, is to be expected of a nation that makes Big Business its god and permits predatory interests to flourish at the expense of the general welfare of the people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The radio belongs to Jehovah God. It is not man’s invention. Certainly Big Business does not rightfully own and control it. Why,then, do men yield to this selfish influence of the Trust? I answer, There is an unseen and more powerful influence that controls all selfish interests and therefore controls the world. That invisible power and influence is Satan the Devil, whom the Bible designates as “the prince of the power of the air”, and again, “the prince of this world,” and again, “the god of this world.” The “Radio Trust” would never permit the clergymen to broadcast these Bible truths concerning the Devil and his power over the nations. How, then, are the people to learn of their unseen and sinister enemy and to learn who is their real friend, if the “Radio Trust” has its way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I shall not burden you by here dwelling upon my reasons for this statement. While in your offices on Tuesday last, I noticed on your book shelves a copy of my recent book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Government. </span><span class="font10">If you can find the time to read that book you will ascertain my reasons for the above statement concerning the invisible power and also why the people are now denied their just rights, and what is to be the relief for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No longer can 'America boast of being the land of religious freedom as the Constitution guarantees. The fact that Big Business now controls the air and causes clergymen in the Name of the Lord to hypocritically serve up a “Great Message of Religion” that has the approval of the Power Trust and which ignores the Word of God, is but another proof that freedom of thought is done. It is also evidence that the end is near. No nation can continue to ignore God and continue to exist. The selfish predatory powers have the people by the throat and oppress them without mercy. Unfaithful to God, the clergy yield to that unrighteous influence, aiding in the oppression of the people and in keeping them in ignorance of God’s provision for their -welfare. God has promised to hear the cries of the people in due time. Their cries have reached unto His ears. The end of oppression is near at hand. It will be the most terrible day of reckoning that the world has ever known. God declares He will justly and fully recompense the oppressors by completely breaking them to pieces. It is my privilege to call your attention to these facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your Commission can not entirely relieve the people now, but you can lend some aid to them by enabling them to hear what is for their good and comfort in a time of stress. To those who thus aid the poor and the oppressed, God gives a consoling promise; and it is also my privilege to call your attention to that, to wit: “Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.”-— Psalm 41:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You gentlemen occupy a position of great responsibility to man and to God. You have the most golden opportunity to say to the selfish interests that the radio belongs to Jehovah God and that He has brought it into action for the, benefit of mankind, and that the people shall have the use of it to honor the Name of God and to upbuild, aid and comfort themselves. That responsibility you can not escape. Two ways are before you and between these you must choose, to wit: Yield to the powerful and selfish interest of the Trusts, which Trusts are under the influence and control of the enemy Satan, or grant a full and fair opportunity to the people to hear and learn of Jehovah God and His gracious provisions for them and thereby give honor to. His Name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of your members the other day said to me, “You. must pray for us.” I do pray that God will give you the courage to tell the Power Trust to stand aside and let the people have a full and fair opportunity to hear the Word of God freely discussed that they may know the way He has provided for their salvation and happiness. Because of the importance of your position relative to the teaching of the people, there is a far greater responsibility upon the Federal Radio Commission at this time than upon the President of the United States. It is of much more importance that the people know the Truth than that they possess all the money and honor that the world can afford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once more in the Name of Jehovah God, the author and creator of the radio, I ask that you grant unto radio stations WBBR and WORD more favorable broadcasting channels, to the end that the people may have a chance to hear the truth and that without money and without price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Believe me, gentlemen, in all sincerity-Your friend,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J. F. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty in Galax, Virginia</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font10">IX M. D.’s in the city. of Galax, Virginia, -over their own signature, warned a chiro- • praetor to take dovzn his shingle and leave all care of the sick to them. Whereupon he publicly quoted for their consideration the following act of Virginia, later approved by the United States Supreme Court: “To suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all liberty; because he being, of course, judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own. It is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font10">HE Industrial Transference Board of the British Isles has announced that after ten years' study of the problem it sees no way out of it but that Britain must lose a million population; two hundred thousand miners must seek work elsewdiere. Under present conditions this is no doubt true. Canada could take these and would be glad to get them. The problem is how to convince the million that they must move and how to help them in their new homes until they become self-supporting. How much we need the Lord’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A Bishop on Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">rpiIE Bishop of London has just said: “So far as death is concerned, I can only say that .1 regard it as one of the greatest blessings we have. Think of the state of the world today if no one ever died. It would be absolutely intolerable.” All this from the bishop in violation of the Scriptures, which call death a curse and an enemy and declare that this great enemy of mankind is to be destroyed. If the bishop were in the middle of a ten-acre lot with a red handkerchief sticking out of his pocket, and a mad bull were to take after him, we w-onder if he would run, or if he would just piously fold his hands and say: “I regard this as one of the greatest blessings I have ever had.”</span></p>

He seemed to be greatly interested, for he jumped through no less than four plate glass windows, partly wrecking- a drug store, a department store and an automobile sales room. In the last place he visited he upset a show case, and it got his nerves so on edge that he had to postpone the remainder of his shopping; tour to another time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">AT THE Congregational Conference held at Oxford, England, .Reverend John Bevan, . ignoring the reverence of our Savior and of the apostles for God’s Holy Word, ridiculed the Old Testament, declared it obsolete, stated that it should be kept out of the hands of the immature, urged that congregations should be told that it has no bearing- on revealed truth and that it could be dispensed -with. Is it any wonder the churches are empty? Why go to hear blatant infidels?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Methodist pastor, New York city, is reported as saying: “It is confusing today to know from wdiat source to expect the voice of God.” Sorry the Reverend is confused, but there is no excuse for it. The apostle tells us plainly that the Word of God liveth and abid-eth for ever, that it is able to make us wise unto salvation, and that it is sufficient that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good -work. What does the Reverend Kincheloe want any better than that?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark19"></a>“Thinking with Africa”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font10">NE of our valuer! subscribers, an educated Cuban living in Pittsburgh, has sent us a copy of this little 184-page book, which contains an appeal for a more intelligent treatment of the African in his homeland on the part of missionaries from other lands. It is put out by the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 5 tells us: “Tn cases tried in native courts there is more justice and less law than in European courts.” Something here to think about, and not greatly to the credit of the bar of Europe or America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 13 tells us that “in uncontaminated African society, as it exists in some parts of the continent today, a most beautiful and complete altruism is practised. No orphanages or almshouses are needed, and best of all, perhaps, there are no old maids. Children are an asset and not a liability, and there would he competition among kinsmen for a deceased relative’s children did not their social organization, indicate clearly who was to be the guardian of the orphans. Similarly the care of one’s own old folks, of the aged generally, and of the halfwitted, is laid down clearly by traditional laws”. Might not be a bad idea to send some of our lawmakers over to the jungles to find out what those laws are. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 47 says that “the .story of land in South Africa is neither a short one nor a pleasant one, and we must here be content with a plain tale. The Bantu are a land-hungry people”. We get some idea of why they are land-hungry when we read in the adjoining paragraph: “There are approximately four and one-half million Bantu distributed over the Union of South Africa today. Seven out of every eight still live in rural areas. Europeans own four-fifths of the land. Almost half of these four and a half million Bantu are to be found on farms which are mostly European-owned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That the Bantus could understand the principles of true Christianity without great difficulty seems conveyed by the statement on page 52: “The Bantu people are being Christianized, although not as swiftly as many would wish. About one-third of the people are professing Christians, and these form the progressive element in the population. As mentioned earlier, the Bantu quickly assimilated the doctrines of the Christian religion and are appreciative of Christian ethical values.” We hazard the suggestion that more Bantus would be Christians if the whites who are supposed to be Christians had taken a triflle less than four-fifths of everything in sight in the short time they have been in their midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How the Christians have treated their black brothers, doing unto them as they would not allow anybody to do to them in return, seems clear as we read on page 55: “So long as he was content to be a mine-boy, pastor, teacher in the schools, kitchen-boy, and even a lawyer or doctor practising among his own people, the white worker took little notice of him and cared less what he earned, being himself content to &quot;ride on the back’ of the Bantu unskilled worker by drawing at least ten times the burden-bearers’ low wages.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Justice of the Dutch variety is set forth on page 56: “At the same time the government has been displacing non-European labor on the state railways and in other state departments on the specious plea that only &quot;'civilized’ labor should be employed. In every case the term ‘civilized’ has been interpreted as synonymous with white or colored, i.e., mulatto,, labor: for because of their number, their voting strength, their habits of life and their Dutch nationality, the present government has driven a wedge between black and colored and awarded the mulatto section the dignity of being civilized for political and industrial purposes.” It was not a mulatto that Philip was sent to baptize. It was a black man. God considered him just as fit a receptacle for His own holy spirit as any •white man, no matter how ‘civilized’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From a statement on page 63 we seem to get the thought that the black men of South Africa would like to have the Christians treat them like human beings: “What native Africans want is not social mixture with the &quot;whites, but equal opportunities in the fields of industry and commerce. When they see their people economically losing ground and gradually coming to the border-line of starvation, they often lose the power of self-control and use violent language in an endeavor to force the attention of the authorities. In consequence they have been stigmatized as demagogues and agitators.” Ask almost any judge or college president around Boston and he will tell you right away, -with-out hesitation, that any black man that is peeved by starvation, and becomes disturbed and gets excited and wants things evened up a little, most certainly </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font10"> a demagogue and an agitator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We gather from page 69 that the opening up of Africa, while it has brought the natives and others many blessings, has brought them some other things too: “In opening up East. Africa to trade the white men also opened it up to disease. Old diseases once isolated in separate tribes have now clear lines of communication. Thus did sleeping sickness gain access to Uganda, destroying between two and three hundred thousand human beings before it was brought under control. Thus too have those pests, the jiggers, spread across the continent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One gathers from page 71 that the blacks have some preference as to the kind of people they work for: “If a European goes to East Africa uninvited by Africans, gets land, but not from Africans, and engages in coffee planting or maize growing, does this impose upon Africans a moral duty to supply him with the labor he needs ? The white man thinks it does. One of the most disturbing elements of life in East Africa as reflected in the local press is the marked exasperation of those who want African laborers and can not get them. The wages paid to laborers in Africa are altogether out of keeping with those paid in civilized countries. This is partly accounted for by the fact that the quality of the labor is below Western standards. When, however, allowance has been made for this, it still remains a fact that labor in East Africa is underpaid. Throughout large areas two and a half to three shillings a week (63e to 75c), plus food, constitutes the average wage of the manual worker. Employers say they can not pay more. It would seem that some one is exploiting native labor, and that the responsibility for this must lie somewhere between the consumer overseas and the employer in East Africa.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 73 contains a hint that the blacks do not get just a square deal in. the matter of taxes: “Quite apart from questions of oppression in the methods of collection, there is the much graver question of whether or not the African receives adequate returns for the taxes he pays. In Uganda it is alleged that cotton-growing areas are developed partly by proceeds from taxable areas where cotton is not grown. In Kenya it is said by many that native Reserves have been neglected in order that European areas might have more money spent on improving them.” One can but vzonder if anything like this goes on in other parts of the world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oddly the same page seems to convey the thought that the blacks do not appreciate the loss of their liberties: “Thirty years ago all the tribes throughout Kenya and Uganda were free people, under subjection to no foreigner, though some of them were often raided by their more powerful neighbors. Within the lifetime of many, these people have passed from the position of a free race to that of a subject race. And they do not like it.” How odd!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The blessings of sectarian evangelism are shown on page 75: “Some religious leaders unhesitatingly endeavor to isolate their converts from activities in which Africans of another sect take part. Such religious bigotry cuts clean across many cooperative movements for the common good. The policy whereby each mission stakes out an area for its evangelistic activities, resulting in. what are often called spheres of ecclesiastical influence, is fraught with ill as well as good. Like their forerunners in the political world, these spheres were assigned to the various denominations without any consultations with Africans. They constitute barriers to religious Africans of one denomination in seeking to evangelize those of their own tribe over the border. There arc many Africans 'whose spirit is in rebellion against these spheres of influence. They are challenging the moral right of missionaries to parcel out among themselves a country not their own, when such action automatically restricts the religious freedom of the natives in both thought and activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How the World 'War changed things in Africa is shown' on page 79: “The Baganda are the most progressive of our East Africans, and have now four papers of their own. In these one finds a freedom of expression almost as great as exists in England. Meanwhile migrations of laborers contribute greatly to the dissemination of news and ideas. Thousands of men were conscripted during the late war. Those who survived came back to their tribes with a mental horizon incomparably wider than those who remained- at home.” The Africans are thinking and talking, the two things most dreaded by tyranny and hypocrisy. “The extraordinary thing about native life today is the number of meetings that are being held all over the country. The emerging leader is a great walker, or, it may be, a cyclist: he meets a group of from half a dozen to a hundred followers here today, and tomorrow, ten, twenty or even fifty miles away he meets another group.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pitiable state of sanitary conditions among the lowly Africans is shown on page 83: “It is part of the British policy to reduce as rapidly as possible the high infant mortality, which ranges, as far as can be ascertained in the absence of vital statistics, between 450 and 650 per 1,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How even the natives untouched by civilization have been making their livelihood is shown on page 86: “In spite of the fact that Africa as a continent abounds with great game, few African people are pure hunters and almost all Bantu populations practise either hoe culture or a pastoral life or the two combined. Over a large part of the Congo area cattle and sheep can not be raised, and it is here that we find people practising pure hoe culture with a background of hunting, and raising a few domestic animals such as pigs, fowls and goats.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Family life, in spite of the widespread polygamy, is of a definite sort: “Among all these people each married woman has her own home, and with her husband, who is the connecting link with other such houses, and her children forms an independent economic community. Each such little group feeds itself, clothes itself, houses itself, and makes all such implements and utensils as it may require.” Page 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The amenability of the African to instruction in the truth is suggested on page 107: “To help the African peoples to reverence God is not difficult; to introduce a worship of God is easy, for they already have, as I have stated, a belief in a supreme power, which so far has had little contact with the daily run of men’s lives but which nevertheless is fully real to them. To teach them to reverence a Christian God and to live a Christian life will be neither more nor less difficult than it is to teach the rest of humanity, once the great stumbling-block (devil-worship) is removed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The missionaries are accused of destroying much that was good in the abolishing of the ceremonies which formerly took place when children reached the age of puberty. Page 116 tells us: ‘’Nothing has been supplied of a Christian character to replace these age-long opportunities of youth to receive authoritative precepts on the code of adult conduct in a manner compatible with national tradition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The simple-minded natives have been unable to understand sectarian splits. “This has made it harder to make converts, because when the Africans are visited by rival mission bands they inevitably ask, ‘How many gods are there? Which god are we asked to believe?’ ” Page 11,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the same page we get the native retorts as to the practical results which have come to them.: “They told you to close your eyes and pray, and the other whites came and took away the land from behind your back while you kept your eyes closed.” Another favorite saying is: “At first we had the land and the ’white man had the Bible: now we have the Bible and the white man has the land.” A conscientious objector to the Christian religion is reported as also saying: “If I take this religion, you whites will take my name down in your book, and a government magistrate will follow and take my land in your absence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The African heathens are thinking about this war business, which was so dear to all so-called Christians so recently as ten years ago: “The attitude of Christian missions toward war has always struck the African thinker as one of enigmatic inconsistency. While the New Testament exhorts, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers,’ the missionaries pray to the God of peace for victory in war.” Page 118. Apparently this war game is near its finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The inconsistency of the white man is shown up on page 121: “It is impossible to disagree with them on the failure of Western organizations to live up to the ideals of Christianity. They attack the snobbery of some modern missionaries. They unfavorably contrast the apparently luxurious life of some white missionaries who travel about in automobiles, with the humbleness of the earliest missionaries who lived the lowly life of Africans. They affirm that Christianity outside missionary circles fails to mollify the essential cruelty, coarseness and selfishness of the ordinary white man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One slip that the missionaries made is mentioned on page 122: “They did not start from the known and proceed to the unknown. They went hurry-skurry in condemning all that was</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bantu. In fact, some 'did not preach Christianity as such, but rather the destruction of Bantu customs, and used Christianity as an effective means toward that end, threatening people with hell-fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How the natives regard the supposed superiority of the whites is shown on the next page: “Now that the natives, upon awakening from their sleep of ignorance, find they have been made to lose their initiative, to lose their inventive powers, which were starved to death by men who today scornfully censure them as of ‘non-inventive powers’, though they know truly that they found the Bantu with their inventions : now that the Bantu have to buy these utensils dearly from a European store; now that they see clearly how their land, with its ancient iron and tin mines, has been cuifningly taken from them in order to render them uninventive and to enrich the white man by making him the sole possessor of all the material resources and necessities of this life and of the best arable land: I say, when the natives observe all this they feel dizzy and find themselves resenting everything that is European and Western. So, without fairly testing Christianity and comparing it with their own religion in essence, they condemn it chiefly because it was introduced by Europeans, in whom they are fast losing confidence, if confidence is not already irrevocably lost. They blame the missionary most because he is the nearest white man whose mode of living they can study and be brought into direct contact with. They hear him preaching Christ Jesus, but do not see him or his state acting like Christ Jesus. They say that the state is Christian: it has sent this man to blindfold and hoodwink us with this mild religion to the advantage of the state. The missionary and the politician are brothers working in collusion for the same end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long-faced religion does not appeal to the blacks, so says page 129: “Take the abolition of amusements and musical dances with nothing else put in their place. The non-eonvert natives taunt the Christians with being a lugubrious, long-faced and unamused community devoid of the fun-making entertainments of the good old times. This lack of gayety in native Christian communities has led to the other extreme and unconsciously abetted the evils of gambling, drunkenness and immorality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The South African legislature has been making all kinds of discriminatory and oppressive restrictions against the blacks, but there is another matter that comes even closer home and so, page 143: “Now the ‘civilized’ labor policy<sup>7</sup> of the present government, which operates to the dismissing of the Africans from all skilled or semi-skilled employment to make room for ‘poor’ whites, still further intensifies the bitterness. The black laborer, who receives wages at the rate of two, three or four pounds sterling a month, sees his white fellow-laborer receiving that amount for a week, or it may be even for a day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pages 147 onward give a comparison of past and present missionaries: “In the early days of mission work in this country, missionaries were devoted men and women whom natives followed blindly, as they considered them to be exemplary in regard to moral character, personal piety, devoutness, inner purity of heart, kindness and benevolence. They were not only respected and adored, but they were looked upon as true messengers of peace and good-will. Conditions are changed with the advent of the modern missionary. He is looked upon, rightly or wrongly, with some amount of suspicion by the natives as another representative of the aggressive system of the West.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 150 tells us that the African is a human being just like the rest of us: “It is true that an African native is a curious compound of suspicion, superstition, childlike simplicity, and mulish obstinacy. If he knows and trusts his leader he may be guided gently toward civilization, may be made a useful member of society and even a Christian: but he will resist with the whole force of his nature any attempt to kick him from behind into comfort or into heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One can see plainly from the foregoing that all Africa needs is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the truth,</span><span class="font10"> and until the missionaries themselves know what that is they had far better let the Africans alone. Thank God that the day is at hand when the truth is surely going to go to Africa and all the world. It is too good to keep. It is what all the world wants, and with the downfall of Satan’s empire, the principles of which are so clearly manifest in the foregoing, there will be nothing to prevent its eventualolessing of every son of Ham.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font10">T IS a well-established fact in science that the atom is the smallest complete particle of matter, and that it in turn, is composed of one or more charges of positive and negative electricity. There are some ninety odd different atoms to be found in all of earth’s matter, each, element having its peculiar kind of atom which differs structurally from its neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The simplest atom known is that of hydrogen. It is composed of one charge of positive and one charge of negative electricity. These swing about each other as dumb-bells. The other atoms resemble minute planetary systems, containing a center or nucleus of electrical charges about which rotate other negative charges called electrons, in similar fashion to that in which the earth and other planets of our solar system swing about the sun,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Although these atoms are infinitely small, they still have a definite size, mass, inertia, and charge. There is vast space between the nucleus of the atom and its planetary electrons traveling in their orbits about this center, just as there are great distances in our solar system between the sun and its planets. All of the known elements have been named and numbered according to the number of planetary electrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These range from hydrogen as No. 1 to uranium as No. 92. Three or four elements in this orderly list are yet to be found. Some of the known elements are: oxygen with eight planets, magnesium with twelve, phosphorus with fifteen, potassium with nineteen, iron with twenty-six, nickel with twenty-eight, copper with twenty-nine, zinc w<sup>T</sup>ith thirty, silver with forty-seven, and lead with eighty-two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In radium and certain other heavy atoms radio activity was discovered. It is that strange phenomenon whereby an atom continues to emit radiant energy, or to shoot off minute charges of electricity. In fact, it is believed that all matter is radio active to a greater or less extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Radiant energy, certain rare minerals, and vitamines generally associated with these minerals have a direct bearing on our health. The mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms are closely linked. Any unusual state in the mineral 'domain will directly affect the vegetable kingdom also. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For example, among thousands of plants there is one that grows only on zinc veins or in zincky belts. This zinc pansy, or “Viola Calimanaria”, is found all over the world, but always only in zinc districts or near zine mines. Naturally it is used as a guide by prospectors. This sweet little flower is supposed to be the parent or grandmother of all the violet and pansy family. It has seven percent of zinc in its ash, whereas the ash of pansy seeds contains one-half of one percent of zinc. This explains why they flourish in certain soils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As another example, we may look at the tobacco plant. It has considerable lithia in its ash. Cuban tobacco has from two to three percent lithia, which is several times as much as the common, plant. These plants come from well-defined areas in which they flourish; whereas land outside of the zone will yield but a small quantity of this harmful weed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Having traced the minerals to the vegetable kingdom, let us now trace them to the animal kingdom also. The South African plantaineater, the touraco, has seven percent of copper in the coloring matter of its feathers. Would it not be reasonable to suppose that this copper was assimilated largely through the kind of vegetation that was consumed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Iodine is an element. Its effects are generally well known. Sea-weed takes out that trace of iodine found in sea-water and concentrates it in itself. The bodies of animals, including man, concentrate it in the thyroid gland from food. A very delicate and sure test of iodine is its property of turning starch blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A deficiency of iodine causes an enlargement of the neck called goiter. The goiter belt of the middle west corresponds well with that region where there is a low iodine content in water and soil. Iodine assists the body to produce thyroxin, which energizes the nerves and brain. It may be safely asserted that a constant tired feeling is due to little iodine, and that laziness is a sign of its deficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The amount of iodine required for the daily need is unbelievably small. The entire human race has only a small carload in its system. The billion and a half consumers use only ten pounds an hour. And yet this small amount keeps us humans from degenerating to something worse than monkeys. The amount of iodine in the average thyroid is only one-sixth of a grain, and this is sufficient for a hundred days of normal human activity. At this rate, one six-hundredth of a grain is used daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Exhausted soldiers of the World War had their supply reduced to one sixty-fifth of a grain, while especially favored persons have as much as half a grain. The average one sixhundredth of a grain used daily by man is all that saves man from being an imbecile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is proven by the existence of a class of bodily deformed and mentally unsound children, called cretins, who are peculiar to mountain regions. They are born with an extremely weak thyroid gland and are well called human plants. They are a pitiful sight, unable to see, think, or act as other humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since this is due to the fact that their thyroid will not work at all, they can, unless otherwise defective, be transformed into fairly nor-jujpl and happy children by feeding them thyroid glands of sheep. Stop the thyroid feeding, and they become human plants again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is another fact about iodine that is significant. It must be fed continuously and eliminated continuously. When it has been used up, it becomes inert or dead and has no .further beneficial effect on the body. Another item of inestimable value is the fact that iodine which has been through a vegetable or animal process, like that in sea-weed or cod-liver oil is some two hundred times as effective as iodine that -is purchased from a drug store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seems certain that iodine, or iodides (for it is always combined with sodium or potas-. sium in the.form of a neutral salt), must possess some peculiar radium-like quality, which it gains under the influence of sunlight, and which it imparts to animal life producing sanity and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Numerous examples of the great influence of a &quot;wee bit of the iodide salts on health might be cited. For instance, the robust qualities of sea-faring men, who live on sea food, and breathe salt-air, are well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a striking example of this on the coast of China. At one place the mountain ranges come very close to the sea. The Chinese in the mountains are short, stocky, and lazy. The Chinese fishermen, only half a dozen miles away, are tall, rangy, energetic and quick; whereas half-way between the two areas there is an intermediate or transition type. Let a mountain family go to the sea, and in a generation they become quick-acting individuals; and, vice versa, &quot;when a family from the sea goes to the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did you ever notice what the Japs in downtown New York restaurants are eating! You will find nearly all of them eating fish. It is iodine and sea food that explains what quick eyes and brains the Japs have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now if iodine plays such an important part in imparting health, would it not seem reasonable that other rare elements would perform similarly necessary functions? Some of these rare elements belong to the most important class of catalyzers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A catalyzer is a chemical go-between, or mediator, that, though not undergoing chemical change, plays the role of producing it. It inspires chemical changes, just as an orator stirs our feelings, and it creates an affinity betwmen chemical elements. Not only does it speed up the chemical processes, but without it these changes would not go on at all. All the processes of life depend on some sort of a living catalyzer, or enzyin, as it is called. Pepsin, trypsin, insulin, and bile, all possess catalytic powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now assuming what has thus far been said as reasonably true, and that certain rare elements in the body are indispensable to sanity and health, and that the absence of such elements marks loss of health, would it not seem reasonable that the presence of wrong elements in the body would be marked by a malignant disease? This is exactly what we shall find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By conducting a series of experiments and by prolonged research work Mr. W. McA. Johnson, of Hartford, Conn., brought some important points to light. Among other diseases, cancer was studied. To the average person this may seem most abhorrent, but to a biochemist it is a most fascinating sight, because it is a complete departure from health; and by studying the abnormal one sees such a caricature of the normal that the important points that govern the life of a normal cell can be readily learned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For instance, how<sup>7</sup> do the good and useful cells of the liver become replaced by the criminal cells of a cancer and finally kill that organization of cells called a body? Cells have, both the “habit of growth” and the “habit of work”. In a child, the former habit is most pronounced; but as the child attains to years this habit decreases until an equilibrium is reached, so that there is only enough growth to replace those cells which are being worn out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These cells perform the required work of the body. Now then, cancer, the disease of diseases, gets a foothold and creates new cells which have not the “habit of work” but have only the “habit of growth”. These wild, selfish cells grow at the expense of other cells and finally cause the death of the human body by disrupting its organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Were these cells identified by the absence of certain rare minerals and the presence of certain wrong ones? Yes. The rare elements in certain parts of the body are caesium (a heavy and rare alkali like potash), lead, tin and zinc. In the cancerous cells there was not a bit of these, but only a very heavy amount of arsenic, with of course the usual lime, magnesia, soda, chlorine, etc. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now as a means of cheeking up the correctness of the former conclusions the thymus gland was studied. These glands in calves keep them from being cows or bulls before their time, and keep children children. When a child or young animal reaches its adult stage, this gland shrinks to one-quarter of its former size, and in a wasting disease it shrinks up altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now if the lead, tin and zinc found in normal healthy cells should not be in this healthy gland, one might conclude their presence was accidental; but if they also should be found in this gland of health and. joy, which ceases to exist in a state of wasting disease, then the conclusion must be that they serve some useful purpose of nature. These elements, as well as other rare elements, were found in the thymus or throat-sweetbread of a calf. One of these elements constituted twenty-five percent of its ash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus the conclusion seems to be reasonably established, that with no rare minerals there is no health, and a condition comparable to that of an inactive tumor; with no rare minerals and some of the wrong ones, there is a positive state of disease; with the proper rare minerals there is health; and with them in abundance, there is excellent health and activity. In general the rare elements are found highest where the tissue has vitaministic, or other health-imparting properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now let ns go a step further in our examination, to the yolk of an egg. The fertilized yolk is the foundation from ■which the organism of the new chick is developed. In that new chick there must be that organization of cells required for its body . to function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If rare minerals serve in the proper functioning and upbuilding of an organism, then we should expect to find them in the yolk of an egg. These have been found. Scientific research testing the ash of a hen’s egg has brought over ten rare minerals to light. Their amount seems insignificant to us, only 0.75% of the ash of the yolk, but still they are there, and always there. There is an additional 99. 25% of nitrogen, potash, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An interesting point in this connection is that although the scratch yard of the chickens may have only a very small quantity of certain rare minerals in its soil, perhaps a few ounces to the acre in some cases, yet each egg will never lack its very small portion. Su My the chicken has not procured these elements from its food and deposited them in the egg by chance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The total amount of rare minerals is only twenty-two thousandths of a grain per whole egg. Three-fourths of this consists of one element, zinc, which is used commonly in dry batteries and to protect iron from rusting in galvanized coatings. The weight of this zinc in one yolk is about one milligram (metric) or 0.015 of a grain (troy). The other elements are in much smaller amount, for instance, the nickel of the egg totals only 0.0003 of a grain. Other elements are silver, lead, molydenum, copper, cobalt, and of course iodine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Insignificantly small as these elements seem to be, they are not unimportant, for the average man requires but one six-hundredth of a grain of iodine daily, and one seven-millionth of a grain is one of the most important factors in keeping the little chicks so lively and quick. Poultrymen have learned to feed unrefined salt to chickens because of the iodine content which is removed by the refining process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By feeding natural egg ash together with other food to chickens some remarkable results were noticed. One clucking hen stopped brooding within an hour and laid an egg. Treated food was all eaten up by a flock, while the untreated food by its side was left untouched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was found that by feeding the hens minerals the egg yield was increased; reducing the dope reduced the egg yield;, and stopping it altogether caused the stimulated hens to drop below normal in their egg yield and put them in a molt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When synthetic ash, made from materials purchased in a supply house was tried, a noticeable improvement could be seen, but nothing to compare with the results obtainable from minerals which had been through the living process. Evidently the living processes brought- about some change which is not present in the ordinary mineral element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Research to discover this change is now going on. It is not uncommon, even now, to find poultrymen feeding buttermilk and cod-liver oil to their flock. Learning the proper food to feed the birds will result in increased knowledge to us as to what we should eat; and as the golden age draws on, all the necessary knowledge will be revealed.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Alucol Not Approved</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font10"> LUCOL, made in Switzerland, is a fancy name for aluminum hydroxide, about which, at this time, the readers of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font10">probably know more than the readers of any other magazine in the world. It is put up in tablet form, an inert drag being used to enable it. to be handled as a tablet. Extravagant claims were made for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Aluminum in City Drinking Water </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Chas. T. Betts </span><span class="font9">An Opinion .</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font10">AKE this test: Fill a clean drinking glass with city water in which aluminum (metal) sulphate (sulphuric acid) is used as a ‘purifier’. Pour the water out and let the glass dry by evaporation. Repeat this several times each 'day for one week. You will find that the aluminum sulphate has burned into and caused a coating to accumulate on the glass, which substance can not be removed by washing. The writer believes that the extremely small quantity of aluminum sulphate required to produce this effect upon glass, indicates the presence of enough poisonous aluminum sulphate in the city water to be a real menace to the human body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another large outlet for aluminum is afforded by the practice, quite too general, of placing sulphuric acid mixed with aluminum (aluminum sulphate) in the water supply of large and small cities. It is claimed, of course, by health, authorities who approve this practice, that the quantities used are so small that no harm can come from drinking such water. My own and other experiments indicate that this is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The City of Toledo, for example, purchased in December, 1926, 2,200 tons of aluminum sulphate at a cost of $55,000, a supply calculated to last but a few months. The following was taken from the Toledo (Ohio) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times, </span><span class="font10">December 2, 1926:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Expenditures of $55,000 to purchase 2,200 tons of aluminum sulphate for the division of . water was approved by council finance committee Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But if this quantity should be spread over a whole year it would average about twelve pounds for each inhabitant, a pound a month. One ounce of this poisonous substance might produce death! It will be properly argued, of course, that not all of a city’s water supply is consumed by the people. Part of it is admittedly sprinkled on lawns, probably to their detriment. Is there, however, any justification for contaminating the public’s sole source of water supply with a deadly poison in the name of “sanitation” or “hygiene”? Dr. H. G. Wells testified before the Federal Trade Commission (Docket No. 540) that “there are cases reported in the literature of death following the taking of 30 grams (approximately one ounce) of alum in solution”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In spite of the known and ascertainable facts many cities use aluminum sulphate, chlorine, chloride of lime, etc., in the general water supply. This may be a good thing for the manufacturers of these products, but what about the effects upon human health?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a tendency to retain or aggregate these inorganic poisons and irritants in the human body, for they are not readily eliminated, especially by subnormal persons. This makes the matter of accumulations in the body one of serious consequence and worthy of protective public action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Accumulations are irritants, and, if unabated, irritants produce a fine soil for the development of cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The striking increase in the incidence of calculi (gall stones, kidney stones, gravel, etc.) as well as of cancer, doubtless bears close relation to this causation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font10">E SELECT a few paragraphs from the letters sent out by the Emergency Committee for Strikers’ Relief, 156 Fifth, Avenue, New York city. It outlines what the soft coal miners passed through in their futile efforts to establish a six-hour day and a five-day week of steady occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Over four thousand families are already living in wooden barracks or erecting tents for the winter. They aro rough, hastily constructed barracks---little sheds, which are freezing cold because they are neither plastered nor papered. Snow drifts through the big cracks in the walls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suffering is intense. After months without w'ork, hunger is becoming a terrible menace. Babies have not tasted milk since spring; families are on starvation rations; many mothers can not leave their shacks because they have nothing warm to wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life in the barracks becomes more and more unbearable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recent rains turned the low lands where the barracks are built into swamps. The women and children sink knee-deep in mud to reach their shanties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many reports of no coal to cook with or keep warm by. In instances, drainage from the hillsides makes the water ooze through the barrack floors, making it impossible for the children to play on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Water for cooking and washing has to be carried great distances from common wells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A special campaign for money is being made in several mining camps to buy felt paper to line the barracks and close the cracks and guard against coming cold spells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every mining committee visiting our office requests shoes for the children. Thousands of children are out of school because they have no shoes or stockings to wear. In some instances the younger children who do not go to school can not leave the shacks because of lack of shoes. Investigations of our relief committee of the barracks shows family after family without a mouthful of food. In. the homes children were found in bed to keep warm because they had no clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.Diseases and epidemics are spreading. In one camp all the children are confined with whooping cough. Colds, diphtheria and measles are widespread. Influenza and pneumonia are increasing among the adults, due to the exposed life and insufficient warmth and food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Expectant mothers look forward with dread to the birth of their children because of the lack of medical attention, low level of sanitation, and because they will have no food and no strength to take care of their babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Uncleanliness of the children and families is increasing because of lack of soap and water and the impossibility of washing clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Striking miners come day after day to the picket lines without the opportunity of washing their faces or hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The school children are sent home from, school because from lack of nourishment they are too weak to attend to their lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Families have been found who have lived on an exclusive cabbage diet for two weeks. In some places families have existed on an exclusive bean diet for weeks. These families are so tired of this diet that they feel they will starve to death if their diet is not changed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font10">PEAKING in the Queen’s Hall, London, on</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">October last, Mr. Lloyd George said: “'See what is happening in Europe; international disputes and hatreds and great preparations for war give you the feeling that unless reason prevails you will have a repetition of the catastrophe of 1914 in a more terrible form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“There is a shadow, of dark apprehension over Europe today. Are there any serious dangers to peace? They are many; they are grave. You will never convince the people of Great Britain and the people of Europe of the essential needs for the League of Nations unless you tell them the facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Clyde Pilots</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font10">HE passing of the modern liner carrying hundreds of passengers down the River Clyde is a fascinating sight to those -who witness it from the shore; and it becomes even more fascinating when one thinks of the hands that guide the vessel to the wider and safer waters of the Firth, namely, those of the Clyde pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While most of those on board are occupied with the novelty of their surroundings or are having what may be their last glimpse of the Clydeside, the pilot stands on the bridge, his whole attention occupied with the navigation of the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is no simple task. To be a pilot a man must have good nerves and sound judgment, in addition to numerous other qualifications. An error on the open seas may be put right by subsequent observation; but there is little escape for rectifying an error when piloting in a river like the Clyde, and that error may result in damage amounting to thousands of pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is well known that the Clyde is no easy river from the point of view of navigation, with so many large liners entering the harbor. These vessels have to be moved in narrow waters, in some places there being but 200 feet of channel to work in. In addition, that great enemy of all seamen, fog, has frequently to be faced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the men ■who do this work must possess the highest qualifications. To become a Clyde pilot</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a man must serve what may be termed an apprenticeship extending over eleven years. First of all, he must be a natural-born British subject and under thirty-five years of age. He requires to have had at least eight years of experience at sea, and to have been master or chief officer of a ship, and possess a master’s certificate of competency for the foreign trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are fifty pilots on the river. The Glasgow men take the vessels out of the port, leaving them at Gourock or, if desired, proceeding further with them; the Gourock men take charge of incoming vessels to Glasgow, a distance of almost thirty miles. When the pilot boards a ship he has full charge of the navigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is interesting to note that whereas a Clyde pilot may become the captain of a ship in any part of the world, a captain can not undertake the duties of a Clyde pilot until he has undergone three years’ training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On an average, the Clyde pilot performs 320 acts of piloting in the course of a year, and these are carried out at various hours during the day and night and on Sundays. Pilotage charges on the Clyde are stated to be cheaper than in several other ports.</span></p>

In the report for 1927 the £300 mark has been reached. No mention is made of the free manse. No doubt the reverend parsons will be asking this in their prayers for 1928. No mention is made of any good this huge sum is doing in keeping up a large number of professional beggars whose Union or Society is enabling them to live on the fat of the land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font10">HE city of Tacoma has been in the power business for nearly forty years. It owns two magnificent hydro-electric plants and a steam plant. Its system has a book value of about $15,000,000. There is only a little over $3,000,000 debt on this system, represented by utility bond issues, the average maturities of which are now about seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Its financial set-up defies criticism. The city of Tacoma is today selling the cheapest light and power in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have interested myself in the power question for many years, because Washington is blessed with one-sixth of all the hydro energy in the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tacoma is now enjoying a program of industrial expansion, made possible by remarkably cheap rates given to manufacturing plants, which run down to about 3.9 mills per kilowatt hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The home owner shares in this cheap power, for most of the current consumed in the homes in this city is at the rate of 1 cent per kilowatt hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Selling current at these prices enabled the city of Tacoma to show a net profit on operations of nearly $1,000,000 for 1925. In March, 1926, the city made a horizontal cut of practically 20 percent on all electric rates. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the city of Tacoma had charged its people the same rate for current (all schedules combined) as is charged the people of Yakima, Wash., a. city of 20,000 people, served by a private company, the revenues of our light department would have been increased over $3,000,000 in 1925, which was the year we made this comparison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The total tax budget for Tacoma for 1928 is about $2,400,000. You will observe that by merely compelling our people to pay the rate exacted in a neighboring city w<sup>7</sup>e could run Tacoma without the levy of one dollar tax and have over half a million dollars left in the city treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people of Yakima are constantly assured by publicity men of the power trust that their rates are “reasonable”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">State regulation of rates has become a stench in this state as well as in every other state. The “reproduction cost” doctrine has been approved by the Supreme Court of the United States, and this will still further aggravate an already rotten situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Public ownership of water power is the only solution of this vexatious problem.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">To my mind it was the preachers who were indecently and shockingly sacrilegious. Heading a stamp speech at God from a piece of paper and calling it prayer would seem to be about the find, depth of hypocrisy. Not to speak of one reverend gentleman who favored heaven with, some red-hot election bulletins, notifying, the Deity of the nomination of Herbert Hoover on the first ballot. Strange to say, the impropriety of these “prayers” was so bitterly resented in the press gallery that many correspondents refused to take their seats until they had been delivered. “Delivered” is right.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Problem o:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">TN AN address before the eighteenth annual conference of mayors, held'at Niagara'Falls on the last day of May, Hon. Seabury C. Mastick pointed out that 17j percent of all real estate in New York state is now exempt. Over a halfbillion dollars of religious and cemetery property in that state pays no taxes whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pointing out that this ancient custom of exempting church property from the payment of taxes has no just foundation, Mr. Mastick says: •‘The status of the church has been revolutionized. It lias been separated from the government and is no longer supported from tax moneys. Its membership is entirely a personal matter, and large parts of the population have no religious affiliation where formerly membership was all but universal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr, Mastick then quotes from Hon. Mark</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Tax Exemption ‘</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">Graves, state tax commissioner, and with evident approval, the following proposition: “No matter how worthy a project may be which is exempt it is always possible to think up some-' thing else just as worthy; and furthermore, no matter how worthy a project or an institution may be at a given time, it is by no means certain that this worthiness will be perpetual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is well known by politicians and others that ■ the Roman Catholic Church is in the real estate and laundry business on a wholesale scale, and yet they absolutely refuse to pay taxes on anything which they control in any way. The real reason, therefore, for the exemption of “religious” property from taxation lies in the politicians’. fear of a hoary and corrupt political institution which masquerades under the name of the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font10">N PREVIOUS occasions the proof examined showed that God created man a perfect creature and gave him dominion over the earth and that man by reason of his disobedience lost the right both to life and to.earth’s dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ultimate purpose of this series of lectures is to determine God’s manner of reconciling man to Himself and restoring man to perfection. It therefore becomes important at this stage to determine what is man. Is man mortal or immortal? Does man possess an immortal soul? The proper answer to these questions will enable the searcher for truth to determine whether or not man can be reconciled to God and restored to perfection of mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The origin of man is a secret revealed only by the Word of God. No man could know the truth thereof except from the revelation of God as given in His Word. It would be utterly impossible for a man or men, thousands of years removed from the beginning of the race, to tell how it began unless some record is given by the great Creator. God, the great Creator, is pleased to make known His secret to those who love and serve Him. The secret of the Lord is with them. (Psalm 25:14) David loved and served Jehovah God, and the spirit of the Lord God was upon him and he wrote: “0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! •who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.” (Psalm 8:1,2) The words of David, in the second phrase especially, are prophetic. The Lord foreknew that the modernist wise savants or evolutionist clergy would arise and that these would be instruments of the wicked one and therefore enemies. Consequently He caused David to write that out of the mouth of babes should come strength; thereby meaning that the strength of God’s Word would be proclaimed, not by the great and the mighty and the self-constituted wise but by those who possess the teachable, humble disposition of a babe. And even so we find that these are the ones who are declaring the message of God’s goodness to the people and therefore they are having a part in this wonderful work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the night watches David gazed into the heavenly canopy above and there beheld some of the marvels of God’s creation. How<sup>7</sup> wonderful, grand and sublime they are! Every reverential mind delights to behold them at nightfall. Each planet in its assigned orbit moves noiselessly on and the very obedience thereof to God’s law proclaims the praises of the everlasting Creator. As David beheld these wonders of creation he was moved with adoration and praise. Then he turned his eyes upon himself or men about him and said: “When I consider thy wonders, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!”—Psalm 8:3-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How- different the words of the inspired prophet from those of the modern clergyman. It is manifest that the latter are the instruments of Satan whether or not they know it, because in their arrogance they blaspheme the name of God, turn the people away from Him and serve Satan’s purpose. As a public rebuke to the evolutionists the prophet of God wrote: “Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.”-Ps. 100: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the people study the Word of God for themselves and find the simplicity and beauty thereof they can see -what great hypocrites are the clergymen. But these clergymen have kept the people in ignorance of the Bible. They refuse to teach the people themselves what the Bible says; they turn the mind of the people away from the Bible and warn them to read nothing concerning the Bible that does not come from the pen of one of these pious hypocrites. The Lord has let them go to the limit, and now He is doing His marvelous work in the earth by teaching the people in His own good and loving way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We need only to look at a man to see how marvelously he is made. The framework or</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">QOLDEN</span><span class="font12"> AQE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">skeleton is made of an exact number of bones which perform their function. There is not a superfluous one in. the organism. These are held together by the sinews and muscles which move the bones at will in exact harmony. Covering the muscle and the flesh is a soft, delicate, silky substance we call skin, which gives beauty to the body. Of all intricate electrical systems man has devised none can begin to compare with the 'wonderful nervous system of the human organism. With precision and regulation the blood courses through the arteries and. the veins, giving life to the creature. In the head is a brain, wherein is the seat of the will and mind. By the mind facts are considered and weighed and a decision reached, and then the will directs the action. To the sober-thinking man it is apparent that nothing short of the Infinite One could have formed man. Speaking of the marvelous knowledge displayed in the creation of man the prophet of God exclaimed: “Such knowledge is too wonderful, for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul know-eth right well.”—Psalm 139: 6,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These inspired words of God’s prophet, written long before the wise savants came into existence, should put them, to shame. When the people know the truth these so-called wise men will be in shame and disgrace and in contempt. As man begins to obtain knowledge of the great Jehovah God and His marvelous creation, and of His goodness and loving-kindness toward man, he desires to draw nigh unto God and to learn more about Him. For his encouragement, then, the Lord caused to be written in His Word: “Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.’-’ (James 4:8) Let the pretended Christian then cleanse his hands from dabbling in evolution. Let him purify his heart and cease to be doubleminded. A man who claims to be a Christian and yet holds to the theory of evolution in any manner whatsoever is a double-minded man. Let him learn the truth of the Lord God and follow that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have no hope or anticipation of arousing the modern clergymen out of their drunkenness and stupor to turn them to God; but for the benefit of the people in the common walks of life who love the things that are good and who desire to know God these things are spoken. Let all such with befitting humility and meekness come and seek knowledge at the Word of God and there learn how man was made and what are God’s gracious provisions for man’s future welfare and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">How Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">nDHE earth may be properly said to be the mother of man, because from the elements of the earth the first man was made. Jehovah God created him and gave him life, and therefore God is the Father or Life-giver of the first man. Communing with His beloved Son God said: “Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man. in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”—Genesis 1: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The method of man’s creation is simply and beautifully stated in the Scriptures: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) These words of the inspired Word of God should be the end of all controversy as to man’s origin. No one, therefore, who believes Jehovah and that the Bible is His Word will for one moment seriously consider the &quot;wicked and Goddishonoring doctrine of the evolution of man. It is easy to be seen, therefore, that for a Christian to enter into a discussion with an advocate of evolution of man is casting a foul stain upon the holy name of Jehovah and therefore giving countenance and fellowship to the wicked one in violation of the Scriptures.—Psalm 39:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And now mark the goodness of the great Creator. Intending to create man He first made Eden and in the eastern part thereof planted a garden of perfection and unsurpassed beauty. It contained numerous 'fruits and flowers and its atmosphere was scented with SAveet perfume. The birds of gorgeous plumage and sweet song Avere there. The beasts of the field and the fowl of the air dAvelt there together in perfect peace. There Avas no hot sun to blight the garden in summer, nor driving frozen sleet to mar it in winter. Its very name testifies that it Avas a paradise. It was a fit place for a perfect intelligent creature, who should be its caretaker and its lord, and who should love and adore the great Creator. Then God directed His beloved Logos, His active agent, to take the elements of the earth and form the organism. The beautiful body, perfectly and wonderfully wrought, reposed silently and without life upon the ground. Then God breathed into the nostrils of that organism the breath of lives. The breath inflated the lungs and caused the blood to leap through the arteries. The body was animated and there was a moving, breathing, sentient being which the Lord called a soul,, which, stood upon its feet and went about. That was the first man. That was the direct creation of Jehovah God. That man was perfect, because all the -works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deuteronomy 32: 4) Then God made for man a woman to be his helpmate and his companion. To this perfect pail’ he:gave thes power and authority to produce<sup>1</sup> and bring forth children with the intent and purpose of filling the earth with a happy race of people. The life of the human race proceeded from this first perfect pair which God made. Adam, the prince, with Eve, his princess, graced the garden of the Lord. Sixty centuries ago that marvelous work was done. Had not sin entered into Eden to mar its beauty and destroy man’s life, what would we behold today? Thousands of millions of perfect human beings on the earth, all strong, vigorous, beautiful and liappy, all praising Jehovah God, dwelling together in peace and being a comfort and joy io one another. Instead the very opposite is seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was ambitious Lucifer that destroyed the beauty of that paradise home. Since then his jftames have been and are, Satan, Serpent, Dragon and Devil. In Eden he became a liar and murderer, and he lias practised and instigated crime ever since. He it is that blinded man to the truth concerning God and His loving-kindness. God has sutiered him. to take his own evil, course until His due time to restrain him. That happy day is beginning and soon Satan will be completely restrained, and then all the people shall know the truth and be free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? Satan’s first lie, and that by which lie caused the downfall of man, was: ‘There is no death.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ This was a means to induce the practice of evil, advising man that he would continue to live for ever because immortal. Today the clergy, who claim to represent God and teach the people that every man has an immortal soul, are continuing to tell and to practise Satan’s first lie, ‘There is no death.’ It is apparent to any one that evolution and inherent immortality are inconsistent doctrines. Notwithstanding, the clergy teach both, either one of which discredits Jehovah in the mind of the student. Who would be specially interested in causing the people to believe this false doctrine? Satan the Devil, of course; because if man had never been created perfect, and had not fallen, there would be nothing to reconcile. If man had an immortal soul or were inherently immortal, there could be no such tiling as reconciliation. If man were immortal and indestructible, the wicked would not care to be reconciled but would continue for ever, and the good would not need to be reconciled. Both doctrines so confuse the minds offe honest people that they can not understand that Jehovah has a plan of reconciliation. The great pivotal doctrine of the divine plan is the death and resurrection of Jesus, whereby the redemptive price is provided. Both the doctrine of evolution and that of eternal torture are exaci ly opposed to the doctrine of redemption. If the student can always keep in mind that the Devil’s chief purpose is to keep man alienated from God, then it is easy to understand why these false doctrines are promulgated. It may be laid down as a certain and absolutely safe rule that if a teaching or doctrine is inconsistent with the Bible, and particularly the redemption of man through Christ Jesus, that doctrine is false. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another false doctrine that has grown out of ‘inherent, immortality’ is that of eternal torture of the wicked. Of course life must be perpetual Tn order for torment to be perpetual; hence the two doctrines of the immortality of the soul and eternal torture must stand or fall together. Both being false, they must fall. The Word of God is truth, and in due time must prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God’s inspired prophet wrote concerning man: “Thou has made him a little lower than the angels.” This, being true, disproves the doctrine of evolution and the doctrine of inherent immortality. . If man were inherently<sup>7 </sup>immortal, and the angels, are higher than man, then it would follow that angels are immortal. The Scriptures show that the angels are not immortal Many of the angels in the day of Noah fell from the way of purity and became very wicked. (Genesis 6: 2-4; 1 Peter 3:19, 20) God imprisoned many of such angels. (Jude 6; 2 Peter 2: 4) God declared that in His own due time “all the wicked will he destroy”. (Psalm 145:20) The chief amongst these wicked ones is He 'Devil, that angel of great light and power. The fact that these wicked angels will be destroyed is conclusive proof that-they are not immortal. The Devil, the chief amongst them, it is expressly stated in the Scriptures, God will destroy. (Hebrew's 2:14; Ezekiel 28:19) The fact that man is lower than the angels is another proof that man is not immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If man were a creature of evolution, then t,h.e angels must also be creatures of evolution, because the Scriptures compare the creation of the two and state that man is on the lower plane. Besides, the Scriptures say that God made the angels and also mg.de man, and the fact that God made them is proof that neither the angels nor man were evolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Human experience proves that man walks about, breathes, and performs his usual functions. If an accident befalls him his breath is taken away completely, the body no longer functions, and the man is dead. This experience, well known to be common to all men. is exactly in harmony with the Word of God. The Scriptures declare that God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and a living soul resulted. Take away the breath of life and the blood ceases to circulate, action of the heart stops, and the man is dead. It w’as God’s holy power that made man and gave him the breath of life. The power of God exercised takes away the breath of life and therefore death ensues. Upon this point note the scripture: “The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.” (Job 33:4) “'Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.” —Psalm 104:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thai no part of man remains alive after breath goes out of the body is positively proven by the Scriptures. “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.”—Psalm 146:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The breath is invisible and powerful, even as the wind is invisible and powerful. It is the breath of life which God gave to man that moves into action his blood. Without the circulation of the blood there w<sup>T</sup>ould be no life. This is true because the life is in the blood. (Leviticus 17: 14). Take away the blood of man and death results. That of itself proves that man is not immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Man is a soul. The terms man, being,, creature and soul mean the same thing. (Genesis .2:7) If immortal, of course the soul could not die, because immortality means that which is not subject to death. On this point there is no room for doubt, because the Scriptures in plain phrase say: “The soul that sinnethit shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”—Psalm. 89: 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Immortality resides in Jehovah alone. He is from everlasting to everlasting. Jehovah could give to whomsoever Jie wills the quality of im-_ mortality. His Word proves that it is His will to give immortality only to those who have undergone a severe trial and proven their loyalty and faithfulness to Him even unto death. When Jesus was on earth He said: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:26) This proves that at that time Jesus did not possess immortality. Life within oneself, or inherent life, means immortality; and Jesus declared that it was God’s purpose to give Him inherent life or life within Himself. The Scriptures openly declare that “God only hath immortality”. (1 Timothy 6:16) Because of Jesus' faithfulness under the most severe test, even to an ignominious death, God raised Him up out of death and rewarded Him by granting to Him the great prize of immortality, and over Him death can never again have any power. (Philippians 2:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:53; Revelation 1:18) These scriptures prove that Jesus did not possess immortality prior to His resurrection to the divine nature. Jesus the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation. No one was higher. If God did not give His first creature, His great Son the Logos, immortality in the first instance it would be unreasonable that He would make man an immortal creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These emphatic Scriptural statements put to silence the evolution theory of man’s creation. They also conclusively disprove the claim of the clergy that man is part human and part divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The truth, in God’s Word is always harmonious. It states that God made the earth for man and made man for the earth and made man out of the elements of the earth. Being a creature of Jehovah, the first man was perfect and was given a dominion and made the prince of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are two statements concerning the creation of man made in the Genesis account. The first is a general statement of the fact that God created man in His own image and likeness. The second is the more specific statement as to the manner or method of creation. Both statements are simple and are exactly in harmony with each other. God made man a creature of the earth and for the earth exclusively and with no promise or prospect of heaven. His nature was that adapted exclusively to the earth. He was made of flesh, blood and bones; and the scripture states that flesh, blood and bone are not to be in heaven, or the invisible part of God’s realm.—Luke 24:39; 1 Cor. 15: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Man being made in the image and likeness of his Creator, and being perfect, necessarily his attributes or essential qualities of being were justice, wisdom, love and power. He was made an intelligent creature. He knew that to violate God’s law was wrong. The man in Eden was therefore responsible to God. The deliberate violation of God’s expressed W’ill would necessarily call for punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To man God had declared His will when He said: Tn the day that you sin you shall surely die.’ That declaration put man upon trial. The prince of Eden might do anything that w<sup>T</sup>ould bring him pleasure, but he must not show his disregard for the expressed will of Jehovah. Both the prince and his princess were on trial and they were fully advised in advance what would be the penalty for wrong-doing. Regardless of how much suffering it gave Jehovah to inflict the punishment of death upon this perfect pair, He must do so because His Word was at stake. When the infraction, of the law was admitted the infliction of the death penalty was the only thing that could be done. God pronounced that penalty immediately but deferred the complete enforcement thereof for many years. During the time of the pronouncement of the penalty and its complete enforcement the offspring of the first pair came into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan and his agencies on the earth would make man believe that God sentenced Adam to a lake of fire where he and his offspring must be consciously tormented for ever. God could not have entered such a judgment against man nor inflicted upon man such cruel torture. To have done so would mean that God changed the penalty of His law after the commission of the crime, which would have been unjust. God can not be unjust, because justice is the foundation of His throne. (Psalm 89:14) No good could possibly have resulted from endless conscious torment. Besides, only a fiend could inflict such, cruel punishment. God is love, which is the very opposite of fiend. Satan would have men believe that God is a great monster, and his purpose is to turn the minds of men away from God and cause them to abhor Him. Furthermore, if the punishment inflicted upon man was and is eternal torment, then man’s reconciliation to God would be absolutely impossible. If man should ever be brought back into full harmony with God, that of itself would completely disprove the eternal torment theory. It seems strange that sensible men could have any difficulty in seeing this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another false theory held out by many professed Christians is that the offspring of Adam were involved in the original judgment God entered against Adam and were sentenced to the same punishment that w<sup>7</sup>as inflicted upon Adam. Reasoning upon this basis, the conclusion was reached that all must go to eternal torment unless there was some divine intervention in their behalf. But the judgment of God against Adam was not entered against his children. At the time of the judgment against Adam no children had been born; therefore Adam’s children could have had no knowledge of the judgment. It would be inconsistent with Jehovah and His justice to enter a judgment against any one without his knowledge. Why then have the children of Adam died and why do they continue to die? It is written: “Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.” (Romans 5:14) Moses marked the time of the giving of the law of God to the Israelites. The transgression of that law meant death to those who were bound by the law. But before that men died even though they had not committed a deliberate sin as did Adam. Why then, if they were not directly involved in the judgment, should the children of Adam die? The death of Adam’s children was the natural result of Adam’s wrong-doing. The perfect man Adam did not beget children. It was after Adam was undergoing the sentence of death that he begot his children. Adam was then imperfect and could not beget a perfect offspring. The result was that all his children were born imperfect. God can not approve an imperfect thing. For this reason the children, being born imperfect, were sinners and under condemnation or disapproval because of sin. They were sinners, not from choice as was Adam, but because they could not avoid it. They were born sinners because their parents were imperfect, —Psalm 51: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To be sure there are degrees of sin amongst men. There are some who are very greatly depraved and who are a burden to themselves and to their fellow men. There are others who by nature are far above the average in honesty and in purity of thought and action. They are called noble and good amongst their fellows; but both the greatly depraved man and the one last described are sinners in the sight of God and were born such. Every babe is a sinner by inheritance as it is stated by the inspired writer of the scripture. (Romans 5:12) Every sinner or imperfect creature is estranged from God because God can not approve sin, which is manifest in all imperfect creatures, because sin is a transgression of His law. (Habakkuk 1:13; 1 John 3:4) No creature could live for ever unless that creature had the approval of God, because all right to life proceeds from Jehovah. All the human race being born imperfect because of Adam’s sin, it follows that all the human race must perish unless some provision be made to reconcile the race to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reconciliation of man to God would mean that man must be made right with God and brought into full harmony and peace with the great Creator. Such would mean the justification of man. No man could make provision for justification or reconciliation. No man could by his own efforts make himself right wfith God. There must be a competent author of reconciliation and provision must be made for the reconciliation of man to God and the terms and provision of reconciliation must be entirely consistent with Jehovah.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Broadcasting Record</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font10">OST editors are asleep at the switch, determined that as the new era comes in it shall not be said of them that they knowingly did one thing to help it along, but that they did everything humanly possible to give it a bad name and a black eye. Not all editors are thus obtuse, however. Occasionally one is both, able and willing to see beyond the pay-envelope and the orders of the man higher up. Our readers will enjoy the following editorial from the Ypsilanti </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Press,</span><span class="font10"> of August 23, and will wonder why there were not more editors who had the nerve to say something about the biggest news item that ever matured in the city of Detroit, even if, to hoodwink the people, the news columns were closed by the associated conspiracy which masquerades as a news distributing association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are complaints that radio broadcasting is being “commercialized”. A certain degree of commercialism is inevitable, to provide enough financial support for radio to carry on its other work of im-mixed education and entertainment. But how shall we classify the religious use of radio, paid for at regular rates?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a remarkable fact that the biggest radio hookup yet accomplished, reaching the largest number of people, is in the nature of religions propaganda. Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, former Missouri lawyer, now evangelical preacher along non-denominational lines, broadcasting an address from Detroit, uses 96 stations for an hour and a half. That, is almost, twice as many as have been used for any other previous event. It enormously surpasses any previous appeal to the ears of humanity, almost reaching the facilities of the angel Gabriel-—except that in this ease the appeal is only to the living, and they need not hear if they do not choose to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When religion can command such an audience, there need be little fear of its being crow’ded out, by other forms of appeal to the interest of mankind.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Most Successful Broadcast in Radio History</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">U</span><span class="font10">NDER the above heading the Vancouver</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Star</span><span class="font10"> of August 8, publishes a letter from the pen of G. Russell which it is rather remarkable that they had the moral courage to do. The publication of the letter is all the more to be wondered at because the newspapers generally, over the entire country, completely fell down on the job. They dared not do anything else, because the word has evidently gone out to knife the Judge. Well! Let them go ahead. The cowardly press associations never take up with any reform until it is crammed down their necks—hide, hair, horns, feathers, hoofs and all. One of these times the newspapers will be wholly relegated to the places on the cellar shelves, where they now belong. And then the Lord will come into His own. </span><span class="font8">Editor, Morning Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sir—It must often be a matter of puzzlement to the average newspaper reader as to why certain incidents of seemingly extraordinary interest are given insignificant publicity, while others, apparently of relatively less importance, are featured under imposing headlines. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It appears to me that altogether too little reference has been made in the Vancouver press to the remarkable feat accomplished by the radio and telephone engineers of this continent when, on Sunday morning, through a vast and most complicated net. work of telephone and telegraph lines linking over 100 broadcasting stations in the United States and eight in Canada, the speech of Judge Rutherford before the Detroit convention of the International Bible Students’ Association was made distinctly audible to every owner of a radio receiver in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moreover, two American eastern stations, working on short-wave transmission, were simultaneously &quot;passing the good word” on to European broadcasting stations for instantaneous retransmission to European listeners-in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here, in Vancouver, we sat and listened to Judge Rutherford and other speakers, to say nothing of excellent music and singing, from 6: 30 a.m. till 8 a.m. through CKMO, the Sprott-Shaw station that represented British Columbia in this gigantic hook-up-. Every detail came through with astounding clearness —few local broadcasts have ever been clearer—and it was indeed hard to realize that the well-advertised city of Detroit was so far away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is. in all probability, the most far-reaching and successful simultaneous broadcast in the history of radio—a definite mile-stone in the march of scientific development—and one has to search carefully through the local papers to find any record of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The International Bible Students’ Association are to be congratulated on the result of the $50,000 spent by them on this most successful &quot;stunt”; the 500 telephone engineers responsible for the setting-up and maintenance of the network have good reason to be proud of themselves; CKMO, our local station, enhanced its reputation; but there is one of your readers who is of the opinion that, in failing to adequately recognize this magnificent effort, Vancouver newspapers have fallen down on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Sacred Name </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By M. M. Freschel</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">P EFERRING to the article &quot;The Lost Name” T* in No. 229 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font10"> a Hebrew Bible student may be permitted to say in return a few words in favor of the name </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font10">as the correctly pronounced Hebrew name for the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only is YEII-HO-VAH the pronunciation that by reverent tradition was preserved up to the present generation of the Jews, and which is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">correct</span><span class="font10"> pronunciation the orthodox Jews in an erroneous conception of Exodus 20:7 avoid uttering (Isaiah 29:13), hut there are also other and even stronger corroborative arguments:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pronunciation &quot;Jahweh” is a &quot;discovery” of the &quot;Higher Critics”. Their arguments to support their claim are undisputably false. Some explain that Jahweh was the name of one of the idols of heathen aborigines of Canaan, and that the Hebrews later adopted this name for their national god. This argument betrays the inspirer of the High Text Criminals. The Devil no doubt is the father of this lie. It is obviously another attempt of the enemy to defame the holy name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Jahwists claim that the later added vowel signs to the sacred name do not belong to it, but to the word ADONAI (Lord). Yet the vowel points of adonai are a-o-a, or the spoken vowels a-o-ai, and the vowel points of Jehovah are e-o-a. This slight similarity proves nothing, but this so-called &quot;scientific proof” looks rather as similar to other so-called &quot;proofs” of a sham science as one egg does to another (for instance, the fallacy of the evolution theory that certain similarities between creatures prove that their species have the same primeval ancestors).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no doubt concerning the correct pronunciation of the Hebrew or real name of Jesus, namely </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">JehoscJiuah</span><span class="font10"> (yeh-ho-shoo’-ah== Jehovah’s salvation). This shows clearly how the sacred name of God is to be pronounced. There are many other Biblical proper names with indubitable pronunciation where Jehovah’s name appears in abbreviated form; for instance, Je/iojada<sub>r</sub> Jelioadah, Jefcoaddin, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jeho-</span><span class="font10">ahaz, Je&amp;oash, Jehohanan,. Jriioiachin, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jeho-</span><span class="font10">iarilty Jebonadab, Jg/mnathan, JeAoram, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jeho-</span><span class="font10">shabeath, Je/mshaphat, Je/mzabad, Jefeozadak, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes the sacred name appears as JAH (yah). This is a contraction of the name JEHOVAH and is repeatedly mentioned simultaneously with the full name. (Isaiah 12:2; 26:4; Exodus 17:16; Psalms 89:8; 122:4) JAH is often used as the end syllable of a proper name, for instance:. Jedidjah, Obadjah, Je-shajah (Isaiah), Jirmijah or Jirmijahu (Jeremiah), etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah has always revealed His name, that is, Himself, as the only true God, first to His servants consecrated unto Him. Would it be reasonable to think that the heavenly Father should have unveiled even the sound or correct pronunciation of His sacred name first to the clergy who dishonor it, instead of to His children, His beloved ones, who extol His name amongst the nations!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark51"></a>“By My Name Jehovah Was I Not Known.<sup>w</sup> </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Fred Franz</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">H</span><span class="font10">AVING: read Mn Freschel’s: foregoing article on Jehovah’s name,: I should like to append thereto the following observations: It no doubt causes wonderment that God’s name, via., JEHOVAH, does not occur in the New Testament, and neither Jesus nor His apostles are recorded as taking the name in their lips. In writing the New Testament in Greek, the writers of the gospels and epistles evidently followed the Greek Septuagint Version of the Old Testament, which also does not use the name Jehovah but uses the word “Kunos”, Lord, in translating the name Jehovah from the Hebrew text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The translators of the King James Version followed this practice, so that in the entire Authorized Version the name “Jehovah” occurs only seven- times, viz., four times by itself and three times in combinations such as Jchovah-nissi, Jehovah-shalom and Jehovah-jireh; and the name “Jah” occurs only once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Catholic version and Luthers translation followed the same method of translating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of the above the name Jehovah be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">amongst the Christian churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Lord unquestionably arranged the omission of His name “Jehovah” from the New Testament, and has permitted the Christian churches throughout this era to overlook God’s outstanding name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prior to 191.8 A.D. even those in &quot;present truth” used the name meagerly, and its full significance and glory was not understood by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus of a truth it has been with Christiane as well as with all Christendom and heathendom that “by my name Jehovah was I not known unto them”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But now that the day is at hand to make a name for Himself, He has overruled that some modern translations, like the American .Revised Version, the German “Miniaturbibel” and “Parallelbibel”, etc., do not translate “Jehovah.” by the word “Lord”, but take the name bodily that the antitypical Moses is present for the deliverance of God’s people and the common people, He is making Himself known to them by His “great and terrible name” Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is an interesting and yet unmistakable parallel, and also helps us to understand how Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah,.and others of their day knew and used the name “Jehovah”; as for instance when “Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh” (Genesis 22:14); and yet God says in Exodus 6:3: “Unto Abraham, and Isaac, and. unto. Jacob , . . by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.” So, too, Christians knew the name, at least the sounds of if, before 1918, and yet they did not kuow.il,: i.e., the significance, the might and glory of it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Bible Questions and Answers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">/‘XpESTlON:</span><span class="font10"> Was Mary, the mother of Je</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sus, a Jewess, and can it be proved that she was a descendant of David?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font10"> Yes. The Scriptures are very plain in this matter. By careful examination it will be found that the line of descent in Luke 3:2338 is of Jesus through His mother Mary, and not through Joseph. On the other .hand the genealogy recorded in Matthew 1:1-16 is that of Joseph. Some readers of the Bible may carelessly take both of these records as the genealogy of Joseph, but such is not the case. A difference in these two accounts is apparent to the close observer. We will note that the 16th verse of the first chapter of Matthew states, “And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called ChristIt is definitely settled by this scripture that Jacob was the name of the father of Joseph. Now, turning to Luke 3:23 we note that the name of the father of Jesus’ parent there mentioned is not Jacob, but Heli; and that Heli is not mentioned at all as an ancestor of Joseph in the Matthew account. The clew to the proper understanding is that Joseph was made the son by marriage, in the legal sense the son-in-law of Heli, who was the father of Mary. The correct thought of Luke 3:23 is that Joseph Avas the son-in-law of Heli. It will be noted in the two accounts that both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David, but Joseph’s line of descent is through David’s son Solomon, while Mary’s genealogy is through Nathan. This was exactly in accordance with the desire of the Lord, that on account of Solomon’s disloyalty to the Lord in turning to other gods the promised one who would sit upon the throne of David should not be a descendant of Solomon. Concerning Solomon’s descendant Coniah or Jelioiaehin, who had deflected from the Lord, it is written in Jeremiah 22: 30: “Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling anymore in Judah.” Our Lord Jesus did not come through Solomon’s line, but through that of Solomon’s brother Nathan. Only the legal heirship came through Solomon, through his descendant Joseph, the legal or foster-father of Jesus. Therefore the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bible clearly proves that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a Jewess and a descendant of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> What are the meanings of the expressions “creation” and “new creature in Christ Jesus”</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer;</span><span class="font10"> The word “creation” is allied to the Latin word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">creatus,</span><span class="font10"> meaning created, and akin to the Sanskrit word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">kri,</span><span class="font10"> which means to make. When speaking of creation in the Bible sense we refer to the work of God as outlined in the first two chapters of Genesis'. This work will be brought to perfection through Jehovah’s appointed Agent, the Son of God, Christ Jesus. .When speaking of the “new creature” in Christ Jesus we refer to the Christian as a spirit-begotten individual. A new creature in Christ Jesus is one who has determined to do the will of Jehovah God. He has been planted into Christ Jesus by the heavenly Father; he recognizes Christ Jesus as his Head; and he has been begotten by the heavenly Father by His holy spirit. In 2 Corinthians 5:17 we read, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old tilings are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Is it true that Christ was accepted in the Catholic church, the Roman Catholic church, so called, up to the time of His death ? Is this so, and was the Roman Catholic church in existence at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font10"> We can answer, No, to both of these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The gospel of Christianity had not gone to Rome up to the time that Jesus died: hence there could have been no Roman church. There could have been no Catholic church at that time, because “catholic” means “universal”, and by God’s own decree (Daniel 9: 26, 27) the gospel of true Christianity was confined exclusively to the Jews for three and one-half years after ‘Messiah, the Christ, was cut off’ in death. It was then that the Christian gospel first went to the non-Jews or Gentiles, and Cornelius, a centurion, was the first Gentile convert. He lived at Caesarea in Palestine, and not at Rome. There is no reliable, genuine history, as well as no Bible scripture, to prove that Peter ever got to Rome to preach the gospel of Christ there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Story Fourteen</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font10">N OUR last story we learned how John the Baptist witnessed to all the people concerning the coming of the Lord Jesus, and how Philip, and Andrew, and Peter first met the Lord. This was the beginning of Jesus’ minis- , try, and shortly thereafter He began to do wonderful things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>:</sup> Jesus performed His first miracle in Cana ©f Galilee. A miracle is an act &quot;which can not be performed by any ordinary means, and which leads to a result which is usually considered impossible. For example, no human being, that is, no .ordinary human being like you or meg-can walk on water. ..Nor can we turn ordinary water into wine, or raise dead people unto life again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">,Yet Jesus did all these things and many more wonderful ones. And Jesus, during His ministry on earth, was a perfect human being. So how can we explain the reason for the miracles which Jesus performed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">; Do you remember that when Jesus was bap\ tized in the River Jordan, the holy spirit came down from...heaven and alighted upon His head in the form of a dove? The holy spirit, as we already know, is the invisible hand or power of Almighty God, Jehovah, the Planner and Crea- ■ tor of the universe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Jesus received the holy spirit at Jordan it enabled Him to perform thenceforth the marvelous things which He did. not for show or advertising purposes, but that ail might see that lie was the Son of God. Jesus did not perform a miracle as a magician docs a trick, for every one to wonder at and applaud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus had a purpose in each miracle that He-, performed. The purpose of the first miracle, i that in Cana of Galilee, was to strengthen the f faith of His newly-found disciples, that they | might indeed see and believe that He was the Savior. The Bible storv of tlds. .first ’ which was an important event in the life of Jesus, is found hi John 2:1-U. We quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘•And the third day [after Jesus met Philip and the other disciples] there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And when they wanted wino, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. Has iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiio</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, From this account of Jesus’ first miracle wo /are able at once- to note two very important /items that will give us a clear view of the mod-jesty and glory of the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It will be noticed that Jesus spoke kindly to the servants, and told them simply to carry the wine in to their master. He did not say, ‘Tell your master that Z turned this water into wine, and that I am the most wonderful person in the world,’ or something to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It will also he noticed that the wine itself was so very excellent that the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom to him and praised him for providing such splendid wine al the end of the feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And then we see that the faith of His disciples was greatly strengthened, for they were present to witness the miracle, and then, as the Bible says, they “believed ou him” that He was really and truly the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After this Jesus went down into Capernaum, a city at some little distance, to make a short visit. The Bible .says He “continued there not many days”. It does not give any record of His actions while at Capernaum, but informs us that His mother and brothers and disciples accompanied Him on the journey. It was near the Passover time, so we may suppose that Jesus was there preparing to go to Jerusalem, which, is where we shall find Him in our next story.</span></p>

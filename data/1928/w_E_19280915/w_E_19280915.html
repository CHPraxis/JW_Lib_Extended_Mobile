<p><span class="font6">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Toweb Bible and Tract Society</span><span class="font4"> for the purpose of aiding the people to understand the divine plan. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font4"> announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH </span><span class="font4">is the only true God, the Maker of Leaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; iliat the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD </span><span class="font4">created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JESUS </span><span class="font4">was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man ; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine arose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font4">for many centuries God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and plan of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; </span><span class="font4">that the Lord Jesua has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE HOPE </span><span class="font4">of the peoples of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life and those who obey will live </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark8"></a>THE CONVENTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S government is uppermost in the mind of every one who is anointed by him. The understanding of the anointed is that Jehovah purposes to destroy Satan’s rule and to place the rulership of the ■world in the hands of Christ Jesus his beloved Son. God’s government through Christ will be a righteous government, through which he will bless all the families of the earth. It is for this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">government</span><span class="font5"> of righteousness that Christians have been praying for many centuries: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” The anointed have come to see the importance of making announcement of the incoming government of righteousness because such is the will of God. The kingdom interests, which the Lord has committed into the hands of his anointed, include the work of making announcement of the fall of Satan’s organization and the establishment of God’s righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention of Bible Students for the year 1928 was held at Detroit, Michigan, July 30 to August 6, inclusive. The estimated attendance was between ten and twelve thousand. The public press of Detroit, yielding to the influence of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant, did exactly what was to be expected, namely, ignored the Bible Students’ convention. The publicity by the press was conspicuous by its absence. After the convention was over one of the staff reporters called up to know what was going on at the Coliseum. The lack of publicity on the part of the public press, however, in no way embarrassed the Bible Students. The Society published its own paper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font5"> which paper gave a more complete report than any worldly paper could have given. Many thousands of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font5">readers have the report given by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span><span class="font5"> Subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> came from all parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention was one of service. The anointed went there with the intention of service. Their desires were realized. The convention was addressed by the following speakers: R. J. Martin, J. C. Watt, A. H. Macmillan, T. J. Sullivan, H. Schmid, G. Y. McCormick, J. De Fehr, C. J. Woodworth, H. E. Pinnock, R. G. Green, D. Haslett, V. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C. Rice, M. L.</span><span class="font5"> Hartman, F. W. Franz, II. S. Murray, W. L. Bowen, R. D. Goodrich, B. H. Boyd, H. Smith, Jos. Greig, W. F. McLendon, G. C. Powell, E. B. Sheffield, W. J. Thorn, F. H. Dougherty, R. H. Barber, M. A. Howlett, G. H. Draper, Clifford Roberts, P. II. Harding, L. B. Burtch, W. E. Woodworth, J. A. Baeuerlein, T. F. Silvey, J. Hemery, AV. F. Salter, AV. AV. Johnston, AV. E. Van Amburgh, R. A. Kinninmonth, C. AV. Cutforth, E. J. Coward and J. F. Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every discourse emphasized the blessed privilege and the importance of doing the will of God and that so doing meant to work. Every discourse was timely, helpful and encouraging. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> gave an outline of each one of the discourses. Space in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower </span><span class="font5">will not permit a full report of these discourses. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> carried only a brief outline of the discourses given by the president of the Society and his discourses there will be carried in full in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> in this and subsequent issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE DAYS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two days were set aside for field service, Thursday, August 2 and Saturday, August 4. Thursday was confined strictly to the city of Detroit. On Saturday part of the workers were in the city while the others were in the suburbs and rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the English-speaking brethren attending and participating in the convention, simultaneous meetings were being held by those speaking the following languages, to wit: Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Ukrainian, Russian, German, Polish and Lithuanian. The English and the foreign-speaking brethren participated in the field service. The total number of workers in the field on service days, including English and foreign-speaking brethren, was 4,757. Total number of books and booklets actually placed in the hands of the people on those two service days was, to wit, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">67,261.</span><span class="font5"> In addition to this, many of the brethren took with them books and booklets to dispose of on the return journey to their homes, and this brought the grand total up to more than 100,000 volumes disposed of at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the </span><span class="font5">convention </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">596 </span><span class="font5">colporteurs registered as pres</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ent for </span><span class="font5">service. Eight of these were from England, two from Scotland, two from Ireland, the others from the United States and Canada. In addition thereto, many auxiliary colporteurs were present and participated in the service. During the convention sixty-four new applications for colporteur work were received. This makes the total for colporteur work in the United States 1,911.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">275</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">In this connection it is interesting to compare the first six months of the following years during which books were sold by the colporteurs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1926 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162,624 volumes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1927 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135,496 volumes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1928 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;353,974 volumes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The colporteurs have the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and are manifesting it by their work, and this was shown particularly at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aside from the colporteurs many of the regular class workers engaged in the field service. This included practically all the elders who attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A meeting of the elders was held Thursday afternoon. Never at a convention has there been so much real zeal and devotion to the Lord shown by the body of elders. They not only had been in the service that day but manifested their determination to take the lead in their respective classes in the service throughout the country. It was a blessed meeting and will doubtless result in much good and bring glory to the Lord’s name. A full report of the address given at the elders’ meeting appears in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each evening during the convention the English brethren broadcast a program by radio from seven to eight o’clock. This program consisted of music furnished by the orchestra from WBBR, assisted by others attending the convention, and of vocal music by those at the convention, and a discourse or lecture of from twenty-five to thirty minutes on present truth. The Englishspeaking brethren used station AVGHP. Mr. Kirby, the local manager of the station, and his assistants were very courteous and considerate to those who participated in the Watch Tower programs. They also expressed themselves as highly appreciative of the programs, and favorably commented upon the work being done by the Bible Students. The foreign-speaking brethren also broadcast over other stations. Thus thousands of people in and about Detroit had an opportunity of hearing in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be a trite saying to state that this was the best convention ever held. It would also be a true saying. Not within the memory of any who attended has there ever been a convention in which there was such a united and expressed determination to honor the name of Jehovah God. The convention was better organized than any that we have ever heretofore had, and it was noticeable that everybody was anxious io have something to do and to do it when opportunity was alforded. There was very little time for personal visiting except in the evening after the program of the day had ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this connection </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> takes occasion to say that the president of the Society would greatly appreciate a more personal contact with many of the brethren to talk over their private matters and to visit with them, but he finds it absolutely impossible so to do. The many duties that must be met and performed require all the time and available strength. Readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> and those attending the convention will please take this statement as a personal expression of love from the president to all the dear brethren. While we would love to have personal visits and conversation more than we do, this must be deferred until the Lord’s work on earth is done, and then we shall have the great privilege of attending the general assembly of the first-borns. The King’s business now requires haste and continuity in action. It requires the undivided attention of those who attempt to represent the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention was a blessed one. It enabled those present to get a clearer vision of many of the prophecies that Jehovah is now unfolding to his people. It encouraged others to enter into the service of the Lord and greatly encouraged those who are already in the service. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> in its behalf and in behalf of its readers expresses our joint thanks to Jehovah God for his manifold blessings bestowed upon his people at this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the convention was the program of Sunday morning, August 5. Its importance was enhanced because arrangement had been made for the consecrated who must remain at home, and for the public in general throughout America and Canada and in some of the foreign countries, to hear the program. More than one hundred radio stations broadcast this program from the Coliseum. There has never before been anything equal to it in radio broadcasting. Never before have so many stations been linked together simultaneously broadcasting the same program. Concerning this program </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font5"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most important event that ever happened in Detroit, or in Michigan, or in the United States, or on the American continent, or in the New World, takes place this morning at 9:30 to 11: 00 when Judge Rutherford gives his address on RULER FOR THE PEOPLE over the greatest network of radio stations ever linked together in human history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the United States and Canada the Judge’s epoch-making address will be broadcast simultaneously </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">more than one hundred radio stations, ninety-six of which are linked together by telephone lines. Ten will take the program direct from the air and rebroadcast without the aid of wires. Altogether that will make at least 106 stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The wire network of the ninety-six stations covers </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">33,500 </span><span class="font4">miles of telephone lines, and 91,400 miles of telegraph lines. This would belt the earth five times at the equator. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">would reach more than half way to the moon. It is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font4">comparably the greatest single educational item in the annals of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At 160 points along the network telephone repeaters employing multitudes of vacuum tubes will be included in the talking circuits to increase the volume of the fading voice currents. During the actual period of transmission more than 500 telephone experts will superintend the network, to prevent interruptions and distortions, so far as is humanly possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> concerning the radio network said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most extensive and expensive radio hook-up in history has been arranged for Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, onetime Missouri lawyer, who turned evangelical preacher, according to announcement yesterday from his headquarters in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio network ordered by the lay preacher exceeds even those set up for the President, or for any new news event. The cost could not be ascertained yesterday, but a hint of it lay in the fact that the use of forty-seven stations for an hour cost the Dodge Motor Car Company $42,000 early in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are to be ninety-six stations in the Rutherford connection, and the time to be used will be an hour and a half. It could not be ascertained yesterday whether the huge outlay for the Judge’s talk next Sunday would be borne by his organization, the International Bible Students Association, by himself or by a friendly philanthropist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL SPEAK AT CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evangelist, an uncompromising foe of organized Christianity, successor to the late Pastor Russell, will be the chief speaker at the Bible students’ annual convention to be held in the Coliseum on the Michigan State Fair Grounds, near Detroit. Last year the convention was held in Toronto, and the former Judge, who penned the slogan, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die,” mobilized what was then the largest radio hookup. He had fifty-three stations in line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Previous hookups and the number of stations linked include the Fourth Annual Radio Industries dinner on Sept. 21, 1927, eighty-five stations; reception to Colonel Lindbergh on June 11, 1927, fifty stations; Dempsey-Sharkey fight on July 21, 1927, in the Yankee Stadium, fifty-two stations; Washington’s Birthday speech by President Coolidge in 1927, forty-two stations; Buick broadcast on July 23, fortyeight stations; Tunney-Heeney battle, forty-three stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rental and operation of regular network circuits of the National Broadcasting Company cost $33,000 for the twentyhour period, special transcontinental circuits cost $24,000, approximately 45,OCX) miles of balanced and specially prepared wires being used. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within, a few hours after the conclusion of the program hundreds of telegrams were received from every part of the United States and Canada and all to the effect that the reception was as nearly perfect as possible. Every part of the lecture was heard distinctly and without interruption with but one exception and that was a difficulty due to power trouble in a station. For several days prior to Sunday the weather was exceedingly hot and sultry. An electrical storm prevailed throughout the United States and Canada on Saturday night. Sunday morning it was cool and cloudy. This was decidedly in favor of the broadcasting. The storm removed the static and enabled the program to go out over the ether without interruption. The Lord be praised for this! On the Monday morning following, the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(D. C.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> carried a report under the following heading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BIBLE RADIO CHAIN WITH 100 STATIONS SETS NEW<sup>1</sup> RECORD </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Judge J. F. Rutherford’s Talk at Detroit</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Is Heard by Millions, Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further commenting upon the program the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to its sponsors, the broadcasting of the Sunday morning session of the International Bible Students Association, assembled in convention yesterday morning in Detroit, included more than 100 stations and therefore was the largest in the history of radio. It was heard by Washington listeners through Station WRHF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The principal speaker was Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, at one time a Missouri lawyer, but later became an evangelical preacher and president of the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I had a telegram from one of the New York dailies,” Judge Rutherford said during the course of his address, “asking how much this hook-up cost, and who was paying for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“My answer is tiiat it cost $50,000 and is being paid for by a multitude of Christians throughout the United States who are glad to do it.” At another time the judge remarked, parenthetically, “Satan and the Devil tried to prevent this hook-up, but were unable to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Included among those broadcasting the address were Stations WORD, at Batavia, HI., near Chicago, of 5,000 watts power, and WBBR, at Rossville, N. Y., outside of New York city, both owned by Judge Rutherford’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">First Broadcast of Kind</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hour for the broadcast was set for 9: 30 o’clock in the morning, so as not to be in conflict with the Sunday morning services being broadcast, thus marking the first country-wide broadcast ever made at this unusual time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was said the address was being heard in 36 States, three provinces in Canada, and was being relayed to other countries by short waves from Station WGY at Schenectady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This would have been a wider territory covered than by the Lindbergh hook-up of 50 stations or the national convention of G8 stations, neither of which reached Canada, or tlie proposed Hoover notification hook-up, which at this time comprises 75 stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the convenience of listeners in the Capital loud speakers were installed in the Pythian Temple auditorium, and at several other points in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie visible audience which greeted Judge Rutherford at the Coliseum in Detroit, according to the announcement which came over the radio, numbered more than 12,000 persons. In addition to that loud speakers were placed in Belle Isle Park about 10 miles away in Detroit, where it was said another crowd had assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the special benefit of Australia and New Zealand arrangements were made to have the Sunday morning lecture repeated and broadcast by a short wave from tlie powerful station WGY of Schenectady. The time selected was from four to five o’clock Monday morning. That was deemed by the engineers the most suitable time to reach the far distant lands of Australia and New Zealand. At that early hour the president of the Society appeared at the engineers’ control room at the Coliseum, State Fair Grounds, and repeated the address which he had previously given on Sunday morning. This address was transmitted by telephone wire </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">Schenectady, New York, and from there broadcast by short wave length from one of the most powerful stations in America. Arrangements had been made to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font5">broadcast the lecture over several stations in Australia and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within a short time thereafter cablegrams were received from various parts of Australia and New Zealand, announcing that the reception of the lecture on Monday morning was splendid and was well received in those countries. Cablegrams from Jamaica also were to the same effect. Trinidad, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">B. W. I., also reported </span><span class="font5">splendid reception. Surely it is a miracle of the Lord that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">human voice can be carried to such great distances now. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">is God’s due time. He has supplied the radio for the purpose. The honor and praise is due his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROGRAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harry Howlett, one of the announcers of radio station WHK of Cleveland, Ohio, was selected to make the announcement for the radio hook-up. In order to make connection he traveled by airplane arriving in time </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">take charge of the program. Promptly at 9: 30 a. m. the announcement of the greatest radio network was made and a brief statement of what the program would consist of. Music was furnished by the orchestra, followed by an anthem sung by a chorus of two hundred voices. Then followed the lecture, after which the entire assembly joined in singing the well-known song, “How Firm a Foundation.” Doubtless other hundreds of thousands throughout America and Canada joined in this song. The orchestra concluded the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the great desire of the Bible Students to make </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">clearly understood that they are against the Devil and his organization and wholly devoted to Jehovah God. When the president of the Association was introduced to the seen and unseen audience he said: “Before proceeding with my address I will read a Declaration in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">form of a </span><span class="font5">resolution, move its adoption, and then speak to the Declaration.” He then proceeded to read the Declaration, which is set out herewith in full, after which he delivered his lecture which was heard by millions of people. The resolution was unanimously adopted by the convention. We also publish a full report of the address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of going to press thousands of requests have been received by mail and by telephone for copies of the address. Announcement was made that all who made request for a copy within five days from the time of the broadcast of the lecture would receive one free of charge. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> will carry a full report, and a copy will be sent to those so requesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> takes this occasion to announce that the Society is now printing an English edition of five million copies of the above address and Declaration for distribution amongst the people, and many other millions will be printed in foreign languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1928 convention of the Bible Students is now past. It is hoped, however, that the good work done at Detroit has just begun and that millions of people throughout the earth will receive a blessing therefrom. It is impossible to find words to express a full appreciation of God’s goodness to his people at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let every one of the anointed continue to manifest his appreciation by singing forth the praises of Jehovah. Now his name shall be exalted!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark10"></a>DECLARATION AGAINST SATAN AND FOR JEHOVAH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE Bible Students in international convention assembled do declare themselves against Satan and wholly for Jehovah of hosts, and emphatically announce further these vital truths, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First: That the peoples of earth organized into forms </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">government and under the control of a superior and invisible ruler constitute the world;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Second: That Jehovah is the only true and Almighty God and the source of all just authority; that he is the King Eternal, the God of justice, wisdom, love and power and the true friend and benefactor of all creation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Third: </span><span class="font5">That Jehovah delegated to his son Lucifer the authority to be the overseer of man; that Lucifer became disloyal, rebelled against God and caused man to fall away from righteousness, and since that rebellion Lucifer has been known by the titles Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil; that Satan the Devil has caused strife amongst the nations and is responsible for all the cruel wars, wicked murders, all heinous crimes and other cor</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rupt </span><span class="font5">acts that have been committed; that until now </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font5">ehovah has not restrained Satan from the exercise of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">power and influence over man, to the end that mankind might learn the baneful results of evil doing; that for </span><span class="font5">many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world, constantly defaming the name of Jehovah God and working great injury to men and nations;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fourth: That Jehovah promised that in his due time he would restrain Satan and establish a righteous government in the earth that men might have an opportunity for life everlasting in happiness; and to that end he anointed his beloved Son Jesus to be the redeemer and invisible ruler of the world;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifth: That Jehovah’s due time has come to fulfil his promise and to clear his reputation in the minds of all creation; that Christ Jesus has taken his high office as the executive of Jehovah and the great issue now is, Who is God and who shall rule the peoples and nations ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sixth: That because Satan will not surrender his wicked rule over the nations and peoples of the earth, Jehovah of hosts with his anointed executive officer Christ Jesus will press the conflict against Satan and all of his forces of evil, and henceforth our battle-cry shall be, THE SWORD OF JEHOVAH AND OF HIS ANOINTED; that the great battle of Armageddon soon to begin will result in the full restraint of Satan and the complete overthrow of his evil organization, and that Jehovah will establish righteousness in the earth by and through Christ the new ruler and will emancipate mankind from evil and bring everlasting blessings to all the nations of the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seventh: Therefore the due time has come for all who love righteousness to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and obey and serve him with a pure heart, that they may receive the boundless blessings which the Almighty God has in reservation for them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark12"></a>RULER FOR THE PEOPLE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.”—Ps. 33: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE statements made in the Declaration just read in your hearing are true. Being true, they are of the greatest importance to the people at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">ask the indulgence of the audience, seen and unseen, while I submit proof in support thereof. I have an abiding confidence that when the people know and appreciate the truth a great burden will be lifted from their minds. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">crave an opportunity to have some part in bringing the truth to the attention of the people. In doing so I come to you as a friend of all mankind. I have no selfish interest to serve, save this, that what is for the general welfare of mankind must be for my good. The eternal welfare of men far outweighs all the money by which the commodities of earth are measured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good government is essential to the welfare of all people. It should claim the intense interest of every man and woman. The parents should teach their children the principles of good government. There can be no real progress made in its study unless the matter be approached calmly and without bias or prejudice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all governments of men there is an invisible as well as a visible power exercised for evil or for good. The invisible power is superior to the visible and is therefore the power of control. If evil, then the invisible power so exercised makes the visible unsatisfactory. If the invisible power is exercised for good, then the effect upon the visible power is good and the people are blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world is one vast government made up of the various nations and peoples. In all nations the people have recognized an invisible power that influences the nations’ course of action. When in dire distress the people appeal to the invisible power and thereby acknowledge that the invisible is superior to their visible governors. In harmony with this statement it is written in the Scriptures: “Blessed is the nation whose God [invisible Ruler] is Jehovah.”—Ps. 33:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inference must be indulged from this Scriptural statement that there is an invisible ruling power other than Jehovah God and that when the people are controlled by that power it is not for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All nations recognize the necessity of a visible ruler. The fact that the United States is at this very time engaged in a great campaign to determine who shall be its ruler is proof of that statement. It is deemed important to know something about the visible ruler, and to this end an educational campaign is carried </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on. It </span><span class="font5">is of greater importance to know of and concerning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">invisible ruler, because his influence and power is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">greater </span><span class="font5">than that of the visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">am persuaded that the great masses of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">peoples </span><span class="font5">of earth, regardless of religion or politics, desire to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">and enjoy a just and righteous government. Seeing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">man is not perfect, and that there is an invisible power that influences him, it is vital to ascertain in whom righteous power resides and who is the dispenser of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">evil </span><span class="font5">power. In discussing this matter there is no disposition to reflect upon men. Bible Students have no desire </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">inclination to fight any man or company of men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Their </span><span class="font5">desire is to place the truth clearly before the minds </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the people. When the truth is understood it will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">found that the interests of all men are alike. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I now </span><span class="font5">submit the proof that there is an evil god that controls the world; that Jehovah the Almighty God of righteousness will shortly destroy the power of the evil god, and will establish on earth a righteous government that will relieve the people of their burdens and bring them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ever</span><span class="font5">lasting blessings; that we are now at a crisis and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">issue before the people is the greatest of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who is the invisible ruler of the nations of earth? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font5">it Jehovah or another? Jehovah is the true God. Of him Jesus declared that to know God means life everlasting. He is the great Eternal One, the Creator of heaven and earth, the Giver of every good and perfect gift. (Isa. 42:5) When Israel was his chosen people Jehovah was his national name to them. His name means more than that. It signifies his purpose toward his creation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">Word, the Bible, discloses his purpose; hence the Bible is the authority for this conclusion. He is just and righteous. His “judgments are true and righteous altogether”. (Ps. 19:9) “For Jehovah is righteous; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">loveth righteousness.” (Ps. 11: 7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font5"> U.) His righteousness is likened unto the stedfastness of the great mountains, and his justice as deeper than the bottomless sea. —Ps. 36 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is so wise that he can never make a mistake. The wisdom of the wisest men of the world is foolishness when compared with the wisdom of Jehovah God. (1 Cor. 1:25) Concerning his creation his prophet wrote: “0 Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all.” (Ps. 104: 24) In wisdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">created man, and his wisdom prepared the great </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">plan </span><span class="font5">for teaching man by experience and the granting to the obedient ones everlasting blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">Jehovah resides all original power. All others exercising power do so by the permission of Jehovah. All the power of all the nations of earth is but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">drop of a bucket or the small dust in the balance when compared with the power of Jehovah God. (Isa. 40:17-22) He is the Almighty God, which means there is no limitation to his power. (Gen. 17:1-6) For him to will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">thing to be done means that it shall be done. When he willed to create the earth and the things thereof his spirit moved upon the elements, and the earth and living creatures thereon resulted. (Gen. 1:1-26) His spirit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">his power, invisible to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is love, which means that everything he has ever done or ever will do is prompted by unselfishness. He is self-contained and needs nothing, and none can bring him any benefit. All his acts are performed for the benefit of his creatures. His prophet, who had learned of him, exclaimed: “How excellent is thy lov-ingkindness, 0 God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.’’ (Ps. 36:7) “Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.”—Ps. 63: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am not unmindful of the fact that Jehovah has repeatedly been charged as unjust and cruel. But when we learn that his enemy has made the charges and instilled them into the mind of man we know that the charges are false. (John 8:44) In Jehovah dwell justice, wisdom, power and love, all working together in exact harmony and always exercised for the good of his creation. For this reason it is written: “Blessed is that nation whose God is Jehovah.” The converse of that statement must be true; therefore no nation could have a real blessing unless that nation has Jehovah for its God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ABSENCE OF BLESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be blessed a nation must have peace, be free from oppression and the fear thereof; the people must be secure in their property, in their homes, and in their bodies; the laws of that nation must be administered equally for the general welfare of all, with special privileges to none; and the people must enjoy prosperity in their material and in their spiritual affairs. Is there a man on earth today who can within his memory point to a nation that has had a real blessing? I am certain there is none. There is a reason for this. I wish to emphasize that my purpose is not to bring reproach upon any people. I desire now to state the facts as they exist, to the end that we may honestly and fairly determine who is, and for a long time has been, the god or invisible ruler of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How may we determine who has been the invisible ruler of man during a fixed period of time? The rule laid down by Jesus is a safe one to follow, to wit: “By their fruits ye shall know them.” If a nation or government practises injustice, shows undue favor to a few and greatly oppresses the majority, surely no honest man could say that that nation is just. If the visible power is exercised by a few to the detriment of the majority, that course shows a great lack of wisdom and the absence of love. Looking back over the history of the nations of earth during the past twenty-five hundred years it will be readily conceded that in that time there has been gross injustice practised upon and great oppression put upon the peoples that have been ruled. In that period of time no ruler has left an ideal record behind. Is that unhappy condition and the result due to the fact that all rulers are willingly unjust? I am sure that is not the reason. On the contrary, facts show that many rulers have diligently tried to establish a just and wise government; and after laborious efforts have signally failed. Many rulers have laid down their lives in a vigorous endeavor to better the people and they have not succeeded. Their honesty could not be called in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then why have they failed? True there have been officials who have been willingly dishonest, cruel and oppressive, but even the worst of these have yielded to a sinister influence which has induced them to lead a wrongful course. That evil and powerful influence has been exercised by the invisible ruler over the visible rulers. Why has this been so? God’s Word discloses the true answer, to wit, that the invisible ruler over the nations has been and is that great evil one, Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIL GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When man walked in Eden, the garden of Jehovah, he was perfect in his organism. Jehovah delegated to his son Lucifer the power and authority to be man's invisible overlord. Lucifer was then perfect and a creature of glory. Lucifer and the Logos were the two “Morning Stars” that together sang an anthem of praise at the laying of the foundation of the earth. (Ezek. 28:14-17; Job 38:7) It was the nature of man to worship Jehovah God. Lucifer desired such worship for himself. His ambition led him to rebellion against God, which activity began by Lucifer’s inducing man to disobey God’s law. (Isa. 14:11-14) That wrongful act has worked great havoc to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result man was sentenced to death and expelled from his paradise home, and all mankind have since suffered from the effects thereof. (Gen. 3:3-24; Rom. 5:12) That evil effect upon the nations is thus expressed by the prophet: “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning 1 how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!” —Isa. 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ceasing to be an angel of light Lucifer became the very embodiment of darkness and wickedness, and from then till now the Bible designates him under the titles Satan, Serpent, Dragon and Devil. All the unrighteous wars that have been fought between men, and all the cruel murders committed by men, have been due to the wicked influence of Satan the Devil because he was the first murderer and the father of lies. (John 8: 44) All the tears of bitterness that have flowed from those who have been dealt with unjustly and sorely oppressed must be traced to the influence of Satan because he is the great and wicked oppressor. (Ps. 72:4) All the bitterness that has existed and been exhibited between professed Christian people, all the religious intolerance and persecution of Christians, must be laid at Satan’s door. All the foul aspersions against Jehovah God and all defamation of his holy name must be laid to the charge of Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today in every nation there arises a cry of the people against unrighteousness. 1 hold that the primary unrighteousness manifested by the governments can not be laid to the charge of men who hold the offices. There is an unseen power that induces unrighteousness and oppression; and that power is exercised by Satan the Devil, who is the god or invisible ruler of this world. Nineteen hundred years ago the perfect man Jesus was on earth. He came into the earth to represent his Father Jehovah God and to do his Father’s will. (John 5: 30) For three and one-half years Jesus suffered the most cruel persecution that could be inflicted and which culminated in his ignominious death. For a time the common people heard him gladly and hailed him as their Savior. Then the Pharisees and rulers incited the people against him, and they all turned against him, and the Roman government yielded to their cries for his blood and they crucified him. Were the Pharisees and the rulers wholly to blame for his death? They were parties to the wrongful act of killing him, but the Apostle Peter, under inspiration, said to them, as recorded in Acts 3:17: “And now, brethren, I wot [know] that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who is the responsible one and who really prevented the visible rulers and Pharisees from knowing and understanding the truth? Jesus answered that Satan the Devil was the one, because they were yielding to his influence and doing his will. (Matt. 23:14-16; John 8:42-44) Furthermore, it is plainly written, in 2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4, that Satan the Devil is the god of this world and that he blinds the minds of men lest the truth should shine into their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was Satan the Devil who sought to induce Jesus to violate his covenant with Jehovah and thereby bring about Jesus’ own destruction. Failing in this he did not cease his activities against Jesus. “When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him [Jesus] for a little season.”—Luke 4:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time the Jews sought to kill Jesus, and in every instance they were acting under the influence of Satan the Devil. As Jesus neared the end of his earthly pilgrimage he said to his disciples: “Hereafter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.” (John 14: 30) Shortly thereafter Judas betrayed Jesus into the hands of those who killed him; and, as to the responsible one who induced Judas thus to do, it is written: “And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.” (Luke 22:2, 3) “And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.”—John 13 : 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The proof is therefore conclusive that it was Satan, the invisible ruler of this world, who caused the death of Jesus. Such wicked persecution could not have proceeded from Jehovah God against his own Son. From then till now true Christians have suffered violent persecution. Nearly all the apostles of Jesus suffered violent deaths. Was Jehovah God responsible therefor? Certainly not. Jesus Christ is the anointed Son of God; and the church are the body members of Christ, and each one is therefore a son of God.—Rom. 8:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Afterwards the Romans persecuted and put to death many Christian people. The French government did the same thing. Many avowed Christians were burned at the stake in the British Empire. John Calvin, the great preacher, when he held a high position in the government of Switzerland, caused Servetus to be burned at the stake. In the Turkish government thousands of people were put to a cruel death because they claimed to be Christians. During the World War Christian people were persecuted, imprisoned and killed in nearly every nation engaged in the war because those Christian people would not violate their conscience and God’s law by killing their fellow man. Shall these terrible deeds of blood be charged wholly to men ? I answer, No. The wicked influence of the invisible ruler Satan induced the commission of such great crime. Such wrongs could not have proceeded from Jehovah God, because he is just and loving and because that persecution was leveled chiefly against his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the evidence shows that Satan, the invisible ruler of this world, is the responsible one for such wrongful acts, and the conclusion is in harmony with the words of Jesus, who said to his followers: “Because ... I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. ... If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. In the world ye shall have tribulation.” (John 15:18-21; 16:33) This is further proof that the persecution of Christians has been induced by Satan the Devil and that he is the invisible ruler of this world. The fight of the Christian has not been against men, but against the invisible Satan and his cohorts of evil. Upon this point it is written: “Put on the complete armour of God, so as to be able to stand firm against all the stratagems of the Devil. For ours is not a conflict with mere flesh and blood, but with the despotisms, the empires, the forces that control and govern this-dark world.”—Eph. 6:11, 12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENT-DAY WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the purpose of proving that Satan is the god or invisible ruler of all the nations of earth, and that he is primarily responsible for all the wickedness, crime, oppression and intense suffering of the peoples, I read into the record the testimony of some well-known men of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a long period of time the trade in women for immoral purposes has been carried on in many nations and the governments have licensed such wicked traffic. An effort was made to abolish that evil practice. Concerning the League Committee appointed to investigate and report upon the abolition of this wicked traffic the Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font5"> under date of March 6, 1928, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It proved impossible to obtain a unanimous recommendation for tlie immediate abolition by all governments of tlie system of licensed brothels. Representatives of tlie governments of countries where this system still exists, such as France, Italy, Roumania, Spain, and Japan, opposed the proposal, requesting that further inquiries should be made about the consequences of the abolition to public order and public health. . . . The Belgian delegate was one of the most convincing advocates of abolition, although tlie system of licenses still exists in Belgium. . . . Five years ago, France and other governments objected to any discussion of the subject on tlie ground that it was merely a domestic question. Now the international character of the evil is no longer denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the Roumanian government </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation, </span><span class="font5">in its issue of June 13, 1928, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roumanian Government, in fact, stands for corruption and unconcealed bribery; it stands for pogroms and the violent persecution of the national minorities within the borders of Roumania; it stands for the property rights of prominent members of the Liberal party at the expense of other individuals and of the nation itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Russia the government is deporting Zionists to bleak Siberia, where they suffer indescribable agony. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of June 3, 1928, quotes Dr. Arlosoroff as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Places consisting of three to five houses, situated at a distance of hundreds, sometimes more than a thousand, miles from a railway station, with mail service only three times a year, are selected to form the residence of the deported Zionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ogpu, the Soviet political secret service, provides each of the deportees with only about three dollars a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convicts are prohibited from walking beyond the bounds of the village. Deportees who fail to present themselves for daily registration are considered attempting to escape and are punished by confinement in a penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sick persons suffering from acute attacks of fever are dragged daily to register. In Kirgisia more than forty Zionist deportees have been punished by imprisonment on account of letters found at their homes. Every second month the location of the deportees is changed in order to prevent “adjustment” and acquisition of a suitable occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Italy has abolished her constitution, and her present government is a tyranny. The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span><span class="font5">of June 9, 1928, publishes a communication from Signor Nitti, ex-prime minister of Italy, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all freedom of association, of assembly, of the press suppressed, all the independent papers, even Conservative and Catholic, suppressed, boys and girls are to be brought up from the tenderest years in the cult of violence. . . . Irresponsible children, even young girls, are armed for the defense of the regime. In the streets of Italy children of both sexes are to be seen going through military drill with firearms. They are taught the principles of violence; they hear every day justifications of war; hatred is inspired in their young hearts. They are told that Italy should be an empire, and that in consequence she will have to go to war. . . . Every freedom of professional activity is restricted; the independence of the magistrates is suppressed; special tribunals, no longer composed of magistrates but of party members, judge and condemn their opponents, who have hardly any means of defense, and deport them almost always without having put them under interrogation. To leave Italy without the permission of the government has become impossible. . . . Italy has become a vast prison, where there is no more laughter and no more life, and where an extreme poverty, in spite of false information spread by official agents in every country in Europe and America, is becoming daily more insupportable. Thousands of honorable citizens who can no longer get permission to leave Italy have to undergo every sort' of humiliation: illustrious generals, deputies, professors are thrown into prison or deported to desert islands. Political crime and torture are held in honor as in the worst periods of the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The oppression of the peoples of Egypt and India by the great British Empire is well known to the people of all lands. At home her yeomanry are burdened to the breaking point under the great load of taxation to enable the nation to carry on her imperialism. From all parts of the earth are heard the cries of the people because of unreasonable taxation and other burdens laid upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States is the richest country in natural resources on the earth; yet in this land of plenty millions are without employment and suffer in want for the necessities of life. At the same time the burden of taxation and graft has increased to the breaking point. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font5"> under date of December 17, 1927, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Graft and corruption are the curse of government. Nowhere is their burden heavier than in New York. . . . The average citizen reaches the breaking point when crooked politics and crooked business uniie to double the charge. Scores of property owners in Queens, including home owners, are threatened with having to let their property be sold to meet the exorbitant Queens sewer assessment. Some es i-mates are that half of the entire $10,000,000 cost of tlie Jamaica system is due to graft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gigantic light and power trust has corrupted the primary parts of the government, invaded the schools and colleges, corrupted the teachers, and made a systematic attempt to turn the minds of the youth from, the right principles of government. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font5"> of June 21, 1928, quotes Congressman La Guardia as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The revelations in the Senate, and the investigation by the Federal Trade Commission of the power trust, have disclosed one of the most cruel monopolies ever formed in this country. Electric power is in the hands of an absolute monopoly, and the disclosures would indicate that millions of dollars are available for corruption, control of legislation, and the subsidizing of Instructions in both public and private colleges throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That wicked corporation has not even been rebuked by the visible rulers of the American nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of June 3, 1928, quotes Senator Underwood as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people who exercise the power are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised. Organized minorities now rule. The plain people are not organized. They have no agents at the capital to protect their interests; they are often misinformed and misled by untruthful propaganda. ... A full half of the laws now passed are experimental in their inception and unhappy in their results. . . . The government has become a complicated bureaucracy that every day is becoming more and more oppressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Senator Reed of the United States Senate, from the public platform and in the press, declares that the government of the United States is now in the hands of “boodlers, grafters and lobbyists”. Is Jehovah the God of those wicked men?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Derelictions of every nation on earth might be here mentioned if time would permit. My purpose is not to magnify their shortcomings but to mention enough to show that Jehovah is not the god of these nations but that Satan the Devil is the invisible ruler or god of every nation now on earth. His subtle influence always for evil is responsible for the crimes against the people and the great suffering of the people in every nation. At the same time he has sought diligently to keep the people blind to the real truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What could be the purpose of Satan in leading the people into such deplorable conditions, causing the nations to war against each other and at the same time to call themselves Christian? Satan’s primary objective has ever been to defame the name of Jehovah God and to cause the people to hate and turn away from Jehovah, that he (Satan) might still keep them under his rule and control. He has falsely induced the clergy, his visible representatives, to teach that Jehovah is the god of the nations of earth and at the same time to charge Jehovah with the responsibility for all war and crime. In doing this he has caused millions of honest minds to turn away from the true God and to cast away his Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the World War it is conceded by the leading men of every nation that crime and wickedness has increased; that organized Christianity is losing its influence over the people; and that corruption in high places becomes more marked. Mr. Lloyd George, in an article published Sunday, June 24, 1928, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The young men who passed through the war came to the conclusion that a religion which permitted and seemed to encourage such an outbreak of savagery was an exposed sham. The revolt or, rather, the sulkiness of youth is the most serious problem with which the churches are confronted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why is this unhappy condition enhanced in the last decade? The Scriptures answer: “Woe to the inhabiters </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY PERMITTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If all just power resides in Jehovah God, why has he permitted Satan to exercise power over the nations? Briefly answered, he has permitted it in order that mankind might by experience have a full and complete lesson in the baneful effects of wrong doing. God expelled man from Eden, and set before him good, and permitted Satan to place evil before man, and permitted man to exercise his free moral agency and to follow the Devil, suffer sorrow and death, or to be faithful and obedient to God and learn the way to life everlasting and happiness. To that end Jehovah chose the Israelites and entered into a covenant with them. The very first words of that covenant are that the Israelites should have no other god besides Jehovah and should not bow down and worship other gods. (Exod. 20:2-5) That commandment was not given because of selfishness on Jehovah’s part, but solely for the benefit of man. In other words Jehovah said to them: ‘Satan and his associates will lead you into suffering and death. If you will live, hear my voice and obey me.’ It was like a considerate parent saying to his wayward son: ‘Do not follow that wicked man and lose everything, but obey me if you will be happy.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The charge is often made that Jehovah is a cruel and bloodthirsty God. That charge is wholly false. Bear in mind that Jehovah is the only source of life. He gives and he has the right to take away. By reason of wilful disobedience Adam was justly sentenced to death. By inheritance all men came into existence without the right to life. (Rom. 5:12; Ps. 51:5) Nations under the influence of Satan persisted in persecuting the Israelites as God’s chosen people. They were grossly wicked, justly condemned, and deserved to die. He executed them as a sheriff would legally execute a condemned criminal. When the Israelites persisted in wilfully disobeying God’s law, for their own good Jehovah used other nations as his executioners to punish them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">every instance God’s acts have been legal and just and exercised for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-five hundred years ago God withdrew his favor from Israel because of her disobedience and permitted Babylon to execute his judgment against that nation. At the same time he promised that he would in the future establish a righteous government at the time of the coming of him whose right it is to rule. The faithful ones have been waiting for that due time of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOVERNOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it to be understood from that statement that Jehovah intends to establish a righteous government on earth for the benefit of man? That is exactly what it does mean. Jesus Christ is the beloved Son of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">is the anointed Governor or King of the world and in God’s due time he becomes the invisible Ruler of the world in complete harmony with Jehovah’s will. Where the power of the invisible Satan has been used for evil, the power of the invisible Christ will now be used for good and for the blessing of the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was before Pilate he declared himself to be the Anointed One to rule the world. When he was raised from the dead all power in heaven and earth was committed into his hands. (Matt. 28:18) He did not begin, however, to exercise that power at once. When he ascended into heaven Jehovah said to him, as recorded in Ps. 110:1: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” The World War marked the end of that period of waiting, as shown by the testimony of Jesus himself. (Matt. 24: 3-14) That marked the time when Jehovah through his prophet says: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) And now Jehovah says to Christ, earth’s righteous Governor: “Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them [the powers of evil] with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” —Ps. 2: 8, 9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The beginning of the World War marked the end of Jehovah’s waiting. Satan was then cast out of heaven and has come down to earth, here to carry on his wickedness against which God gives warning. (Rev. 12:12) Jehovah commands that notice now be served upon the nations before he proceeds to destroy Satan’s power; therefore he says to the rulers of earth: “Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve [give allegiance to] the Lord . . . lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”—Ps. 2: 10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the great issue before the nations and peoples of earth, Who is your God and whom will you serve, the Devil or Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God will shortly overthrow the Devil’s established organization and will set up righteousness in the earth. Before he does so he offers the nations of earth an opportunity to voluntarily renounce the Devil, acknowledge Jehovah as the only true God, and Christ as earth’s rightful and righteous Governor. The purpose is now to serve notice upon the nations and peoples that they may take their stand on the side of Jehovah. If they fail so to do, then what shall follow ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMAGEDDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At stated intervals of time Jehovah has forcefully brought his name before the peoples, lest they should forget that he is their only Benefactor and Life-giver. When the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, God went down into Egypt to make for himself a name. (2 Sam. 7:23) He sent Moses and Aaron to serve notice upon the Egyptians. What came to pass there foreshadowed greater things to come to pass and which are now beginning. (1 Cor. 10:11) In serving notice Moses and Aaron represented Christ and his church. Egypt and its ruler represented the Devil and his organization. God there exercised his power to overthrow the Egyptians and their armies. Now the nations of earth failing to take their stand on the side of Jehovah but holding to Satan, God will overthrow Satan and his organization in the great battle of Armageddon and all the nations and tribes of earth shall see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While all the nations will be involved in Armageddon it will not be fought between nations, as the great World War was fought. The Scriptures declare that it will be “the great battle of God Almighty”. (Rev. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16:12-14) </span><span class="font5">The reason for the battle is this: The time has come for God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus, to take over the rulcrship of the world and to rule in righteousness. Satan’s misrule must now end. Arrogant, cruel and wicked beyond description, Satan thinks he can defeat Jehovah and therefore prepares for the great battle </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Armageddon. He musters all of his forces, both visible and invisible. He puts forth all of his endeavors to discredit God, and to turn the people against God, and to induce them to embrace a religion that entirely leaves out God. He blinds the minds of statesmen, leading them to believe that they have the ability to establish </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">desirable government and that they may be aided in so doing by heeding the advice of an apostate and dishonest clergy. He induces the selfish financiers to believe that their power is irresistible and that they can corrupt the rulers and oppress the people at will. Thus the forces </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">evil are arrayed against God and his Anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will no longer permit Satan to exercise his blinding influence over the peoples of the earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">great battle of Armageddon is necessary to teach all creation that Jehovah is the true God and besides him there is none. Some vision of the battle of Armageddon is given in God’s Word. The time comes for action and he says to his beloved Son, his anointed Priest and King: “Thou art fairer than the children </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font5">most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.”—Ps. 45: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore he says to earth’s new Governor: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” As Satan refuses to yield his rule, the battle must follow. Further describing it the prophet says: “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the head [Satan] over many countries.”—Ps. 110: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the far-reaching effect of Armageddon </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font5">prophet Jeremiah says: “A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind [of trouble] shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and- wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”—Jer. 25 : 31-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now notice to the nations is being given by those who are devoted to Jehovah, and this regardless of creed, denomination, or previous condition of servitude. Satan and his agents are making a desperate effort to prevent the giving of such notice. Jesus declares that when this witness work is done Armageddon shall follow, and he describes it as a time of tribulation such as the world has never before known and will never again know.—■ Matt. 24: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a further description the prophet says: “The earth [Satan’s visible organization] shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.”—Isa. 24: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why will Jehovah engage in such a terrible battle? The answer is, Because evil must be eradicated and Satan, who is the god of this world, must cease to further rule over the governments and nations of earth and therefore must be ousted completely and his organization for ever destroyed. Jehovah will make for himself a name, and by this great demonstration of his power will teach the people that he is the Almighty God and that the blessings of life, liberty and happiness come from him and him alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet, further describing Armageddon and what shall follow thereafter, says: “They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.”—Ps. 107: 27-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DESIRE OF THE HONEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The desire of all honest persons, be they republican, democrat or of other political persuasion, is that the people might be prosperous, peaceful and happy; and the desire of all honest kings and rulers throughout the earth is that the people might have a government that would know no war and that the people might enjoy peace, health and life. Such desire could never be realized while Satan the Devil is the god or invisible ruler of man. The battle of Armageddon, now near, and which shall shake the earth from center to circumference, is all-essential to awaken the people to the fact that only Jehovah can satisfy their righteous desire. Therefore God says: “Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens [invisible rule] and the earth [visible rule], and the sea [even the multitudes of earth], and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Hag. 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RIGHTEOUS RULER</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ, who is God’s anointed King, must now become the Ruler of earth. His power and influence is all for good. Under his rule all oppression, graft and crime will cease, and the poor and needy will have their just share and the way of his government will be equal. “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.”—Ps. 72: 4, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government resting upon his shoulder shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font5">government of peace and righteousness. (Isa. 9:6, 7) Seeing the people desire no more war, men are making an attempt to establish peace in earth. They can never succeed. War will not cease until Satan is bound and shorn of his power, and this will be done in the great battle of Armageddon. The act of the binding of Satan is described in Revelation 20: 1-3: “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and .shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the same time God through his prophet says: “The battle bow shall be cut off: and he [God] shall speak peace unto the nations.”—Zech. 9: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the government of Jehovah under Christ in full sway never again shall the people have war. (Isa. 2: 2-4) The righteous rule will bring to the people not only peace but prosperity. Poverty will quickly pass away, the earth will yield her increase, and the Lord will spread a feast </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font5"> all the people. (Isa. 25: 6; Ps. 67:7) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No </span><span class="font5">more shall fraud and deceit be practised upon the people. No more will the people be kept in blind ignorance concerning their just rights; but all shall know the truth, from the least to the greatest of them. (Jer. 31: 31, 34) Yea, more than that, sickness, sorrow and death shall cease and the dead shall return from their graves and be joined again with their loved ones.—John </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5; </span><span class="font5">28, 29; Rev. 21:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">Isaiah </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">25</span><span class="font5">:6-8 it is written that God will make </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">feast of fat things for all the people; that all blindness and misunderstanding shall be taken away; that he will swallow up death in victory and wipe away tears from off all faces. Then they that love God and obey him and yield to the beneficent influence of earth’s righteous invisible Ruler shall live for ever and shall never die. —Ezek. 18: 27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why is it that a few men can organize great corporations, with unlimited wealth and power, and brazenly use them to corrupt the officials of the government and to oppress the people? Why is it that the official government gives special favors to the ultrarich while a deaf ear is turned to the cries of the oppressed? Why does one of those corporations, to wit, the National Broadcasting Company, form an alliance with the clergy and they together attempt to determine what the people shall hear or not hear concerning religion and the Bible? Why is it that the clergy oppose and persecute those who tell the people the truth and at the same time furnish a sanctimonious smoke-screen behind which cruel corporations and conscienceless politicians carry on their nefarious work? I answer, It is because Satan the Devil is their god. They are under his power and influence, and his bidding they will do. Is there no hope of relief for the people?. Yes, and that relief is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s rebellious son, who has long been the invisible ruler of the world, is responsible for all the persecution, oppression and suffering of the peoples of earth. Jehovah’s due time has come when the wicked rule of Satan must end. By and through his anointed and faithful Son, Christ Jesus, Jehovah will, in the great battle of Armageddon, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">destroy</span><span class="font5"> Satan’s organization, and will then establish the world in righteousness, which shall endure for ever.—Ps. 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who then will declare himself wholly on Jehovah’s side ? Let the battle-cry of all those who love him henceforth be: “THE SWORD OF JEHOVAH AND OF HIS ANOINTED.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">am persuaded that there are very few of the peoples of earth who really desire to be evil. Most of the men exercising the power of rulership would prefer to see righteousness in the earth. Both the people and the rulers have been deceived and overreached by Satan the Devil. When the nations and peoples come to know the truth and serve and obey God then it can be truly said: “Blessed is that nation whose God is Jehovah.” The issue is now plain and clear: Will the nations continue to serve the Devil, or will they serve and obey Jehovah God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Declaration is not against the people nor the men in office. It is not against the blind preachers who have misled the people. This Declaration is against the common enemy of all creation. It is against the enemy who for centuries has defamed the name of Jehovah God and brought unbounded sorrow to man. It is agaimt Satan and his allies in darkness and evil. It is made as a testimony to the fact that Satan’s evil rule must shortly end and that Jehovah, for his name’s sake and the salvation of the people, will establish a righteous government that all the nations of earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">appeal to the people of all nations, to all lovers of righteousness, to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. Let every one who desires to see evil eradicated and righteousness for ever established in the earth, and the people blessed with peace, happiness and life, so signify by standing up and voting Aye for this Declaration.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark14"></a>LETTERS FROM AFIELD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE following letter is from a police sergeant at Creighton, Natal, South Africa. It breathes the spirit of the Lord. This brother is laying aside his business to go throughout that land to carry the message of Truth to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am writing to tell you that Brother Phillips has been here, and how much we appreciated his short stay amongst us. We really feel revived and have received renewed courage to go on proclaiming the Good Tidings of the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have spoken to quite a lot of people since the lecture, and every one agrees that it was the best they have ever heard; and even those who were prevented or hindered from coming expressed great regret for having missed it. Our most prominent business man here spoke to me on the matter and said he felt he had missed something good. I have also found interested listeners on my rounds since the lecture, and all seem to feast on the things told them, and I feel it is not overstating the facts if I say that a good many here are hungering after the truth; and from conversations I have had with many they gradually come to see that they are fed on husks by the clergy. The great majority, although afraid to stand out, roundly condemn the church systems. By the Lord’s help I trust to improve my sales considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have also discussed the matter with Brother Phillips anent our taking up full-time colporteuring work; and since his departure I have further thought the matter over and have now decided to commence the colporteuring work as front the beginning of the new year, 1929. I had certain difficulties to overcome, but have decided to leave them all to the Lord and to go forth in his strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I feel that although I have a small family they should not stand in my way to go out and serve. There is certainly the text re providing for your own family, in the sight of all men, and behind which many Bible Students hide, and I feel that the great prize offered by Jehovah, and the magnitude of his work, demands my whole life and all that I can give, and that to continue in an occupation, of whatever kind, means serving the Devil for six days and trying to serve the Lord on the seventh, and then very often one is prevented from doing so, owing to the Sunday laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I would very much like to go out earlier than 1929, but I have to arrange for a conveyance, learn to drive it, and give three months’ notice to leave the police. Please let me know if the rates you have sent me would still hold good then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the meantime I will do all I can to give a faithful witness to this place, knowing that ‘his word will not return to him void but will prosper in that whereunto it is sent’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a wonderful battle we are waging, because it is the Lord's; and I often feel that I am not worthy of so great a privilege as is mine now. My desire and prayer is that throughout the land brethren, who are consecrated, would awaken to their great responsibility and privilege and sing forth the honor of Jehovah at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We pray for the Lord’s continued blessing upon each of you individually, and upon all you perform in the name of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother in the service of our King,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOTOR CARS FOR THE FIELD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has cooperated with the friends in arranging for six motor cars to be assigned to the isolated districts in Canada for the purpose of doing the service work. The brethren in each community take the responsibility of the cost and equipment of the car. The companies travel through the country reaching territory that otherwise could not be worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sample report is given below for the interest of our readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In reply to your letter of June 28, regarding space in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jiltlletin</span><span class="font4"> to be utilized for the house-car work, we are quite sure that this will be both interesting and helpful to all of the Lord’s people who are Interested in the service work. The house-car operating under my jurisdiction has had wonderful success to date, this in spite of exceptionally wet weather. We thought last year that we bad as wet a June as it was possible to have, but this year has been even worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The house-car is operating in the territory east and north of North Battleford, covering territory which has never yet received a really house-to-house witness since the inauguration of the kingdom message in the earth. When one considers the sparsely settled country and the long distances between calls, their success has been most remarkable. I note from the house-car captain’s report that nineteen to twenty-six calls constitute a long day's work, and upon one occasion one hundred and fifty books were placed in a day. This speaks for itself. The workers are very enthusiastic and find the work very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Franske is most enthusiastic regarding the mechanical excellency of his chassis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The few isolated friends they have had the pleasure of meeting have shown a wonderful spirit of cooperation in every possible way, showing that hospitality which is a peculiarity and earmark of the Lord’s people, when done in the interest of his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evening before the van left Saskatoon the friends held a “shower” in its interest, and the van, therefore, left here equipped with almost everything that could be desired to care for the physical comfort of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The workers have found, almost uniformly, that the sale of literature has been greatly increased as a direct result of the Canadian Government’s action in banning our broadcast. Repeatedly they have had the matter brought up, the persons so doing registering strong indignation at the action of the Government, and buying literature, sometimes to prove their active sympathy, other times because they were really interested through what they had heard over the air. We look for this attitude to continue on the part of the people, and will report further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much Christian love, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother in Christ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Geo.</span><span class="font2"> P. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Naish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brother Rutheiu’ohd :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently a motion was passed unanimously by the Kansas City ecclesia that we express by letter our appreciation of the services rendered us by Brother Rainbow. His visit here has been a great help to us, opening our eyes to many things which have assisted us to become more thoughtful and more watchful of our opportunities of service in proclaiming the message of the kingdom and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span class="font4"> privilege of sharing in the declaration of the Lord’s judgment against ecclesiasticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We beiieve any class or individual will receive a great benefit as well as a great blessing by cooperating with Brother Bainbow in the wonderful privileges the Lord has granted the anointed at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He undoubtedly has a clear conception and clear outline of file work placed in his charge, being fully devoted to the Lord’s cause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brotiier :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I feel impelled to write you a few lines in appreciation of your latest book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation. Nothing</span><span class="font4"> could more clearly express the “wisdom of this world” than the illustration on page 101. It shows the folly of assumed wisdom. There is a man with a stack of books trying to explain how that which belongs to the earth formed the earth, or how the earth made the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a relief it must be to get away from the bewildering words and phrases of sucli books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font4"> clear and concise statements found in the book on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation!</span><span class="font4"> It gives me pleasure to show this book, as well as your other books, to the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A BOON TO COLPORTEURS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have just received and read your new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font4"> and hasten to say to you that it is certainly the best and most comprehensive explanation of the divine plan yet written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be the greatest possible boon to the colporteur work, and will bring joy to many hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God bless the hand that prepared it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCENTRATING THE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The suggestion made in the letter to the friends, dated May 31, in regard to service conventions and witness from house to bouse, is something worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I, for one, several years ago often thought about the doing away with the public meetings and getting on the job and witnessing from door </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> door. Truly the above letter is very encouraging to me and I have suggested to the Bloomfield director that he in turn notifj- the nearby classes and get right on the job to inaugurate a system of service conventions once eacii month and combine the effort of witnessing on that day. Nothing could be more up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I want to just mention this as I feel that this could </span><span class="font2">be </span><span class="font4">followed up further by the Society and such programs </span><span class="font2">be </span><span class="font4">continued, to give the greatest witness that is yet to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I personally believe that the time is here when a concentrated effort is made to witness, that Jehovah is much more pleased and that the results are much greater, example of which can be taken from our little convention on April 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord continue to bless you and your efforts </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font4">make mention of his name till the Devil and his organization are ground to powder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in the Master’s service,</span></p>

The approaching termination of her fiscal year finds her Government wearing smiles of satisfaction in the contemplation of its financial achievements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Her revenue for the current year will be approximately $419,000,000. Hence with an expenditure of $365,000,000, she has $54,000,000 snugly tucked away in her pocketbook to meet such exigencies as shall arise. Says the Minister of Finance: “Seldom have annual state</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">energy waits to be geared to the need of man. From fish to timber, Nature has been prodigal in her gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“The mineral belt is 3,000 miles in length and ; produces nearly every known useful metaL Sixty percent of available farm land awaits the ; plow and harrow. Nowhere has an equal number of people (the population is still under the 10,000,000 mark) such enormous undeveloped resources at their disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“The American billions in Canada comprise no idle wealth. On no other alien soil has the</span></p>

The similarity of speech and habit is </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font22">strong that it is sometimes difficult to know where the American phase ends and the Canadian begins. Water power (that ‘white thunder harnessed to the mill’, as a Canadian poet put it) and ample raw material are the lodestones that attract. In the next article you will see in detail the concrete evidence of our activity, from newsprint and pulp to automobiles.</span></p>

On ■ the Welland Canal section of the Waterway the i country is committed to spend $114,000,000. i The United States will derive great benefit i from this.

<p><span class="font22">HE pronounced success of the Winter Carnival at Banff makes it very clear that Canada can be made a Mecca for tourists in winter as well as in summer. Those who by actual experience know nothing of the “treasures of the snow”, toboggans, hillsides crispy with frost, and iridescent ice castles, as well as exhilarating snowshoe tramps, have missed a revelation in what it means to enjoy life. Canadian winter sports, no less than the summer “song my paddle sings”, send the glow of health to the cheek and in a sense bring back the days of youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then the people of Canada are not averse to inside sports as well. Among these they count the movies. On this form of pleasure no less than $30,000,000 was spent last year. This means 5,000 miles of celluloid in moving pictures. And here’s something to think over. The Dominion Parliament has refused to annul its .law against blasphemous libel, under which a certain person was convicted about a year ago. The one who moved the resolution to have the law repealed and his only supporter were formerly clergymen, says the Toronto </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The article says that one of these gentlemen “defends the Sterry article on the ground that what was said therein is being taught every day in the theological colleges of Canada. He says: T could go to almost any theological college of Canada and find professors of Old Testament</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">The rubber industry in Canada has assumed colossal dimensions. As a matter of fact this land is the fourth rubber manufacturing country in the world. The raw material is purchased abroad and the annual Canadian production therefrom amounts in value to $100,000,000. While some make wry faces at this sort of thing, we merely state the facts as they are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">Then the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font22"> says this good thing: “If it is true that the theological chairs of our universities are filled with men who are destroying the foundations of Christianity, it is high time that the laity of every church awoke to the fact and demanded a housecleaning of the institutions their money goes to support. The layman should be cognizant of the fact before it is too late. The time for the hush-hush policy is gone.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">Some drugs in the materia medica are even more foreign to the nature of the body than are the inorganic salts.

<p><span class="font22">intelligent persons, who are not health “cranks” or religious “cranks” or any other type of fanatic, but simple and straightforward Bible students who desire to please their Lord by word and deed and to properly care for the bodies His wisdom has created for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The writer’s purpose in presenting this matter is to give serious warning against the use, in any form, of the drug aspirin. No person who truly loves the Lord and who diligently tries to keep His commandments, and especially no Bible student, would knowingly take morphine, heroin, cocaine, eucain, hasheesh, tobacco, or any other lethal drug. But many of the Lord’s dear ones who read this will be astounded to learn that in taking aspirin to assuage pain, they are becoming slaves to an insidious poison; a drug with deadly properties; a habit-forming, will-destroying, demoralizing narcotic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">There are two forms of chemical compounds, organic and inorganic, or mineral. Organic compounds are those found in nature: in plants, sea-water, air, and in the blood, bones, fluids, and tissues of animals. Inorganic compounds comprise all the metals, stones, minerals, and other substances that are not found in living organisms. Some elements exist in both forms, and a few of those familiar ones which may be either organic or inorganic are iron, phosphorus, sulphur, calcium, silicon, magnesium, and their salts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">These elements and their salts, consisting of the various phosphates, sulphates, oxides, and silicates, are present in the human body, in both simple and highly complex forms, but they are all in the organic state. Fruits, vegetables, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font22">meats contain the above listed substances </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">organic</span><span class="font22"> form, which is readily assimilated by </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font22">normal body. In therapeutics the salts </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">admin</span><span class="font22">istered, though having the same names as those</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font22">ing tissue and never found in the human body in its normal healthy condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Some of the things </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font22"> present in the body are gold, silver, diamonds, lead, tin, zinc, and copper. “Why,” you exclaim, “every one knows that!” Yes, but does every one know that </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">coal tar</span><span class="font22"> is not found, even in blue blood? And yet in cheap candy, highly-colored icings, syrups, flavorings, and </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aspirin,</span><span class="font22"> we find the very same substances, rearranged over and over again by expert chemists, but all derived from the evil source, </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">coal tar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">No one can doubt the </span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font22">ense value of coal tar by-products in all other fields of human activity, such as dye stuffs and explosives; but no one knowing the facts can venture to assert that coal tar products, no matter how nearly they taste, smell, or feel like nature’s products, are fit for human consumption. Still less can any reasonable person fail to doubt the advisability of administering a coal tar by-product into the human body for medicinal purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Aspirin is the trade name for mono-acetie-acidester of salicylic acid. This simply means that it is a derivative, through the agency </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">acetyl, of salicylic acid. Acetyl is a hypothetical monatomic form of acetic acid, the fundamental ingredient of fermented vinegar. Acetyl may be made synthetically from </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">coal tax. </span><span class="font22">Salicylic acid is </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font22">form of salicin, a </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">poisonous </span><span class="font22">compound contained in the bark of willow trees. It may also be made synthetically from coal </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">tar. </span><span class="font22">Aspirin is the result of the treatment of one </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">these synthetic compounds with another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">The statement may be heard in defense of aspirin that each of its constituents is found ia nature, in organic form, and hence the product ought to be of use to the body. Such a hypothesis is entirely wrong, because even among </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">or</span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">ganic compounds, which occur in trees, roota^ or other vegetable life, there are virulent poi-</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">Common sense will warn most people against believing the claims of those whose business it is to advertise quack doctors and their nostrums. There is but one inference to be de</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">bago and dyspepsia, or headache and rheumatism, or acute indigestion and a cold in the head, or any or all of these things put together, must be a dope and can not possibly be anything</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">An </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">honest</span><span class="font22"> physician (and there are many such) will advise against the use of aspirin. The stuff has had tremendous sale because thousands of unscrupulous practitioners have endorsed its use and prescribed it for their patients. Any doctor who can do nothing but </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">relieve pain</span><span class="font22"> is an unintelligent doctor. The physician who has made a careful study of food and its relation to health, and who gives his patients few medicines and plenty of good wholesome advice, is the man to trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The treatment of disease through alleviation of the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">symptoms</span><span class="font22"> is illogical, irrational, and archaic. What sane person would attempt to put out a fire by blowing the smoke away? Symptoms are nature’s warnings of trouble in the human machinery?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The proper course to follow is to obtain from the very best sources available a correct diagnosis of the ailment and then start immediately upon corrective measures, whether dietary or surgical, osteopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, allopathic or homeopathic. When the symptoms lessen and disappear during treatment one may be certain the particular ailment in question has been cured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The deadening effect of narcotics upon pain has never arrested, and never will arrest, the progress of any disease, serious or otherwise. The </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cause</span><span class="font22"> of the pain is there, and is gaining its hold upon the body while the unfortunate victim of delusion thinks he or she has been “cured” by Dr. Blanks’ Elixir or Ambrosia or “Special Prescription” or other hoax.

<p><span class="font22">Taking aspirin for a cold is worse folly than employing it to deaden a headache. A cold always indicates a state of congestion, and then, if ever, the body needs to be thoroughly awakened and roused to a state of throw off the toxins producing the cold. This may be surely done by a two-day fast on orange juice and lots of water. The writer has proved the truth of this in his own person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If any apparent benefit is ever experienced from the use of aspirin for a cold, the reason for it is obviously and undoubtedly this: By the introduction of aspirin the body is forced to make an effort to rid itself of the poisonous drug and in doing so automatically ejects with it most of the cold-producing toxins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But let all intelligent readers mark this: The drug is not so easily got rid of. It (or most of it) stays in the body, lurking in glands or in the blood stream, producing almost continual enervation, uneasiness, and a vague longing for “something” which is appeased only when an additional dose of the drug is administered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Little by little, grain by grain, the victim accumulates within his or her blood stream a sufficient quantity of this pretty, white, granular, coal tar derivative, and then the heart can stand the oppression no longer, and lies down to rest until the day when all who sleep are awakened and given a chance to use their brains in taking care of themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Let us give thanks unto the Lord, that the way of everlasting life, health and happiness is becoming brighter day by day, and that those who love Him are being permitted to learn of the proper way to care for their bodies through the means of the wonderful foods He has provided for them. Let us endeavor so to employ nature’s means of keeping well that we </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font22">always be in fit condition to carry abroad the message of the King and kingdom, to the everlasting praise and glory of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">I know that the doctors dose the people with ’ medicines which they do not believe in themselves. I know that doctors’ families use very few drugs. I know that you can scarcely find an intelligent physician today that will not admit this to his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that they have specifics to prevent one from taking almost any disease, yet not one of them can tell you how the prevention is brought : about. I know they would vaccinate people for smallpox and that there is not a doctor that can explain how it prevents smallpox nor can he , prove that it does prevent it. They are not content to vaccinate people who come to them but they ask the state to pass laws to compel every- i body to be vaccinated. I might as well ask the | state to pass a law to compel the people to hire me to try their cases!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Sometime, if they keep on—and they will keep on if the people give them a chance—they will be able to vaccinate you for everything and you will be obliged to be vaccinated. I know you can pick out about five or six diseases which cause the deaths of probably nineteen-twentieths of all the people who live and die, and I have no doubt that the doctors will be able sooner or later to find a serum that will prevent you from getting any of them—but you will probably die in the operation I If we could pick out the various things that could be injected into the human system for twenty different diseases, I would like to see how a man would look and how long he would last if he took them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Nobody who believes in it need have any fear of smallpox; so why compel people to take it who do not want it? I have watched this medical profession for a long time—and it bears watching—and I know there is not a single thing affecting human life that they will not lay their hands on if we give them a chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">And there is, I think, only one way to beat</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font29">I</span><span class="font22"> HAVE been interested for a good many years in the question of leaving man free to do as he pleases so long as he does not directly interfere with some one else. I am not a chiropractor—</span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font22"> know very little about it—and it is not as a disciple of Dr. Palmer that I say a few words, but as a man who believes in liberty— or did when we had it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I was born into this world without being consulted and I presume there was a doctor present. I did not hire him. As I had no chance to say anything about the way I was born and who was present, I think I should have the right to die without the assistance of a doctor, if I wish. I can not avoid the undertaker but I ought to be able to avoid the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Now, I would have no quarrel with the medical profession if they would leave me alone. I am willing that they should advertise their wares and their business, but I do object to being forced to patronize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that the doctors, like every one else, take themselves very seriously. I know that the A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">efforts of the medical profession in the United States to control the treatment of human ailments is not due to its love of human life: it is due to its love of its job, which job it proposes to monopolize for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that the doctors have been carrying on a vigorous campaign all over the United States against new methods and schools because they want the business and they insist that nobody shall have the right to live or die without their services. Whether they cure more or fewer people than the new schools who do not use medicine, or whether they cure anybody, is, of course, a debatable question, which I will not undertake to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I stand for the right of everybody to regulate his own life for himself, and if he wants to live and die without the aid of the medical profession, he should have the right to do it, and if one should not have that right it is pretty hard to tell what right he should have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that much of the progress of the medical profession, if we can call it that, has been made against the advice of doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that the medical profession is full of humbug and pretense; I know that a considerable percentage of physicians believe that by the aid of a saw and a knife they can make man</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">them, and that is to go to jail if necessary and</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">। defy them. The only part of the community f that has nothing to say about the laws that ; these special interests pass is, the people. All they have to do is pay for it—and they pay aplenty. I do not know how long the people will stand for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">We will have and now have people telling us what we may eat and what we may drink, especially what we may not drink, and we will have the Billy Bryans and the Billy Sundays sending us to jail to save us from going to Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Let me say this: that if the people are willing will be on the books for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">As a matter of fact, no law of any importance was ever taken off the books so long as the great mass of the people obeyed it. Most of the old witchcraft laws of New England are on the statute books today, but they have stopped condemning old women for witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">No law is ever repealed until the people stop obeying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Sometime if men are active enough and brave enough, they will be able to repeal many of the laws that hamper human rights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Something About Railroads </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By a Railroad Man</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">HE spirit of devilish selfishness permeates the very foundation principles of the railroad business. Many high railroad officials agree with this thought and are also of the opinion that this spirit of selfishness has outlived its usefulness in this modern day when the spirit of justice fills the very atmosphere. I personally know high railroad officials who</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">are idealists and who desire to do good to all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">As to statistics, the railroads make public nothing that would be useful to their competitors, and the bookkeeping is a farce and a fraud. Let me illustrate the matter by a figure of speech which all should be able to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Suppose the average man could keep books like the railroads and then have recourse to the government if bankrupt! It would be the millennium sure enough. At present the majority of wage-earners are receiving less than the government’s own figures of the amount necessary to support a family. Kight off they could claim that they are bankrupt and in line for government aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But suppose a man received in wages twice the government’s standard amount His first</span></p><img src="g_E_19280502_files/g_E_19280502-18.png" alt="" style="width:980pt;height:1110pt;">
<p><span class="font22">act in bookkeeping would be to deduct the sum necessary for existence, using the government’s figures. Then if an auto were purchased and expected to run five years, he would figure to lay aside each year twenty percent of the cost of the machine so that a new machine could be purchased when the old one wore out.</span></p><img src="g_E_19280502_files/g_E_19280502-19.png" alt="" style="width:860pt;height:1492pt;">

<p><span class="font22">He would then charge oft a nice amount for possible losses, such as expenses of illness; charge off some more for other unexpected loses; charge off some more for interest; for, if he were like a corporation he would be always in debt, even though well able to get out at any time; and then he would charge some</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">VESTION:</span><span class="font22"> Did Jesus ever say that He was God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font22"> No. There is no scripture in the Bible to that effect. There is only one Supreme Being in the universe who is God, and that is Jehovah. Jesus is not God, but the Son of God. In Colossians 1: 3 we read, “We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” In 1 Corinthians 8:6 we read, “To us there is but one God, the Father, . . . and one Lord Jesus Christ.” In Isaiah 42:8 we read, “I am the Lord [Yah-weh]; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another.” Those who claim that Jesus is God had better study their Bibles and wake up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font22"> What is consecration? I understand that I must make a consecration before I can become a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font22"> Consecration is an unconditional de</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">termination in one’s mind and heart to do God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">will as expressed in the Bible. Jesus said, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 7: 21) In order to do the will of the heavenly Father the individual must have a knowledge of what that will is, and this is expressed in the Bible, which alone is the infallible Word of Truth. We see therefore that in</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">order to be a Christian one must study the Bible</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280502_files/g_E_19280502-26.png" alt="" style="width:137pt;height:150pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">and apply in his conduct the principles therein ^ stated. This process of conforming to the truth i</span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">fs</span><span class="font22"> the process of sanctification. As one walks in ord with the truth, he is fitted for service in GolPsorganization. In praying to the heavenly Fafhudgfor His disciples, Jesus said, “Sanctify</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) A person continues to be the disciple and follower of Christ by keeping the Word of Truth; and the Lord promises to such freedom from error, and grace to do His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">To them that believed on Him, Jesus said: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” — John 8:31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font22"> I am about to make a consecration to do God’s will; but I find myself to be unworthy, and I do not believe that I myself could make my calling and election sure. I recognize that you Bible Students have the truth. What would you do in my case?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font22"> It is a wise step to make a complete consecration to do God’s holy will. God does not expect you, in your own strength, to make your calling and election sure. God will help you, but He expects you to be willing and to cooperate with Him. In Psalm 37:39, 40 we read, “The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble. And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the &quot;wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.” Time and again &quot;when an individual wishes to consecrate, Satan the Devil tries to discourage this determination on the part of the individual; the Devil puts many doubts and excuses into the mind of the individual. Let us remember that Satan is the enemy of God, and Satan opposes any determination to serve God. Let us remember, however, that God is able to help us in every difficulty if we are willing to be helped and come to Him for succor. Each one who will be an overcomer must depend upon the help of Jehovah. An honest man will let nothing in the universe prevent him from serving God. With boundless joy, with whole-hearted determination, and with burning enthusiasm, such an individual will serve the Lord for ever!</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">LL persons like to be prosperous. Every sane man desires to better his own condition and that of his family. He realizes that it is his duty to gather such information as will be helpful to him and to his loved ones. When persons meet, a conversation follows; and it is most natural for them to discuss the times and </span><span class="font11">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">the business conditions and to exchange ideas as to future prospects. Some men study conditions more closely than do others; and the advice of such is heard with interest. If one giving advice is known to be honest and fearless, his words often bring comfort and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">It was on a Sunday morning early in October. The sun was shining brightly, and the soft breezes blew from the south. Two men strolling through the public park met, and to pass away the time seated themselves on a convenient bench and engaged in conversation. Later, a third man walked that way, and was invited to express his views. What followed is of absorbing interest to all who keep abreast with the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> If everything were as bright as this Sunday morning, and as beautiful </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font22">this park, this would be a fine world to live in, wouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> How true is your statement!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> How is business with you? What is the prospect as it appears to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> Not so good as I would like it. I note some of the papers are stressing prosperity, and telling the people how well they are getting on and why they should be so fully satisfied with the present conditions. It is difficult for many of us to see it that way. I can not help but doubt the sincerity of those who speak in this vein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> That reminds me. I attended a very interesting meeting the other evening. There was a big crowd present and some enthusiasm. Speeches were made by very prominent men. The speeches were quite interesting to me. Would you like for me to tell you about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> Please do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> Well, the first speech was made by the president of one of the great corporations; and the substance of it was this: “The</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">499</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22">prosperity of the people depends largely upon the corporations of the land. It is true that these corporations have amassed great material wealth, but this wealth is used for the benefit of the people. We have builded great trunk lines of railroads, steaihship lines, electric power lines, erected great power plants for public service, builded airships and made traveling luxurious. We have furnished the money that has builded our great factories of the country. Our wealth has reclaimed the deserts and made them blossom with vegetation. We have builded up a great commercial system. Our money has builded telephone and telegraph systems; and now we have a great radio system which is to come more fully under the control of the corporations. We support the colleges and universities, build hospitals and churches, and uphold the Christian ministers of the land. We have builded battleships and submarines; and in time of war we furnish the material for defensive and offensive operations. It is true we make great profits, and we are entitled to them. The earth is ours, and we make the world a fit place to live in. The people now have automobiles, comfortable homes and many other luxuries, due to our enterprise and our wealth. The world is getting better, and we have made it so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Don’t you think that sounds pretty good? You know I am working for a corporation; and when a fellow has a great corporation back of him, he feels as if he can do something. Well, I must tell you about the next speech. That was made by a big man they call a statesman or politician. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“My friend who has just preceded me has told you of the power of wealth, and of the great good it has done for the people. He has spoken well. You will observe that when election time comes around, the corporations are always called on to furnish the money, and are on the right side and see to it that men are elected who look after the best interests of the country. We are working together for the good of the people. Look at what good we have accomplished in the country. In 1917, when we were threatened with invasion by a foreign foe, we quickly drafted and passed war measures, and without delay put into the field a great;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">I,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">army which covered itself with glory. We have made the laws and enforced them. We possess the qualifications to govern the people, and the people want us to govern them. We know what the people want, and we see that they get it. The power wielded by the concentrated wealth of the corporations, and the wisdom displayed by our statesmen, are safeguards of the great commonwealth. The clergymen have joined us; and we find ourselves a Christian nation making the world a fit place to live in. The people are made secure in their property, life and liberty and have every reason to be satisfied and content. The earth is for man, and man for the earth. The people are patriotically supporting our institutions, while we look well to their interests. Of course there is some more improvement -which might be made; but with a freer hand to operate in the building of great navies and aircraft and preparation for war we will make the country secure, and under our rulership the world will be entirely safe for democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Don’t you think that was a remarkable speech? You can not beat our corporations and our statesmen. What do you think about it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> Well, go on and tell me what the other man said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> He was a preacher, one of the regular doctors of divinity. I tell you he was an eloquent man, too. He stuck out his chest, and made the hall ring. He began his speech by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“As you know, I am a Christian; and I rejoice to be associated with my Christian friends who have just preceded me upon this platform. I am glad to welcome them into our Christian fold. They are really the principal ones of our flocks. The time was when our Christian organizations were not so popular; but now I am pleased to say that the strong and mighty men of the land have been brought into our midst, and we lean upon them. We are standing shoulder to shoulder for the great good of humanity. What we need today is more men of red blood like these men. In times of war they look after our general welfare, and in times of peace they</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">take the country prosperous. One of the great factors in making the nation strong is the church. Today no great political party can go forward without the church. It w<sup>r</sup>as freely admitted that the World War could not have been won without the ministers. No great financial scheme can be successfully prosecuted without the spiritual advice and comfort given by the clergy. In times past we Christians fought about our creedal differences, but now we are united in a great federation, and I beg to remind you that the man who took the lead in forming the Federation of Churches was one of the greatest financiers America ever produced. Today his distinguished son towers head and shoulders among the great financiers. He likewise is a supporter of the Federation of Churches. Once we differed about the Bible; but now we are united for one purpose; and we welcome to our fold all men, regardless of their views concerning the Bible. Today the Christian church, the power of wealth, and the statesmen of the world should stand shoulder to shoulder. In fact, we are one; and our combined power and influence are destined to bring peace on earth and good will toward men, even if we have to fight for it to the bitter end. Soon we will have robed this earth in God’s glory by the moral achievements of men. Then we can expect Christ to come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Now, don’t you think, Mr. Adversity, that was a powerful speech? What would we do without these corporations and our statesmen and the churches ? The church bells are beginning to ring, and within half an hour services will begin, and I am wondering if I had not better go over there and join that church on the other side of the park I like to be in with the influential ones. But tell me, first, what do you think about those speeches?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> If words mean anything, those speeches would be wonderful. But there is something about them that doesn’t just gibe with real sincerity and honesty. May I tell you a little of my experience and observation? Ten years ago I was operating a grocery business over there at that corner store. I was selling on a small margin, but making a reasonable profit and a living for my family. Corporations began to establish chain stores in the neighborhood. These stores undersold me until I was forced to the wall and had to go into voluntary bankruptcy. Other stores in this city have shared the same fate. Now these chain stores control the business, and the prices of food stuffs have gone up, and the people have to pay the price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then, again, I bought a house, that I might have a home for my family. The officials kept raising the taxes until I could no longer afford to meet my taxes and keep up my payments;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">and I was compelled to give up the house. I lost it. Now I am renting where I can. You will observe that the corporations now own ] of the houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">When the great war came, my friend Wilson was in the furniture business near me. His son, just past twenty-one, a bright young fellow, was in partnership with his father. The conscription military law was passed by the politicians, or statesmen, as they call them; and this young man was forced to gd to war, and his father was forced to buy bonds and war stamps. The young man was killed in action in France. The father’s business went down. He was greatly distressed from loss of his son, and soon died in great sorrow. His widow is now having a difficult time to get on. I well remember being at the church over there you speak of, and Wilson’s son attended it. It was just the week when war was declared. I heard the preacher make a very impassioned speech urging the young men to go to war and to kill. I thought the churches were for the purpose of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. I had great difficulty in harmonizing that preacher’s statements with what I know about the Bible. During the war that preacher and many others were making speeches in their churches, urging the people into the war; and their pet phrase was: “The war will make the world safe for democracy.” I have not seen any real democracy since the war, have you? There is a great deal more of dishonesty amongst the officials than ever before. The papers are full of political scandals. The people have practically nothing to say as to who shall fill the offices, because the corporate interests control politics. You will note that the goods that are manufactured today are shoddy and faulty. The buildings are put up dishonestly. In fact, the world has been made much worse by the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I know that the people have automobiles and other conveniences; but they have been induced to buy them on time payments, and a great many fail to meet the payments, and they lose what they have purchased. It is true that a few men are prosperous and powerful; but are the people generally keeping abreast with the prog* ress of the favored interests ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Craving:</span><span class="font22"> I must admit that all you have said is true. I note that the newspapers aare boasting of great prosperity. If what those </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">men</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">stated at the meeting is not true, I wonder why the press does not expose them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Adversity:</span><span class="font22"> It is difficult to understand* There must be a good reason. But I can not explain it to you. There comes a gen fl e</span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">m an </span><span class="font22">walking this way that I know. His name is Success. That is a good name, isn’t it? He seems to be very prosperous; and look how smiling and apparently happy he is. I know him to be a deep student and have talked to </span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font22">a little along these lines. I am going to call him and ask him to sit down here and give his views on these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Mr. Success was informed concerning what had passed between Craving and Adversity, and was asked to express his views on present conditions and the prospects for prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Success:</span><span class="font22"> Gentlemen, I have given much consideration to the questions you are discussing. I feel sure that I have the truth concerning the cause of the present conditions and understand how prosperity is coming to all the people. To explain to you what I have in mind would require some time, and probably you would not care to listen to me at length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Both Mr. Craving and Mr. Adversity insisted that they would be glad to listen in patience, and urged Mr. Success to speak on. This he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mr. Success:</span><span class="font22"> At the outset I must say that I am a Christian. By that I mean that I believe and accept Jesus Christ as the Savior of mankind. I believe that Jehovah is the only true God, that Christ Jesus is His beloved Son, and that the Bible is God’s Word of Truth, and that from it alone can we be properly instructed. If a man claims to be a Christian, and poses before the people as a Christian, then he should not object to being judged by the Bible. He should be willing to accept the Bible statements as true. If, on the other hand, he poses as a Christian and then denies the Bible and denies God and</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Jesus as the Savior of the world, then we must all agree that he is a hypocrite. If he is a hypocrite, then he is dishonest. If he is dishonesty his words count for nothing, because you could not rely upon them.</span></p>

I have been quite interested in listening to the substance of the speeches made by the gentlemen mentioned by Mr. Craving. If you care to hear it, I shall be pleased to submit some proof to show you why the corporations, the politicians and the preachers are standing together. From this evidence you may be able to see whether their schemes are honest and in the interest of the people or to the contrary. Following that, then, I would</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">like to submit to you some indisputable evidence showing that there is a way by which all the people will have a full and fair show for liberty and prosperity.

<h3><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>The Clergy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">I</span><span class="font22">N THE first place, the clergymen are not Christians. A Christian is one who believes that God through Christ has provided salvation for mankind. The clergymen as a general rule do not believe that. They pose before the people as preachers, and yet they are diligent in keeping the people away from the Bible. Daily they are becoming bolder in denying the Bible; and instead of referring the people to the remedy God has provided, they are telling the people that big business and the politicians and themselves are their guardians and saviors. The majority of these clergymen call themselves Modernists. That means that they deny the Bible account of creation, and the fall of man, and the redemption through Christ Jesus’ sacrifice. The scheme is to turn the minds of the people away from the Bible and away from God, and turn them to the worship of men or other creatures. Why is this true? you may ask. Briefly the reason is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">God created the first man perfect and placed him in Eden, the garden of the Lord. God made Lucifer, one of his great angelic beings, overseer or overlord of man. Lucifer was ambitious to have men worship him; and to accomplish his purposes he induced man to violate God’s law. The penalty for that wrongful act was death. God sentenced Adam to death and ex</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">pelled him from Eden. Bead this in the third chapter of Genesis. Because of this wrongful act, all of Adam’s children were begotten in sin and born in iniquity. (Psalm 51:5) Since then, men have been dying, and -would remain, for ever dead unless God in the exercise of His loving-kindness makes provision for man’s redemption and blessing. Long ago God promised to provide redemption. He promised that He would redeem mankind and then establish on earth a government of righteousness for the blessing of all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">At the time Adam was expelled from Eden God changed the name of Lucifer to that of Satan the Devil. Satan means opposer, and ever since then he has been opposing God. Satan has employed numerous schemes to turn the people away from Jehovah. God could have prevented him from so doing; but the Bible shows that it is God’s purpose to let man have a full lesson in the effects of sin and then to show him the privilege of obeying righteousness and receiving great blessings that He has in store for man. God selected Israel to make of them a model nation and to teach them and through them the way leading to life and happiness. That people had their religious services; and the Devil turned the clergymen of Israel away from God, so that when Jesus came these men claimed to represent God but in fact represented the Devil and deceived the people. —John 8:42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">There is a true Christianity, and there is a false so-called Christianity. This organization, so-called Christianity, is also called Christendom. True Christians believe the truth and delight to tell God’s truth to others. False or so-called Christians yield to the influence of Satan, deceive many, and lead the people away from God. I- could cite you numerous instances of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">You will admit that Bishop Gore and Bishop Barnes, two of the most distinguished clergymen of England, are good samples of what the clergymen are doing. In the London </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font22"> of September 19, 1927, appears a speech made by Bishop Gore at Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, London. He denied the credibility of the Bible and said of the writers of the Bible that “they are masters of storytelling”. Here are some of his words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We are nourishing a vain hope if we suppose that the early chapters of Genesis or the stories about Daniel and Enoch are ever going to be accepted as history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">They have none of the characteristics of history a*</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">real science has learned to detect them, and it is no good kicking against facts. We will merely delay </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font20">necessary adjustment of Christianity to the new </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font20">of ideas by going on murmuring, and perplexing the minds of our children, instead of being perfectly frank _b</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">with our own minds and with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette,</span><span class="font22"> of London, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font22">Monday, September 26,1927, reports the speech of the Reverend Dr. Barnes, Bishop of Birmingham. This is what he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Dr. Barnes was preaching to a large congregation, among whom were many of the boys of Westminster School. He, like Bishop Gore last Sunday at Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, took for his subject the views of </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font20">scientists at the British Association meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“In this age of social and moral confusion, of intellectual progress and unrest, the turmoil was </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font20">great that few landmarks seemed safe, and the religious beliefs and traditions of our forefathers were sharply challenged,^ he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Were they to ding to the old faith? He would rather say: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Welcome new discoveries with an open mind and reverence the great men who made them. But let them remember that, behind all the new knowledge, the fundamental issues of life would remain veiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">*Today,” he continued, *there is, among competent men of science, unanimous agreement that m</span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font20"> has sibly a million years ago, from a tangle of apes </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font20">have become for us folklore. But by the men who </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">built </span><span class="font20">up Catholic theology they </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font20">accepted </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">as solid fact </span><span class="font20">tions of the Catholic system, the sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Darwins triumph has destroyed the whole </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">theo</span><span class="font20">logical scheme.

<p><span class="font22">In America the major portion of the clergyt-men hold exactly the same views as expressed by the two bishops above mentioned. Such </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font22">are not safe advisers of the people. They </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font22">the counterpart of the Jewish Pharisees. </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font22">have a form of godliness but </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">deny the power </span><span class="font22">thereof, even as the Apostle Paul </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">said they </span><span class="font22">would.—2 Timothy 3:1-7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiocast from Station WBBR, New York, by W. E. Van AmburghJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">rpms </span><span class="font22">is a beautiful earth on which we live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The evidences of divine care and interest are manifest all about us. God has abundantly provided for the needs, comforts, delight and enjoyment of man and the other earthly creatures. Trees laden with nuts and fruits for food; trees for shade and beauty decorate the hills and valleys; thousands of varieties of flowers, with their delightful fragrance, and with gorgeous and delicate hues to delight the eye; the grains and vegetation of the fields; the clouds to bring moisture and water the land; the minerals, coal and clay in the mines: yea, everything about us speaks in praise of </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">Creator of the earth and the things upon it. Some one has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“There’s a sermon in the flower, There’s a sermon in the tree, But to me the greatest sermon Is the fact that I can see.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Yet amid all these blessings from Jehovah God there is an undercurrent of sadness, which, like the undertow of the tide, drags </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">its victims </span><span class="font22">to death, sooner or later. Why is this? </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Could </span><span class="font22">not the great Jehovah have arranged some plan whereby this sadness might have been avoided 1 In briefer phrase, Why do people die! Could not God have made man to live as long and as happily on earth and be as free from sin and pain as the angels of heaven!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">It has been my privilege to serve at a great many funerals. It is on such occasions that the sadness is more keenly felt and special comfort is needed, something that will sustain the heart that is almost broken and in its greatest need.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Comfort from the Scriptures</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">D</span><span class="font22">OUBTLESS among you who are listening in tonight there are many who are mourning the recent loss of a loved one who was very near and dear to you, and your hearts are wounded and sore, and a heavy cloud hangs over the future and you seem to be left without comfort or hope. May I have the privilege offering to you some of the comfort which our God of love has for those who will accept? Let me tell you the message of love which has comforted thousands who have also passed through the deep waters of sorrow. I feel sure that it will gladden your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If you were in a large city for the first time and unacquainted with its ways, and were sleeping with a friend, and you should be suddenly awakened by the rushing-by of the noisy fireengines, doubtless you would be greatly frightened and possibly terrified by fear of some impending danger. You arouse your friend that you may seek a place of safety. He is not frightened in the least. Why? Because he knows what it is, and says to you, That is only a fire-engine going by. His knowledge gives him quietness of mind. Your lack of knowledge causes you dread. What is needed, therefore, is a knowledge of the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The Bible is the most profound book in the world; and why not, if it was indited by Jehovah? It also has comfort for the mourner, sympathy for the weeping, hope for the downcast, and joy for all who seek to drink of its life-giving fountain. The Prophet Isaiah, chapter 61, verses 1 and 2, writes: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, ... to comfort all that mourn.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Comfort from the Plan of God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font22">ET me first call your attention to the grand outlines of God's glorious plan for bring</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">ing joy to all the world, as set forth in the Bible. Then as you study the details you will be the more delighted, gladdened and comforted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">I shall not have time here to read all of the passages, but I will cite them for you, and you can then read them for yourself and enjoy them the more. By Isaiah, chapter 45, verse 18, and by Matthew, chapter 5, verse 5, we are told that the earth was created for the everlasting home of man. When God had it sufficiently prepared to sustain human life, he brought forth the king for whom it was created, as we read in Genesis, chapter 1, verses 26 and 27: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">From what follows we can readily see several points in which that first man, the king of the earth, was in the image of God. God is perfect. All His work is perfect. (See Deuteronomy 32: 4.) Therefore Adam was perfect, for he was God’s masterpiece of earthly creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">God had eternal life, was without beginning or end. He arranged that Adam might have everlasting life, by providing the perfect food and water of paradise, and the tree of life of which he might partake and live for ever. God was the Sovereign of the Universe; all creation was subject to Him. Man was given the sovereignty of the earth, and all other earthly creatures were made subject to him. In these and other respects Adam was in the image and likeness of his Creator.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>What a World It Might Have Been</span></h3>
<p><span class="font22">EHOLD King Adam in his beauty and perfection of mind and body, sovereign of a</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280502_files/g_E_19280502-30.png" alt="" style="width:62pt;height:75pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">glorious domain, and with orders to bring forth and fill the earth with his offspring, as perfect, beautiful and godlike as himself, and a royal paradise as the dwelling-place for all! Can you picture a more attractive prospect? An earth filled with perfect human beings, grand, godlike, free from every evil, and God as their Friend and Protector? All this was a possibility, and actually in the provision made by Jehovah for man. </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What a glad world this might have been!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But, not very long after, a very black cloud overshadowed this delightful prospect and shut out the light of God’s favor from Adam. Adam knowingly and wilfully disobeyed his Creator’s law and thereby became a criminal. At the trial he pleaded guilty. The sentence of death was passed upon him. He was driven from his magnificent paradisaic home, to the unprepared conditions outside. He was denied the privilege of further partaking of the life-giving foods and fruits of paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">He might live the best he could on the impure foods and conditions without. He did live for nearly one thousand years, but eventually he died. He is still dead, and has no knowledge of what has taken place since his death, even as the Bible informs us: “There is no work, nor</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest.” Adam is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Although sentenced to death, Adam might bring forth children, and many sons and daugh</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">ters were born to him before he died. But to ; none of them could he give perfect life, nor provide them with the perfect food necessary to j sustain everlasting life. Hence they also died. ■ But, before they died they also brought forth children until finally you and I were born; but</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22">&gt; we too inherited the disease of death, and every accepted ' ache and pain in our bodies bears testimony to f the truth of the apostle’s declaration which ; reads: “As by one man sin entered into the [ world, and death by sin; and so death [the pun-f ishment for sin] passed upon all men, for that ■ all have sinned.”—Romans 5:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">In other phrase, by the law of heredity death passed from father to child, and thus all were imperfect and were counted by Jehovah as unworthy of everlasting life. We are also witnesses that we know of no one now on earth who possesses perfect physical life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">no object in permitting it. The history of man from Eden to the present is but a record of sorrow, sickness, pain, pestilences, famines, wars and death, which have swept over him like storms, and the wonder is that he has not been swept into extinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">How sad the actual experience of man has been. Yet from this terrible condition God has</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">promised that joy shall spring forth, and from hearts that have been plowed by the angel of death and soaked with the tears of despair shall spring forth praise and rejoicing unto life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Adam was called a son of God in the genealogy of Christ, as recorded in the third chapter of Luke, which reads: “Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.” God had another Son, who was not of human nature, but a glorious angelic being, called the Logos, now better known as Christ Jesus. He was greatly beloved by Jehovah and had been associated with God in all the work of Creation. —Proverbs 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">According to Hebrews 12:2, God laid before</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">the Logos a proposition suggested by the following words, “Who for the joy that was set before him,” etc. Because of this the Logos was willing to become the Redeemer of the wayward son Adam. Jesus himself refers to this in John 3:16, which is sometimes called the whole Bible in twenty-five words, which reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Christ gladly the offer and came to earth to save</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Adam and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■l</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Times of Restitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">W</span><span class="font22">HILE here Christ said to His disciples: “The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” The question at once arises, What was lost? The Bible answer is, that it was all that Adam had, and might have had, personally and for his posterity. Did Adam possess anything in heaven or of a heavenly or spiritual nature? No, not a thing. Everything he possessed was of the earth, earthly. His life was human, fitted to the earth; his dominion was on the earth, and all his interests here. All these he lost. Did Jesus find that which was lost? Yes, as He explained in the parable of the lost sheep. See Matthew 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">What is Jesus to do with what He has found? Let the inspired Apostle Peter answer. Speaking of Jesus, he says, “Whom the heaven must receive [retain] </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">until the times of restitution</span><span class="font22"> of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:21) </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Restitution!</span><span class="font22"> What does that mean? Why, to restore something which had been lost and which has been found. Christ was not to return to heaven with what He found and remain there for ever. At the proper time He was to return to earth with His found treasure and offer to give it back to the original owner and the heirs thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If we lose something which we greatly prize, do we not greatly rejoice if some one finds it and restores it to us? Surely! Now that we know what was lost we can readily see what is to be restored. This we have already seen to be the possessions of Adam; viz., human life in its perfection, earthly domain and all the glory and honors associated therewith, and all our loved ones whom we have lost through death. As we all shared with Adam in the loss, we are all t*</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">share with him in the restoration. This is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">tessage of good tidings of which the angels sang at the birth of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If Adam never possessed anything in heaven, or of heavenly conditions, then, using the word </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">restoration</span><span class="font22"> in the proper sense, God himself could not </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">give back</span><span class="font22"> to Adam things which he never had. And there is no promise that God intends to give mankind in general a home in heaven or spirit nature. On the contrary, God has promised to restore paradise on earth and give it to the children of men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">reads, “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.” Christ also said, “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” He did not say, ‘Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">heaven.’ We are, therefore, every one of us, vitally interested in this wonderful arrangement by Jehovah, for we are all to come in for our share of the inheritance lost by Adam but found by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>First Saved, Then Informed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font22">THE apostle wants us to be able to assure ourselves on this point, and so tells us clearly in Bomans 5:18. We quote from the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weymouth</span><span class="font22"> translation, which transfers the thought of the original Greek more clearly into modern English: “It follows then that just as a result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a lifegiving acquittal which extends to the whole race. For as through the disobedience of the one individual the mass of mankind were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One [Christ] the mass of mankind will be constituted righteous [freed from that first sentence] .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In other words, because of Adam’s sin the whole world was rejected, and because of Christ’s becoming the ransom for Adam, the whole world will be lifted from that condemnation. This does not guarantee eternal life to any one, but opens the way whereby all who desire may obtain everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">This throws a flood of light upon the apostle’s words in 1 Timothy 2:2-6, which have been heretofore so obscured. We read, “God . . . will have </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font22"> men to be </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">saved</span><span class="font22"> and [i^en] to come</span></p><img src="g_E_19280502_files/g_E_19280502-32.png" alt="" style="width:321pt;height:43pt;">
<p><span class="font22">that the salvation here referred to is the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">salva</span><span class="font22">tion from the grave, and that the purpose </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">God is to bring forth all from the grave </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font22">they might come to a knowledge of the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">truth, </span><span class="font22">that they might obtain everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">As a means to an end, God designed a </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">king</span><span class="font22">dom under the rulership of His beloved </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Son, </span><span class="font22">Christ Jesus, with power to carry out all </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font22">hovah’s glorious promises. All the prophets </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">the Old Testament speak of this kingdom </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font22">earth’s only hope. Luke says that Christ </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">went </span><span class="font22">through all the cities and villages preaching and showing the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">glad tidings</span><span class="font22"> of the kingdom of God. (Luke 8:1) Jesus taught His disciples to pray, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font22">earth as in heaven.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Object of Parables and Miracles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">E</span><span class="font22">ACH parable of Jesus was to describe scum feature of that kingdom, and His miracles were to illustrate or show the working method of its beneficent rule. At the command </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Christ, divine power repaired the disease-wracked bodies of the sick; and fever, palsj^ leprosy, and every known disease gave way, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font22">the sufferers were restored to health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The blind were made to see, the deaf to </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">hear; </span><span class="font22">the lame to leap, and the tongue of the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">dumb </span><span class="font22">was loosened to praise the Giver of all </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">good</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">gifts. The prophets declare that when </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font22">kingdom shall function, all the blind eyes shai be opened, all the deaf ears unstopped, all </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">lame leap for joy, and all the dumb tongues </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font22">loosened that they may sing Jehovah’s praise. See Isaiah 65: 21-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">This is a glorious hope for those living </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">whea </span><span class="font22">Christ returns; but what about our loved </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">ones </span><span class="font22">who have died ? Ah, that is the comforting </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font22">of this message. Christ is Lord of the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"> as </span><span class="font22">well as of the living. Therefore He performed miracles to show to us the reality of the resurrection, that we might have a firm foundation for.our hope to see our loved ones again; that even now, when the tears of sorrow run dow the cheeks, the eyes of faith might perceive </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">hope for the future and enable us to </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">rejoice, </span><span class="font22">even in our sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Let us read 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4: </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">“Blessed be </span><span class="font22">God, even the Father of our Lord </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font22">Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God </span><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font22">all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">What does the word “comfort” mean? If there were no pain, sickness, sorrow or broken hearts, there would be no need for the word comfort. When we are in bodily distress our loved ones bring pillows and comforts to ease the body. But there are aches and pains of the heart and mind which such comforts can not reach. It is comfort for the heartaches that the apostle refers to in the above cited text. The Word of God can supply this to ease the aching and broken hearts. Let us apply it to our hearts now.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Comfort for the People of God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">S</span><span class="font22">PECIAL cases need special attention. Today pain is caused by the loss of your loved ones and I bring to you the words of the apostle as recorded in 1 Thessalonians 4:13, “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.” Who are those who sleep in Jesus? The whole world; every son of Adam as we have already noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Quoting again from verse 16, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice [authority] of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dead in Christ </span><span class="font22">shall rise first.” The “dead in Christ” are those who have been found worthy to obtain the heavenly reward, sometimes called the Lamb's wife or the sons of God, and who are to be associated with Christ in bringing the blessings to the waiting, groaning world. Then the apostle adds, “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” Do not use the words of fallible man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Although this message is addressed to those who are running for the heavenly calling during this age, yet their exaltation to glory and power is closely associated with the blessings for all mankind, as the apostle tells us in Romans 8:19, “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">manifestation</span><span class="font22"> of the </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sons of God</span><span class="font22"> [those who shall be the joint-heirs of Christ].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Jesus will soon have all the world understand how this message of hope can and does apply, not only to those who are alive and can hear, but that we can apply it to our hearts on behalf of those who are now sleeping in the tomb. Let me assure you of this, that it may greatly </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font22">fort you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awakening of Jairus’ Daughter</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">arrived with word that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font22">THE eighth chapter of Luke we read of the death and awakening of the daughter of Jairus, the ruler of a synagogue. His daughter was very sick and her father hurried to find Jesus that he might bring Him to his home and possibly save his loved one. Jesus was some distance away, and it took the father considerable time to find Him. He had just reached Jesus and was telling of his urgent errand, when a servant of the father who had left the the daughter had died. Now let us read, beginning with verse 49, “While he [Jairus] yet spake [to Jesus], there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. And her spirit [life] came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat [food].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Why did Jesus say she was asleep? Sleep means temporary unconsciousness, which will terminate in being awakened. Thus would Jesus say, She will awake. This incident was specially recorded for your comfort and mine, to illustrate the power of Jesus over death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Can you picture the change that came over that home in those few minutes? There were the mourners; preparations were under way for the burial; the undertaker there, and doubtless the grave had been ordered. The sunshine of the home had gone out, the dread cloud of death overshadowing all. At the word of Jesus everything changed; too quickly to be comprehended in a moment. Their beloved was alive and reaching out her arms to embrace her father and mother, and rushing toward them in her joy. They, too amazed to take in the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">■with tears still on their cheeks, staring at their daughter as she ran to them. Was their loved uae actually alive or was it all a dream? Then the reaction of joy that it was all true. Who ■can doubt their expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord for it all! The sunshine of gladness burst into the home like a flood of light from the sun at noonday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Suppose that were your home, and that experience yours. Perhaps the shadow of death hangs over your home today, but listen. The record of that incident was kept that it might comfort you and that you might have hope. The joyful part of the experience in that home in Palestine so many years ago will be duplicated in your home some day and the sunshine of joy will burst in its fulness as surely as it did in the home of Jairus. Your loved one will as surely return when Jesus calls.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Awakening of the Son of the Widow of Ncdn</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">I</span><span class="font22">N THE seventh chapter of Luke we read of a widowed mother following her only son to the cemetery. “Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier [coffin]: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he [Jesus] delivered him to his mother.” Follow this incident carefxdly, for it also was written for your comfort. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">That funeral procession had a sudden change of direction. The pall-bearers had lost their burden; the grave had no victim. We can picture the joy that followed the command of the Master and the rush of the mother and the son to meet and embrace each other. The whole city rejoiced with them, and praised God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If that experience were yours, would you rejoice ? Of course you would. You couldn’t help it, nor would you wish to. Now let me read another text to you, 1 Corinthians 10:11, “Now all these things happened unto them for en-samples [types]: and they are written for our admonition.” And still another, Romans 15:4,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">For whatsoever things were written aforeti &gt;ere written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">the scriptures </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">mig^st </span><span class="font22">have hope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">When Jesus co</span><span class="font22" style="text-decoration:underline;">mman</span><span class="font22">ded the young man to arise, divine power was exercised upon the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">body </span><span class="font22">to repair whatever was broken down and </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font22">caused death. The lungs were then set in </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">mo</span><span class="font22">tion, the heart started to beat; blood </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">reached </span><span class="font22">the brain, consciousness returned, and </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">young man was again alive. He had been </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font22">paired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">He had not become an angel nor a spirit </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font22">ing, but had been brought back to life as </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">a man, </span><span class="font22">as real, as personal and as human as before </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font22">died, the same man, with all his faculties </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">memory, reason and knowledge.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Awakening of Lazarus and of All</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ A </span><span class="font22">STILL more noted miracle is recorded </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font22">the eleventh chapter of John. It is too long to read here, and you will enjoy it better if </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font22">take the time and read it for yourself. It is </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font22">of the most comforting chapters of the Bible. </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font22">am just asking that you read it carefully </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font22">get the comfort that thousands of others have found there. What is it ? Another sample of </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">power and purpose of God and a source of comfort for those who mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Now listen while I read, and apply the comfort to your heart. It is found in John 5: 28, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">29, </span><span class="font22">“Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font22">the which </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all that are in the graves</span><span class="font22"> shall hear his [the Son of man’s] voice, and shall </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">come </span><span class="font22">forth.” Do you take in what that really means? That includes the loved one who has just gone, and all your loved ones, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, relatives, and </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font22">their relatives, every one who has died </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">as a child </span><span class="font22">of Adam. Jesus has purchased them all and </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font22">promised to awaken every one and bring </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font22">forth from the sleep of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">You may ask in amazement, How? I reply, Look at the illustrations which were given </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font22">your edification and encouragement. Will </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font22">return sick as when they died? No!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Again, study the incidents. Not one of </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font22">awakened returned sick, but comparatively </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Will they come back to all the trials and </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">dis</span><span class="font22">tresses of another world like this? No! </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font22">then Christ will be King of all the earth, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font22">the prophets tell us that Christ will give </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">people health instead of sickness; singing for sighing; joy for the ashes of death; peace </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font22">stead of war; quietness instead of trouble, and that every one may have a home of his own, with nothing to molest or make afraid. All that will be the work of the kingdom of God. So the apostle says, “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.”—1 Thessalonians </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font22">:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Is it any wonder that the disciples were eager to know when Christ would set up His kingdom, and asked Him many questions about the time ? He did not satisfy their curiosity as to the exact date, but gave them information by which they could easily discern its proximity. These signs are all about us, and we can all see them if we know what to look for. Have you noticed them ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If so it has cheered your heart to realize that the kingdom is rapidly taking its place and will goon be in full power and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Indeed, it is so near that doubtless many of</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font22"><a name="bookmark147"></a>i </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Signs That the Awakening Time Is At Hand </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I.-</span></h3>
<p><span class="font29">L</span><span class="font22">ET us read a little from the Lord’s description : “And there shall be signs in the sun, &gt;&nbsp;and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the j earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the ; sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers i of heaven shall be shaken. . . . And when these </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">j things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draw-eth nigh.”—Luke 21:25-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Can you see how dose the kingdom is ? Then it will not be very long before your loved ones will be coming back and the experiences of the Jairus home, and the others before referred to, will be the experience of the millions of homes which have been saddened and desolated by death. Read again, ‘Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth and rejoice in the abundance of peace.’ Your loved one will return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If I might offer a suggestion that I have personally found very helpful, and observation shows that it has helped many others, it is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Do not spend time in looking back. It does you no good, nor any one else. Look forward with joyful anticipation to the reunion with your loved ones, as promised by Jehovah, and join your petition with all true followers of Christ in the prayer He taught His disciples: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” This will assist you to meet the trials still to be met and overcome, and will also take the sting out of the wound of separation and give you a rest of mind and heart which nothing else can. You will find it a comfort indeed for your mourning heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Listen to the words of encouragement recorded in Jeremiah’s prophecy: “Thus saith Jehovah, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; and they [thy loved ones] shall come again from the land of the enemy.” (Jeremiah 31:16) This will yet be a glad and glorious earth, for God shall restore paradise and again smile upon His creature, man, and grant to “whosoever will” the privilege of becoming sons of God and rejoicing in His favor for ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">[A Juvenile Bible story radiocast from Station WORD, Chicago, by C. D. Nicholson*]</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22">Haggai was raised up to urge </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the people to </span><span class="font22">rebuild the temple of the Lord. </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">He said many </span><span class="font22">things about the temple which </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font22">only </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font22">shadowy fulfilment in his day, </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">for they </span><span class="font22">were intended by the Lord to apply </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font22">especially down at this end of the age, when the real temple of Jehovah is to be established on the earth and when He shall become their </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">God and </span><span class="font22">they shall be His people. But this prophet also spoke of a time of trouble which must </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">intervene be</span><span class="font22">fore </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">new heavens and the </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">new earth are </span><span class="font22">established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Zechariah’s Message: The message of God’s prophet Zechariah is similar in many respects to that of Haggai, because he was used to bring encouragement to those who were rebuilding the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem. However, his message is more comprehensive than that of Haggai in that it contains considerable detail concerning a large number of subjects merely touched upon by Haggai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Indeed, Zechariah covers </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">a number of </span><span class="font22">subjects which Haggai does not </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font22">mention. Among these is a prophecy in reference to the birth of the Savior, how He would offer Himself to the Jewish people as their King, and that He would be rejected of them and be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Malachi’s Message: The Prophet Malachi was the last one to write his message to the Israelites. This prophecy was written about four hundred and fifty years before Christ came, and indeed we are warranted in the conclusion that Malachi was the last prophet of Jehovah until the coming of John the Baptist just previous to the coming of Jesus at His first advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The message of Malachi was largely directed to the false religious system of the Jews. He told them: “The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.” Then he condemned the priests for their unfaithfulness, saying that they had departed out of the way, had caused many to stumble </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font22">the law, and had corrupted the covenant which God had made with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Malachi also had considerable to say about the great time of trouble with which </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">age </span><span class="font22">shall end. That is the day of </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s wrath, and </span><span class="font22">the fire mentioned is the fire of God’s jealousy, not literal fire.—Malachi 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">B1Q</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font29">T</span><span class="font22">HIS lesson will take up the study of the last of the prophets that God sent to the Hebrew nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Habakkuk’s Message: Much of Habakkuk’s message was fulfilled in a limited way by and through the Chaldeans with whom the Israelites had to deal. However, Bible students believe that the Chaldeans, as well as the Israelites, were typical of certain classes of people now living in the world, and therefore believe that many of the things spoken by Habakkuk were intended to be understood and to have their application at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Certain portions of his prophecies were intended especially for this end of the age. For instance, the second chapter, second and third verses read: “And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” Surely this was not fulfilled in the days of Habakkuk, because God’s plan was not clearly understood then; but now it has been made plain upon tables, or charts, and books, which make it so clear that any one reading it is able to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Zephaniah’s Message: The Prophet Zephaniah had considerable to say about “the day of Jehovah”, which he describes as a day of wrath, trouble and distress; a day of desolation, darkness, clouds and gloominess. He says of that day that it will bring distress upon men; that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the Lord; that neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath. (Zephaniah 1:14-18) Then he gives a message for the people, who are living just previous to the great day of the Lord’s anger. See Zephaniah 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In these words the prophet is describing the time in which we are now living. The day of the Lord’s anger is now upon the world, and those who seek the Lord and seek to be meek and righteous will fare a great deal better during this time of trouble than will those who are proud, haughty and stiff-necked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Haggai’s Message: The people of Israel had scarcely reached their homeland after the long exile in foreign countries when the Prophet</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">' The Children’s Own Radio Story</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Story</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">O</span><span class="font22">UR radio story tonight will be of the birth of Jesus, the Son of God, who took upon Himself human life and sacrificed that life on </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font22">cross in order that all of Adam’s fallen children might have the chance for eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Jehovah God selected a very good woman to </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font22">the mother of Jesus. She came of an excellent family, and was one of David’s direct descendants. In other words, David was her ever-so-many-times great grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">We all know who King David was. The Word </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font22">God speaks highly of him, for he was a man who loved God and obeyed Him. He was a poet and musician, and wrote much of the beautiful book of the Bible called the Psalms. The holy prophets of hundreds of years before the birth of Jesus had foretold that very event, and that Jesus would be born of the family of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">David was a descendant of Abraham, and thus we see how every word spoken by the great Jehovah is always fulfilled. For, as you remember, it is written in the Bible by several prophets of the Old Testament that Jehovah said to Abraham, “In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.&quot; The blessing of the nations is of course to come about by the payment of the ransom price for Adam’s life, and the restoration of all his children to life again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Abraham was the ancestor of David; King David was the ancestor of Joseph; Joseph was the husband of Mary. Mary is the name of the good woman whom the Lord God, Jehovah, chose to be the mother of Jesus. Mary was of the line of David, too, and thus is beautifully shown the perfect truth of every promise made to man by God: In the seed of Abraham (that is, through Abraham’s family, by King David and Mary) was born the Lord Christ Jesus, who will bless all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Jesus was born in a stable, the stable of a little inn near Bethlehem. Joseph and Mary had been traveling and had arrived at this little inn, and requested to be put up there for the night. But the house was full, and they had no room for any one except in the stable with the horses and other animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">So Joseph and Mary were allowed to sleep in the stable, and that night the most important •vent in the history of the world took place in</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Four</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">that little stable in Bethlehem. Jesus, the Christ, the Son of God, was born, and they laid Him in a manger, where the cattle received their feed. Joseph and Mary were poor, and could not give the holy child Jesus silk robes or rich clothing of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Remember, this little babe was the Son of God, the all-powerful Logos who created the heavens we see about us and the earth we walk upon. But such was His love for us that He left the high glories of heaven to become a little human baby, born of the line of David, that the prophecy concerning Him might be fulfilled and that all the nations of the earth might be blessed with the hope of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The young babe Jesus was wrapped in nothing more grand or splendid than a big piece of clean cloth of some sort. No royal robes, no servants, no crown, no palace; and yet He was a King, the King of kings. Of His own free will He came upon the earth and, as a man, suffered death for us, that we might live. Who can fail to love and praise such a Savior!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22">inn where shepherds and every</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">Now, in the fields near the little Jesus was born, there were some watching their flocks. It was night, thing was quiet and dark. Suddenly they were surrounded by a great light, and the angel of the Lord stood before them. The shepherds were naturally very much frightened at this glorious apparition, but the angel hastened to reassure them. “And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a man-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then the Bible narrative continues: “And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then the angels disappeared, and the shepherds talked about the wonderful thing that had just happened, and said, “Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.” And they went in haste, and found</span></p>

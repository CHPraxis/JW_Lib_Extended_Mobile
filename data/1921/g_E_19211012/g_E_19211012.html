<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Problem </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Newton T. Hartshorn</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">F ALL who stand out on the pages of history, the mighty men of this peculiar generation are the most unfortunate. It is said that circumstances make the man, and that is true: but circumstances may unmake the man, and this is equally true. At no time in the history of the world has the need of truly great men been so urgent as now. It is not that there are no men now who would be great under the same conditions that made other men great in history, but that the issues are so varied and the problems so intricate and vast that no man or • combination of men is equal to solving them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole world under modem scientific development has merged into one great economic unit; and as just stated, men cannot manage it. Under divine direction Economics rule. Big Business, Politics and Ecclesiasticism, as we have known them, are but the servants waiting on Economics, How quickly a failure of crops and a famine put them all out of commission!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Men like the Czar of Russia or the German Kaiser may imagine themselves to be Samsons, swinging the jawbone of an ass: but the Samson has vanished, and even the jawbone is but a memory. It may yet come to pass, however, that the Kaiser, in view of what is to come, may be considered as very fortunate to have landed as softly from his dizzy height as he has done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Of^U the men of this generation, Ex-President Wilson had the golden opportunity to become one of the greatest men in history. If he had stuck to his fourteen points, had made no compron^ise and had returned to America still insisting, he would have been re-elected. It was the consciousness of defeat that paralyzed him. But Ex-President Wilson is no exception. The man or the combination of men does not live that can solve the problem and bring order out of chaos. Lloyd George, Briand, Lenine, and all the rest are doomed; their thanatopsis awaits them. They are doomed because they essay to reconstruct, and uphold an order of things which the divine command has already decreed for utter destruction, by the inexorable working of the law of cause and effect. A billion-ton economic sledge-hammer is descending on aH who essay to uphold and perpetuate that old order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">President Harding is no exception. In “The Mirrors of Washington,” a satire on the fourteen big men of the country, the following appears about him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“He compensates for his own defects. Almost as good as greatness is a knowledge of your own limitations, and Mr. Harding knows his thoroughly. Out of his modesty, his desire to reinforce himself, baa proceeded the strongest Cabinet that Washington has seen for a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gsn-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">eration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Very good! But if his statement reported in the press is true: “The people have misjudged the great financiers [Big Business]; they sincerely desire the public good above their personal interests,” it shows where his policy of good will to everybody is leading him. The size of the gold brick they have handed the American people through Mr. Harding, we may be sure, will be about the size of the sum of all the spare cash in the pockets of those same dear confiding American people. This same old jawbone of an ass gilded in the latest fashion will land Mr. Harding as deep in the mire as Mr. Wilson's visionary fourteen points mired that Samson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Human nature never yet changed in one night A silk purse was never made out of a sow's ear. While there are quite as liberal, unselfish, kindly men among the great capitalists, on an average, as among poorer people, yet the very fact that they have secured and hold princely fortunes is proof that money has been the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mam </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">thing with them; and it will continue to be the main thing. The fact that love of it is the root</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of all evil is as true today as it ever was; and in the inevitable squeeze, the famine and anar-shy that are bound to follow as a result of the insane World War, men of wealth will be as de* termined to hold possession of their wealth as . they ever were, determined to . safeguard and <sup>:</sup> perpetuate the old order; and the Dillion-ton hammer will come down on them. Some of them, no doubt, when they see the terrific nature of the crash, in sympathy for the suffering of others will sacrifice their last dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said that it would be as difficult for a .rich man to enter the kingdom of God as for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. He referred to that little side-gate in the wall of the city, which was called “the needle’s eye”, where belated travelers entered after the great gate was shut for the night; but the camel had to be unloaded, made to kneel, and was squeezed through. All the wealthy will have to unload and kneel, before they can get in; the unloading of most of them, however, will be involuntary. The process is now commencing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Anyone who is not a natural-born idiot knows that the term “great financiers” is another name for Big Business, and that it rules ecclesiasti-oism and politics (an unholy accord). How quickly the Interchurch World Movement collapsed when it went against the Steel Trust!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">All who think that there is any Christianity in it are deceived, blind as bats. They do not realize that the old order of things (Satan’s kingdom) is being completely torn down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Wellington, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln, all combined in one, could not save Satan’s kingdom when the divine order goes forth to tear it down! Neither can all the clergy in the world. “We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.” Every one who tries to save Satan’s kingdom will fall under the economic trip-hammer, afidjbe crushed to pulp. One man, the only truly great man of this generation, Pastor Bussell, forewarned them all. Admit that Pastor Bussell was right! Never! Very well, keep right on, and you will get there, under the billion-ton trip-hammek. You may get through the eye of the needle;-but as the ablest chemist who perfected T. N. T. stated (referring to the remark of Jesus about the rich man’s getting through the eye of a needle), he would reduce them to nitric acid (the human body reduced to its lowest liquid chemical form is nitric add) and squirt them through. The process of reduction would not be very painful after the first second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said, referring to this time: “They that exalt themselves shall be abased, and they that humble themselves shall b e exalted”. The wealthy who thoroughly humble themselves and seek righteousness will not need to be reduced to nitric acid to get into the kingdom, but may be of the “millions nonliving [who] will never die&quot;. But they have no time to lose in getting ready. It would take some time for the excessively rich man to unload voluntarily; but it will not take long to unload him involuntarily when the cyclone breaks loose. But he would personally get no credit for an involuntary unloading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Is not the philosophy, plainly to be seen, in this situation, unanswerableT Act on it; escape the trip-hammer, and run the gauntlet unscathed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said, referring to the end of the age and the tearing down of Satan’s kingdom: “Whoever shall faff on this stone [referring to Himself and His doctrine] shall be bruised [humbled and seek righteousness] but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder”. (Matthew 21:44) There you have the billion- . ton economic trip-hammer, and back of it ths</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">command, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God ' <sup>1 </sup>with all thy mind, soul and strength and thy &quot;&nbsp;neighbor as thyself”. The time has come when *</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that law is to be enforced by economic law. You \ can, if you prefer, be a bat in the orevioe or</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup>Communism or Socialism can save you, you have another guess coming. Get down to bedrock facts — unadulterated truth — and act before the cyclone strikes.

<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Civilization Complex?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">NE often hears reference made to the com. plexity of our modern civilization; but few . • have wondered if civilization could be modern if otherwise. Perhaps none have ever interro-- gated this common consensus of opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is generally conceded that increase of popillation and growth of cities coupled with better modes of communication, modern inventions, world commerce and enlightenment are the causes which operate to make civilization com, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. plex Modern conditions, the economists tell us,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;'call for more laws and legislation, more asy-. luma and hospitals, more complicated systems of distribution of food-stuff, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is recognized that the business world is / one mad rush of intense nervous strain—work and worry. Dreamers and idealists have sought relief from this condition in the lonely hermit life. These advocates of the simple life state that we must assume the habitat of the fabled cave man if we would enjoy the closest communion -with nature. Some of the more advanced advocates of this principle even urge their disciples to try roughing it in the nude state as . being the most idealistic. So the story is circulated of two young ladies roaming through Rocky Mountain forests with only nature for a garb..that they might report on the merits of the tJteory. But the present-day city resident needs not await the return verdict of their re*” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port to realize that such a life would have its</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drawbacks, provided he-has tried camp life and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">mosquito^ during his summer vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As a matter of fact the climax of a model civilization would be idealistic simplicity. How* ever, the complexity of modern civilization is not apparent but real. Our civilization is a net. work of entangled confusion. We find throughout the land rival institutions doing the work</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By H. E. Coffey </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">which only one should do. Competition, it has been said, is the life of business, but like war we must concede that in effect it is destructive. These conditions came with the gift of modern enlightenment; and were brought about by the influence of Satan exercised through the hearts and minds of men. Selfishness dominating the human heart has used for the benefit of the lordly few these discoveries which should have been for the common good. Thus has resulted our castes from rich to poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Hence we see that the cause for the complexity of civilization lies not in civilization itself but in the imperfect human instrumentality through which it must operate. Just as God’s dealings with the nation of Israel demonstrated the inability of imperfect humanity to keep a perfect law, so also His favors to the gentiles are to show that man’s efforts to bring about righteous conditions cannot succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Only by the application of the divine remedy can order be brought out of the chaotic conditions into which the world is fast drifting. When the commanding and authoritative voice of the Lord speaks peace to the raging elements of human passion, then will be ushered in an ideal civilization without complexity. Love will be the divine law which will operate in the hearts and minds of the people to the exclusion and banishment of selfishness and greed. When the gift of everlasting life is granted the people they will no longer need to go down into the tomb and there will be no need of costly records but in the perfect minds of men all the necessary records will be stored. There will be no need of doctors, undertakers, professors, and “D. D.’s”. Yet there will be every convenience that the human heart could wish for and life in full will be enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sun • Spots </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Newton T. Hartshorn</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">U. the great events in the world that have marked the changes in the condition of the . human race have correlated with changes in the physical world. For instance, the change in the duration and character of the life of the human race at the great deluge was accompanied by changes in the climate of the world, caused by the devitalizing glaciation that followed the : deluge and by the marked increase of nitrogen in the atmosphere, causing fermentation, a factor in decay and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the deluge, what was considered a normal life for man was under 1,000 years; physical conditions determined it. After the deluge the normal life of a man was reckoned under 70 years, and physical conditions of the earth determined this also. The fact that it is quite ccmmcp now for human life to be extended to 100 years finds its explanation in the d</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imin</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ished ice area at the north pole, which has been followed by greater vitality in human and vegetable conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Whether sun-spots are the result of modern solar conditions we cannot determine. As in all other sciences, astronomy is still in its embryonic stage, but indications seem to point to the fact that changes are taking place in the sun as well as in the earth, and that the earth’s changes to some extent originate in the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Astronomers are coming to the conclusion that the appearance of spots on the sun are periodic, persisting for seven years and mainly disappearing for eleven years; that the seven years of sun-spots are characterized by greater pre. cipitation in summer and winter and by lower average temperature, although each period of 18 years inclusive seems to l&gt;e a few degrees on the average warmer than the previous period. This explains the gradual subsidence of glaciation, in the northern hemisphere, the all-the-yc;u-?bund ice line in the arctic regions slowly re treating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Observation seems to establish the fact that of the seven years of sun-spot prevalence on the sun the l^rst and last years are characterized by great eccentricity of climate—a spotty condition on flic earth—some parts entirely without rain for many months and in other parts an abnormal rainfall. The sun-spots seem to originate at the poles of the sun and are probably caused by local centers of electrical or magnetic disturbance which throw out into space spotty electrical spheres or lanes. These do not strike the earth. As the spots continue to develop they appear to spread toward the equator of the sun, and in the sixth or seventh ■ year to reach it, and in that year to reach the.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">earth and the other planets which are on the plane of the sun’s equator. Accordingly the frt£ quent display of aurora and other electrical and magnetic phenomena result, as we have seen, in spots in this, the last of the seven sun-spot years which commenced in 1914. Astronomers . have stated that a peculiar maliferous influence seems to emanate from these spots; and the conditions psychological and physical prevailing since 1914 seem to bear out this conclusion. The dry weather in England, France, and Southern Russia, causing failure of crops and famine in Russia, show's the effect of physical changes and demonstrates the dependence of human and vegetable life on physical conditions. <sub>u</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The eleven years between the seven years of . sun-spots seem to be characterized by a low average of rainfall general all over the world . and a higher average of temperature. We are now just entering that period, and we may look with great interest on the effect upon the human race following the low physical and psychological condition of mankind resulting from the confusion, destruction, and moral degradation of the great war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus, evidently speaking of this time when answering the question of the disciples, “What shall be the sign of thy presence and of the end of the world [age]?” (Matthew 24:3-7) said: “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places”; and He likened this time also to the deluge (Matthew 24:37): &quot;But as the days of Noe [Noah] were, so shall also the coming [Greek, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">parousta—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">presence] of the Son of man be”. The prophet Zephaniah evidently referred to the same time when he said: &quot;Wait ye upon ’ me, saith the lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations that I may assemble the kingdoms , to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth [the present i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">evil order—Satan’s kingdom] shall be devoured ‘ with the fire of my jealousy”. “Seek righteous-&quot; ness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of theLonn’sanger.”—Zeph. 3:8,9; 2:3. ■ • All living upon the earth, except Noah and ’ - '■ his family, perished in the deluge; and in this deluge of trouble, the antitype of the Noachic deluge, it would appear, all will perish except ' • those who seek righteousness and humility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus (in Matthew 24:21, 22) said, referring to ’ this time evidently, and in answer to the same question of the disciples: ‘Tor then shall be , great tribulation, such as was not since the bell ginning of the world [this “world&quot; or order of ' &nbsp;&nbsp;things—Satan’s kingdom—commenced after the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">deluge; another world or order of things prevailed in the antediluvian age] to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As at the deluge, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a new</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> world commenced, so a new order of things will commence immedi-c ately aftej this antitypical “deluge”. As after the Noachic deluge only the few—the faithful family of Noah — survived to begin anew to people the earth in the new world, the new order; so now only the righteous and the meek in heart intention will pass through </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> deluge to be the nucleus to institute the new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The human race then will start on the upgrade back to the restitution of eternal life lost by Adam (Acts 3:20, 21), the resurrection of the dead being one of the early features of the new age (world). The millions—among whom the meek and righteous will doubtless predominate— that pass through the deluge, now on, being the nucleus to start to receive them; and aB'the first installment of the resurrection comes back these will help prepare for still other companies to return. &quot;Marvel not at this; for the hour isAeming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and come forth.” (John 5:28) Sincere Christians cannot deny the accuracy of the statements of Jesus. The righteous and nteek will be ready to take hold and help take care of<sup>1</sup> still greater companies returning from th# grave. The unrighteous and selfish who are awakened, and who will not take hold and help care for those coming back, are held in restraint — condemned to restraint and judged by their willingness or unwillingness to serve others who need their help. So we see at the end of this new world or age (the Millennial age), another harvest will follow, as at the end of the antediluvian age and of the gospel age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">At the end of the antediluvian age or world only eight persons, Noah and his family, were sufficiently meek and righteous to pass through * that deluge. All others poked fun at that old, crazy-head Noah and his sons for building a ship on dry land. “What silly nonsense r And ' । today, at the end of this the gospel age (this evil world, Satan’s kingdom), people sneer and poke fun at those lunatics who are a lot of । calamity howlers, saying a great time of trouble I is near when this “world” will all be “burned up”. “What silly nonsense!” As a matter of fact those “lunatics” do not claim that the literal world will be burned up, but that the old order of things will be burned up in the heat of war, hate, starvation, pestilence, and anarchy: that will be hot enough. Already the heat of famine, social unrest, and debt in Europe is dif- . ficult to bear; and in America it is warming up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The end of the age now just about to commence Jesus refers to in Matthew 25:32, when all who have been resurrected will have had an ■ opportunity to learn righteousness but when those who have remained selfish, proud, conceited and rebellious will be placed on the left side, opposite to the meek and righteous, and the King (Christ) will condemn them to eternal torment </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Oh, no! To the second death, which will be annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions will pass through this present deluge (time of trouble) and enter the new highly vitalized physical conditions in which human life will naturally be prolonged nearly a thousand years. By the end of the thousand years, the earth will be completed — a new physical </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. i </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">condition will have obtained of which scientific men — geologists, pathologists, biologists, astronomers and other minds — catch glimpses, <sup>J </sup>and in which normal life will be never-ending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions now living who are meek and at j heart longing for righteousness will pass 1 through the present time of trouble and enter the new physical condition, now developing, by ; which normal human life will be prolonged nearly a thousand years and will enter the next i great physical change in earth conditions, when j normal human life will be never-ending life. | Hence, “millions now living will never die”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THE bold command of the county health (f) officer that all school children must be vaccinated or be excluded from the schools surely smells of despotism plus. But the good doctor has discovered the presence of smallpox &quot;in many separate and distinct localities”, and we are advised &quot;to take safeguard measures”, etc. But first, Doctor, we want you doctors to agree among yourselves as to the efficacy of vaccination. Now, as it stands, the best half of the medical profession denounce vaccination, not only as being useless as a specific for the prevention of smallpox, but because it propagates various other diseases, such syphilis, tuberculosis, cancer, erysipelas, and many other loathsome and incurable disorders. The following statements of some of the world’s foremost physicians may be of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. W. J. Collins, for twelve years vaccine physician in Edinburgh and London, writes: &quot;If I had the desire to describe one-third of the victims ruined by vaccination, the blood would stand still in your veins”. Dr. Stowell, with still larger experience, declares: “Vaccination is not only an illusion but a downright curse to humanity”. Dr. Hitchman, of Liverpool, says: &quot;I have seen hundreds of children killed by vaccination”. Dr. Bicord, a distinguished French physician, admits that syphilis is often transmitted by Vaccination. Dr. Edward Pallard, medical inspector of the government board m England, published a pamphlet in which he confessed “that of forty-six children vaccinated by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">, thirty-nine became afflicted with syphilis”. Dr. J. A. Hensel, a German army surgeon in an address at Salt Lake City said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I was on duty in Strassburg when over two thousand cases of smallpox were in the pest-house, and every one of them successfully vaccinated but three months^tefore. I was laid up for five weeks, though vaccinated the seventh time. In 1898 I witnessed the amputation of three arms and the discharge of four men from the army for general debility, all from vaccination. After this experience, I am convinced that vaccination^ ia npt protective.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Other t^Jling testimony from Germany is not lacking. Dr. Alexander Wilder, editor of the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical Times</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> and professor of physiology of the U. S. Medical college of New York, says: _________ _________ ..</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Vaccination is the infusion of a contaminating ele- .3 ment into the system, and after such contamination\ou</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">can never hope to regain the former purity &lt;rf your</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">blood. Thus tainted, the body is made liable to a bort . ’./.v of ailments; all cases of consumption may be as unequiv- * ocally traced to vaccination as effects follow causes*** -</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Does vaccination afford any protection at all f <sup>;</sup> j Dr. Creighton: &quot;In my opinion it affords none -at all.” Dr. Giel: “The smallpox epidemic in Marseilles commenced with a young man with 4 deep vaccination scars on both arms.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What does vaccination dot Dr. Pigeon: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Vaccination is liable to produce smallpox; it pro-disposes to this disease and renders it more serious. Vaccination predisposes to typhoid fever, diphtheria meningitis, etc., and is a powerful factor in the debility and degeneration of the h</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should vaccination be opposed 1 Dr. -J. W. Hodge, Niagara Falls, N. Y.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Because under whatever pretext performed the implantation of disease elements into the healthy is' irrational and injurious. It is subversive of the funds-., mental principles of sanitary science.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease among cattle in New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Maryland has been investigated by the agricultural department at Washington; and its cause has been traced to calves that had been used for vaccine purposes by some of the wealthy serum companies. And this is the stuff that the medical trust grafters want to contaminate the school children with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">And now for the legal status of compulsory vaccination. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Eagle,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Estero, Fla., refers the vaccine doctors to the words of Blackstone, the founder of all modern legal lore. His statement is so completely against these vaccine poisoners, as to leave them not one legal leg to stand on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“No laws are binding,” says Blackstone, “which sa-mult the body or violate the conscience. Both the life and limbs of a human being are of such value tn the estimation of the law, that it pardons even homicide , if committed in their defense.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The supreme court of Illinois has ruled that &quot;a healthy child is not a menace in any community or school”. No school board or board of <sub>t </sub>education has the constitutional right to dray your children an education even if you do not subscribe to the biggest fraud ever perpetrated in the name of sdenoe.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Doctor Favors Vaccination </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By “Doctor*</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE foregoing letter regarding vaccination has done immeasurable harm. There was much truth in the letter, and much error. As to the position of the health officer in declaring that one “must” be vaccinated I have no defense . to offer. The great American freeman does not like to be compelled—and he will not be compelled. But as to the efficacy of vaccination for smallpox and of its harmlessness there can be absolutely no doubt. It is one of the few proved facts with which the medical profession is acquainted. Unlike the treatment for nearly all . other diseases, vaccination for smallpox has remained practically unchanged throughout all the years since it was discovered; At the present moment I can recall no other treatment for disease that has not been radically changed during the last half century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the efficacy of vaccination Sajous* “Analytic Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine”, which <sub>t</sub>\ may be regarded as the latest word on this and other subjects relating to disease and their treatment, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;As may readily be ascertained in any smallpox hospital, recently vaccinated persons, including children, can live in such an institution, wait on the patients therein, breathe its contagion-laden air,' and totally escape the disease. As recalled by Gay recently (Boston</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical and Surgical Journal,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> April 6, 1916), anaB* pox caused, before the discovery of vaccination by Dr. William Jenner, a tenth of the deaths in ordinary times, one-half in epidemics, and destroyed, maimed or &lt;Hs-figured one-fourth of mankind. The evidence that vas-cination practically prevents smallpox st the present time is overwhelming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Countries that are most efficiently vaccinated Buffer least from the scourge. To give but a few examples, Germany, where vaccination is obligatory, has been free from the disease for more than forty years, while the adjacent nations are never free. Systematic vaccination by the surgeons of the United States army in six provinces of the Philippines, having an approximate popiH lation of 1,000,000 reduced the annuak smallpox mortality from 6,000 to nothing. During the succeeding' -five yean thete was not a death from this disease in this region of a vaccinated person. In 1885 smallpox broke out in Montreal; the upper classes protected themselves by vaccination and escaped; the ignorant classes-refused and 3,000 perished. If any event in human affairs has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt it is the great benefit to be derived from timely, efficient, skillful vaccination against smallpox.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let me say that I have no interest whatever in controversy, only a desire to set right any whose preconceived ideas are against vaccination or whose minds may have been led from ths path of truth by the letter of the opponent. •</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>A Second Protest</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE foregoing letter in criticism of my article on The Vaccination Infamy is novel and interesting. Though a letter not identified by its author indicates, usually, an unsound premise, fis apparent sincerity of purpose and wellmeaning urges in me some comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine” referred^, as having the “latest word” on vaccination, is novel, in view of the fact that we have the history of vaccination since its discovery and introduction in 1798. Here we have some statistics from England, where its discovery originated and are merely records of cold, plaintfacts. Vaccination was made compulsory in 1853; smallpox deaths the first ten years of enforced vaccination (1854 to 1863) 83£15. Smallpox deaths the second ten years •f enforced vaccination (1864 to 1873) 70,458,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By A. M. Wilton, M. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">increase of smallpox in the same period, 120 percent,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The London </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lancet</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> has been frank enough to comment that &quot;in view of the facts the opposition to vaccination is not surprising&quot;. In its columns are reported from year to year do-tailed accounts of various cases among the vao- । cinated, and it was in this authoritative publication, July 15, 1874, that 122,000 vaccinated ■ persons were recorded attacked by the epidemic j in England and Wales, with 10,000 deaths. Be- 1 ports of facts like these, ghastly and undesir- j able, and announced by a voice as impressive j as that of the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica”, have 1 so influenced popular sentiment in England ; that compulsory vaccination was repealed, and | has been for about thirty years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The statistics of Germany have been called ' I upon to support the theory of vaccination, yet Dr. Kalb, the royal examiner of statistics for Bavaria writes: “A closer examination of the figures left no shadow of doubt that the so-sailed proof [favoring vaccination] was a complete failure”. In Bavaria, these were the facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In a single year 3,994 vaccinated died of smallpox. The total number attacked by the disease and who had been vaccinated exceeded 29,000. This, it was pointed out, was a liability of 400 percent greater than that of the unvaccinated person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In Prussia, with compulsion rigidly enforced, the death rate for 1852 was four times that of England. In 1871-2, 124,948 of the population died of smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">'Tn the Franco-Prussian war, the German soldiers, all, besides being vaccinated in childhood, had been revaccinated. In the recruiting depot thousands had been vaccinated twice; 53,288 able bodied men, their systems ' saturated with cow-pox lymph, were attacked by an epidemic of smallpox which proved nearly as destructive as a cholera invasion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Vaccination,” says Siljestrom, an educator whose studies in politics, economics, have placed him as an expert at the head of the admirable school system of Sweden, “impairs the defensive strength of nations. The latest medical official statistics in support of the doctrine of vaccination are completely worthless and irrelevant and the evil done for the last seventy-six yean can never be completely undone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Is vaccipe virus a syphilitic virus? I will quote Dr. Chauven, in his notable address before the French Academy of Medicine, October, 1891, after detailing his elaborate experiments which had continued for years, concludes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;(1) Vaccine virus never gives smallpox to man;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Varioloid virus never gives vaccinia to the cow;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(8) Vaccinia is, in all probability, a modified form of syphilis, as has been clearly pointed out by Dr. Charles Creighton of London, and Dr. E. M. Crookshank, profeasor of pathology and bacteriology in Kings College, London, two of the highest living authoritiee on these subjects.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Charles Creighton, who was employed to write the article on vaccination in the ninth edition of the “Encyclopedia Britannica”, because he was considered the ablest living authority on that subject, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The real affinity of cowpox is not to .smallpox, but to the greatpox. The vaccinal reseda is not only very much like the syphilitic reseda but it means the sama sort of thing. The vaccinal ulcer of every-day practice is, to all intents and purposes, a chancre; it is apt to bo an indurated sore when excavated under the scab; when the scab does not adhere, it often shows an unmistakable tendency to phagedena.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I now leave it to the readers, if in their judg- -ment, vaccination for smallpox is &quot;perfectly harmless” as is claimed by the man who reveal-eth not his name, and asserts that I, because I . do not believe that vaccination has any merits at all, and that it is a dangerous delusion, am “leading the readers from the path of truth”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OME people are prompted to express their final concrete opinion on an intricate scientific subject with an appallingly small fund of knowledge thereon. I know a man who will read a newspaper article on a scientific subject and feel himself sufficiently informed to argue with ttud even instruct those who have made a careful, exhaustive study of this science. Man's knowledge on most scientific subjects is very imperfect and limited; however, man has some scientific knowledge which is extremely valuable to huknanity, and it is not for those untaught in t^is line to condemn it as worthless. I am reminded of the woman who objected strenuously at accepting any advice from a young physician. “That young upstart of a doctor can't tell me anything about raising children: me having had ten of them, and at my age having buried seven of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age is kind enough to open its columns to the people; and it would seem that the people would be kind enough in return, to investigate a subject carefully and exhaustively before presenting it, that the public may feel, of all publications there is at least one unbiased and perfectly reliable, that being The Golden Age. Its columns should not be used by prejudiced or self-seeking individuals, for the advancement of medical cults or schools, nor for condemning procedures, appliances or articles of which they know little or nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I look upon the article on “Antitoxins and Vaccines” in the July 20th Golden Age as a bombastic assault against a most valuable sei-entific therapeutic weapon for the overcoming of certain diseased conditions: and I am very, very sorry that the minds of The Golden Age readers have been poisoned by such an article. The author, calling attention to the fact that we are entering a new age, evidently takes it for granted that whatsoever i s produced and brought forth at this time is of the new age, and therefore t o supplant our present day knowledge; referring to some of the numerous new medical cults springing up throughout the country as &quot;schools of natural healing”. God set in motion forces which produce replacement, repair and mending of human tissue; and this is the natural healing process that takes place. Nobody can produce natural or unnatural healing; for it is as one scientist remarked, “I cleanse and God heals”. There can be no natural way of treating disease; for disease is an unnatural process and is soon to be done away with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The attack on antitoxins and vaccines is obviously ridiculous. The first statement of the second paragraph is untrue and has no foundation: the statement regarding diphtheria following the introduction of vaccines. Diphtheria was known to Aretans and Galen, and epidemics reported in Europe during the middle ages. Smallpox vaccine was not introduced into Europe until the eighteenth century, and the first report of vaccination was made by Jesty, a Dorsetshire farmer, on his wife and two sons in 1774. Diphtheria antitoxin was first used in 1894. These facts were reported in the works of Osler, Forcheimer and De Sajous. So diphtheria was prevalent long before any antitoxins or vaccines were used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>n</sub> The “History of a Case” proves little or nothing; and mdny such isolated instances reported are mere happenstances, and could he found in connection with any form of treatment. Diph-theria-could have been carried, as it often is to the country home, on books, clothes, playthings, and other baggage, or even upon food. We do not know the circumstances under which certain member^ contracted tuberculosis; we do not know how sahitary were the surroundings; and if the cancer was produced by a vaccine, we would be very glad to know it, as we have been hunting the cause of cancer since the practice of medicine became recognized as a science.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark25"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">True scholars of the practice of medicine would never think of condemning a valuable proven form of treatment upon the testimony of one</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark26"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">case or even on a dozen cases. Many of the</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark27"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">so-called new schools of healing condemn vac-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">cines and antitoxins, not through experience</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark29"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">but, as the use of these does not agree witlj</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark30"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">their theory of practice, they must of necessity</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark31"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">condemn them through prejudice. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. •</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark32"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Real medical scientists would be interested only in the quotation of cases and statistics . i when a sufficient number were cited that they</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark33"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">could feel the element of chance had no place</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">therein. Now let me quote some reliable statis- \ tics which should aid one in deciding the value .... of diphtheria antitoxin and smallpox vaccine.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark34"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Tn hospital practice the mortality from diphtheria was formerly from 30 to 50 percent. In the Boston.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark35"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">City </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hospital the death rate between 1888</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 1894 was</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark36"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">only once below 40 percent, and in 1892 and 1893 rose</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark37"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to nearly 50 percent. Following the introduction of</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Previous to 1894, when antitoxin was first employed, the mortality from diphtheria in all the Paris hospitals for children averaged 50 percent.

The first before the use of antitoxin, and the second those treated with antitoxin.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Now for a few on smallpox vaccination:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In unprotected persons smallpox is a very fatal dia-e.isc. the dvathrnte ranging from 25 to 35 percent. In William M. Welch’s report from the Municipal Hospital, Philadelphia, of 2,831 cases of variola (smallpox), 1,534, or 54.18 percent, died, while of 2,169 cases of varioloid (cases previously vaccinated) only 28, or 1.29 percent, died.”—Osler’s &quot;Practice of Medicine”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The evidence that vaccination practically prevents smallpox at the present time is overwhelming. Countries that are most efficiently vaccinated suffer least from the scourge. To give but a few examples, Germany, where vaccination is obligatory, has been free from the disease for more than 40 years, while the adjacent nations are never free. Systematic vaccination by the surgeons of the United States army in 6 provinces of the Philippines, having an approximate population of one million, reduced the annual smallpox mortality from 6,000 to nothing. During the succeeding 5 years there was not a death from this disease in this region of a vaccinated person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In 1885, smallpox broke out in Montreal; the upper classes protected themselves by vaccination and escaped; the ignorant classes refused and 3,000 perished.”—Sa-Jous’s &quot;Analytic Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Some explanation of these figures is necessary that they may be fully appreciated. The great reduction in file death rate is seen only in those cities and countries where serum treatment has been widely employed. Nowhere in Europe is this true to the same degree as in Paris, Berlin and Germany generally; and probably nowhere in Europe has it been so little used and so slow in gaining favor as in London.”—Holt’s “Infancy and Childhood&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To tenure vaccines and antitoxic serums, in ‘heir early days, did carry impurities and produced diseased conditions in the persons inoculated ; but modern methods and technique have perfected the process of production, so that those turned out now are free from impurities; and if infections are introduced with them it is due to lack of proper care and cleanliness on the part of the physician administering them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We often hear that diphtheritic paralysis is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">produced by the use of diphtheria antitoxin. It . is a fact that there are more cases of diphtheritic paralysis than before its use; but that is to be expected, for the reduction in mortality is ' responsible for this fact. Many paralyzed cases j. would have gone into the grave if it had not . been for the use of the antitoxin; and as most cases of diphtheritic paralysis recover com- ' pletely, we are all glad to know that they may <sub>v </sub>be saved to remain on earth a while and per- _ &nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">haps be of the “millions now living that will -never die”. Also, if we will search back into -medical history, we shall find that diphtheritic paralysis was recognized and known long before ' antitoxins were discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tuberculosis and cancer are everywhere prevalent and have claimed their victims by the millions for centuries, long before vaccines and antitoxins were discovered; and one who is logical would hestitate to condemn these forms of treatment because cases can be reported here ’' and there in which these diseases attacked the individuals inoculated, for it is easy to find exactly as many with these diseases who have &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">not been inoculated. How should we look upon - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the attack on cancer and tuberculosis research? We appreciate that a small amount of benefit has accrued from the tuberculosis research, and little or nothing from the cancer research; but . humanity would have good reason for condemning medical scientists for cruelty and neglect of their duty if they did not prosecute a relentless and untiring search for relief and cure of these horrible pestilences which are upon mankind. The reference to the torture of animals is the old anti-vivisectionist’s cry and has been proven groundless so often that sound-minded people should in the existing light be ashamed to raise it again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">~ . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having been an innocent victim of these bligbt-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">mg inventions of the evil one, I am relating ~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my experience with the hope that it may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the means of saving some one from sufferings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">disability and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">On August 11, 1916, I suffered an attack of rheumatism, which affected my right Hmb. ' ■ 'After being treated for several weeks by the ■ local physician without any beneficial results, &gt;&nbsp;I was advised by him to resort to a certain vaccine manufactured by a wealthy company. ■ To this at first I objected; however, as time passed by without any improvement, I at last &lt;&nbsp;consented to its use, receiving in all about eleven injections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very first injection the disease took</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a turn for the worse. Within a very short time</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the limb was so painful, and the muscles in it</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">- so contracted, that it was impossible for me to straighten it out, to bear any weight on it or even to walk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This contraction of the muscles continued until January 3, 1917, when I finally had to take to bed, despite all that different doctors could do, By March 19,1917, the right limb was twisted in back of the left one, and both of ' them were flexed (drawn) rigidly up against my abdomen unmovable and untouchable. During all this time (from August 11,1916 to March 19, 1917) I suffered the anguish and agony of the “damned”. Any attempt to move the afflicted ■ ' parts or even a slight jar would cause the most excruciating pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, on March 19, 1917,1 was taken to a . hospital to have my limbs stretched and - straightened. It required three operations to straighten the limbs and to break up the adhesions in the joints. After the limbs were straight, they were fastened securely on long . splints for six weeks. At the end of six weeks the splints<sup>1</sup> were reiuoved and 8 forty-pound &quot;&nbsp;extension weight was fastened to each limb and ‘ allowed to remain there for another four weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the meantime, however, I was daily given ' three hypodermic injections of sterilised</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">(boiled) cow's milk, each injection oonsisting . of about two fluid ounces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The hypodermic needle was about as thick - . as the lead in a leadpencil, and was injected <sub>(</sub> i about half an inch under the skin. After both * -arms became too sore and swollen, the milk ■ was injected into both thighs and groins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">These injections were kept up for about eight • weeks, at the end of which time I was more dead than alive. Both legs were badly swollen and with the forty pounds of iron extension weights continually pulling on the sore,’ inflamed joints, the agony and suffering that I endured is indescribable. I honestly believe I would have died had I not been removed, by my request, from the institution. To add to my sufferings the injections so poisoned my system that I became one raw open sore, from the top of my head to the soles of my feet, making it necessary to call in a physician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">On August 29, 1917, I entered another hospital, where I remained for nine months, till May 20, 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">While a patient in this hospital I was again treated (f) with two different kinds of vaccines, but with disastrous results, one a nerve vaccine,' the other a rheumatic vaccine, both manufao- ' tured by another wealthy concern. The “nerve&quot; vaccine, to which injection I was forced to submit or be expelled from the hospital in midwinter, with below zero weather and snow several feet deep on the ground, caused the muscles in my toes to contract, drawing them against the soles of my feet and dislocating ’ several joints. If I were able to stand on my feet today I would be standing on the nails of my toes instead of the lower part of the toes resting on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">When at first I had refused to submit to the “nerve” vaccine injections the doctor flew into a rage and ordered me expelled from the hospital ; and only by submitting to the injections was I allowed to remain. The distance from the hospital to my home was about eight miles over -rural roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I am now twenty-one years of age and have spent the last four and one-half years in bed. As there is no hope for me on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> earth, I am compelled to spend the rest of my’days in bed. Gone are the best days of my Kfe; gone are tile <sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">joys and pleasures; gone is my usefulness, sentenced to a life of suffering and invalidism, to loneliness and misery, all as the result of the doctors' ignorance, deception and Satanic lusts •nd desires—fame, riches, prominence, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh, would that the day were here when all mankind will follow the &quot;golden rule” and destroy forever the deceptive works and wiles of Satan!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I hope that you will keep up the good and f noble work that you have so valiantly begun, ' ■ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and that God will guide you and be with you . ‘ in your spreading of truth, justice and enlight-ment throughout the whole world, until the “appointed time” of the Great Redeemer has come. . I also hope that this letter may be the means of saving some future victim from </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> “living i death” from injections of vaccine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Against Vaccination</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A FEW words concerning vaccines and serums, what they do and do not do, based on statistics in my files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The practice with Government sanction of vaccination and serum treatment has been going on for a long while; indeed, at times under enforcement. It is hoped this will not continue long; for Vaccination has never prevented smallpox any more than serum injection has prevented typhoid, though a well-equipped and financed board of propagandists state to the contrary. The decrease in these diseases is due to better hygiene and sanitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Vaccination commenced many years ago, those most influential in its earlier stages being Jenner and Lady Montague. The theory seemed to be that, as cows having a disease known as oowpox, exhibited symptoms resembling smallpox, the scabs of these afflicted cows might be gotten into the blood of humans through a cut or abrasion, rendering the system thereafter immune from smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Records of those days show that people sickened and died as usual, but there were few diseases and these well recognized. However, since vaccination began, the types of diseases have increased in number and complexity to such an extent as to warrant the assertion that many ef these new forms of disease spring from the vaccination error. The strong ground on which this contention rests is, that the so-called cowpox from which came the earlier virus, was syphilis contracted by the cow from the hand of its milker, previously so afflicted; and that hence in passing the scabs of this scourge into the human’system, it simply means the one so treated has been inoculated with syphilis and will throughout life’s duration manifest symptoms of this disease, eventually perhaps dying</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By W. M. Pugh</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">from the so-called smallpox preventive treatment. Even supposing smallpox were prevented by vaccination, the future ills begotten by the practice far outweigh possible immunization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We have now stated that smallpox is not prevented by vaccination, also that syphilitic taint is implanted at the time of the action of the physician. What proofs are to be exhibited to back up these strong statements against a medical error! A few will be directly given and reference made to a number so great and of such a character as to leave no doubt in the minds of any reasonable person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A gentleman once well known, Mr. John Pitcairn, of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, presented some facts in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ladies Home Journal</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of May and June, 1910, that have never been contradicted or disproved. For instance the early occupying army of the United States in the Philippines, a most thoroughly vaccinated organization of picked men and officers, showed a smallpox outbreak beginning soon after arrival and continuing until no less than 737 cases were acknowledged by the chief surgeon, with some 261 deaths—a rather heavy rate for supposedly immunized men, many having been vac-&quot; cinated twice or more within fifteen months. To make the case look worse in this report of Chief Surgeon Lippincott, U.S.A., he refers to the fine enforcement of his vaccination crusade, -with the able backing of resident General Otis, who at the time insisted that all soldiers under his command submit to the surgeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. J. M. Hodge of Niagara Falls, N.¥., published in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Twentieth Century</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> magazine of September, 1910, a long article giving complete statistics of the failure of vaccination 9s a protective in Japan; further showing that country to be the most vaccinated territory in the world,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">with a rating of some 97 percent vaccinated and over 70 percent revaccinated. Yet Japan had T several outbreaks of smallpox in epidemic form <sup>e)</sup>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.with a heavy percent of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also we have the case of Prof. Buata, of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Perugia, Italy. In the spring of 1912 he was &quot;■J summoned before a high trial board of the &lt;&nbsp;Italian Government charged with refusal to ' .vaccinate and of inciting the public to rebel at the practice of error. The Professor drew the . trial board into a tangle by having them </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">admi</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">t that if he proved his declarations against vac-eination, they would free him. After many days he did so and was freed, and commended for showing up the outrageous error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">All this testimony is on file and ready at short notice for exhibition. It is voluminous and com-pletw in that it proves that vaccination does not immunize, and shows its horrible source, with . numerous statements showing the many afflictions upon those vaccinated, their later suffer. ings and often death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">, If what has been written is true, why is vac* ’ cination persisted in and at times under gov-eminent compulsion! A period comes where reason must be brought into play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It was shown that before vaccination the types of disease were few and well-known; that now they are many and kept in the dark, behind hospital walls, when possible. These ills followed the vaccination error: and by the lay-• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man the prominent ones are called consumption,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">eczema, cancer, infantile paralysis, secondary’ syphilis and the drying of the mother’s breast so that she may no longer nourish her off spring. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other diseases there are, but enough have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">named. Watch, for instance, when orders are <sub>w</sub> /■ given for vaccinating the public, how soon thereafter an epidemic of measles follows. As - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as there is vaccination there will be fre</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">quent disease afflictions handed out to the human family, calling for treatment and for pay-</span></p>

With improved sanitation and better health-habits of nations, the treatment by -drugs was fast passing; something had to be T, done; hence compulsory vaccination. This would enforce illness on those born to reasonable *</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">health and make them patients for Big Busi- • ness, furnishing and selling drugs at big profit. It is another case of Big Business summoning the people to the block, filching theirpocket-books, leaving them, if not sick, at least but \ slightly well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Is there a remedy! First the population must be educated to the fallacy of the claims of 1 cination and the train of ills it thereafter eon-fers; then organized petition to the United States Government to allow vaccination to those <sub>; </sub>foolish enough to desire it but forever to probibit its practice upon those denying its preposterous claims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Then, too, we may have confidence in the good ‘ times coming, when God says : “I will overturn, overturn, overturn&quot;. Of all the things in a pre*-ent upside condition that need to be overturned and made right, none deserves earlier reepg-nition than this error of vaccination, fathered as it is by the same organization that puts chloride of lime into drinking water. These alto &gt;&nbsp;give serum inoculation to prevent typhoid. Then ; when the patients have typhoid, they call it $ para-typhoid and search for a new serum. j</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Listen to these words from one of the great ! European savants, Prof. Chalmette of Paris, i Pasteur Institute, quoted from </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of July 31: '’Tuberculosis came with civilization; it । will stay with civilization until defeated by it&quot;. ; Again* he says: &quot;Savage races are immune from ' this scourge”, but gives no reason. Let him look and he will see that the ignorant savage has too much sense to be vaccinated and secure as a possible reward, consumption; he leaves his <sup>1 </sup>civilized, enlightened brother do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Cured by Serums By </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mrs. Mary E. Burnet</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">H El serpm treatment is rather new, so much so that I have heard some physicians object to serums as being still in the experimental stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Some eighteen months ago I wrote telling you how my three children and myself had been cured of whooping-cough and the &quot;flu”, and the baby had been cured of pneumonia, by the tise of serum alone. Our recovery was rapid and complete, with no lingering after-effects whatever. I wish to add that so far from suffering' any evil results from the use of the serum, bur</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">general health has been improved by it. We Were all disposed to take cold very easily, and no method of &quot;hardening&quot; that we tried did any good, but the serum treatment put an end to that Relieved of the colds which so constantly troubled them the children have gained rapidly in weight and in general health. For myself, life has been a long battle with ill-health, since at the age of six I suffered an attack of typhoidpneumonia. The danger of tuberculosis has been ■a ever-present shadow; but the serum not only ended the colds, but also wiped out the symptoms of incipient tuberculosis. I feel sure that X am free from it for good. Knowing its effects 1*1 my own case, I cannot agree with Mrs. Bur-toootfs view that serums and vaccines fill the Hood with poisons and disease taints. No other treatment is so rapid, so effective; none ever made me feel so thoroughly strengthened and cleansed of disease. It is a destroyer of disease germs in the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One thing I am glad to have read lately is the cure of leprosy by the use of chaulmoogra oil, specially prepared for injection by the hypodermic needle. That there should be at last a cure for that disease seemed to me a sign of the last days and of the coming of the Golden 'Age. It seems also a triumph for intravenous medication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I know that there have been serums which contained live germs of the diseases they were to fight; but. it was found that the injection of the dead germ served the same purpose of increasing the power of the blood to destroy the disease, so that these are used with better effect and no danger to the patient. Of course, &quot;&nbsp;such treatment has its limitations; but where ’ the germ causing the disease is recognized, and the substance that kills that germ is introduced into the blood, it certainly has wonderfully . quick and beneficial results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Since taking such treatment myself I have observed with interest its effect on other cases in this vicinity. I know of apparently hopeless cases- of tuberculosis cured by its use, while others who took the rest-cure, and had the best of food and care, went on to death. One case of erysipelas, so bad that the patient was at death’s door, was cured by the use of serum. That was about four years ago, and today the patient is alive and in good health. A case of typhoid fever which all expected to end fatally was cured by the same method. Another case, where an open sore, the result of infection in an artery, had been treated for nearly two years by different doctors in various ways, was cured in about six weeks by the serum treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As to the sore on the arm caused by vaccination for smallpox — the doctor who handled these cases and many hundreds of others successfully, tells me that the sore comes not from within the body but is caused by infection from the outside and can be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Like Mrs. Bnrzacott, I think that we should strive to safeguard our health through right ways of living and proper diet, but as Long as other people refuse to do the same we shall be exposed to infections which we cannot always resist. I am sure I am glad to have the assistance of the physicians who use the serum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">V</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCINE therapy, fortunately, has demonstrated its value. Typhoid fever in the army'is practically a thing of the past, as a result of^anti-typhoid inoculations. The value of vaccination against smallpox was clearly shown in stamping out epidemics in the Philippines after the United States took control there and vaccinated, everybody. The United States Public Health Service can probably give you the figures. ‘Look up the smallpox statistics of ■ the Austrian army before and after vaccination. That infections (pus infections) occur cannot be gainsaid. They occur daily from other and less useful scratches. One individual in a million has a very sore arm. Why should this fact be played up and the wonderful value to the other thousands be overlooked?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The article in question did not appear to me to be moderate in opinion or statement. Certainly it was contrary to fact. The idea of smallpox being an opportunity for the system to rid itself of impurities! I cannot bring myself to believe that you subscribe to any such theory. The Golden Age has been unfortunate in its medical material. I grant the medical profes*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bion lacks accurate knowledge of many things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">_ But then I have written you this before. When one of your writers solemnly states that typhus fever is carried by air particles, breathing; and <sup>1</sup> the profession at large know, and have known for several years, that typhus is transmitted by lice; doctors and their wives are likely to have a generally poor opinion of The Golden Age. That statement about typhus was made by you some months ago.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Vaccination a Failure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Mrs. R. Walter Maygrove</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N A recent issue of your most valuable paper, The Golden Age, for April 27th of the current year was an article by G. del Pino, of Glasgow, entitled, “How Vaccines Work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Vaccination never prevented anything and never will, and is the most barbarous practice of an otherwise civilized nation. When will men learn as much about their own bodies as they do about their motor cars!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The medical world points with pride at the great decrease in smallpox and proudly gives corpse virus the credit when sanitation is the real benefactor. We are told that the vaccines used by the physicians are prepared under the <sub>x</sub> most sanitary conditions. The conditions as *' one has put it are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The torturing of calves until in some well-known cases the eyes of the animals have dropped from their sockets from the agony they have endured. Then the corpse virus is about ready to be injected into the blood of some baby or some elder with, let us say, softening of the brain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is bad enough to teach that a body is rendered more immune from disease by being poisoned ; but to make laws forcing parents to have their perfectly well babies vaccinated, subjecting them to cadaveric poisoning before they may be allowed the privileges of a common school education, is a most shameful outrage upon a free (!) people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">- Jenner in 1789 w’as the first to inoculate the virus into human beings in order to stimulate immunity from smallpox; and later every one of hi^own family died of tuberculosis, martyrs to a fodlish cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Makuna wrote 4,000 physicians of England, asking them the effects of vaccination. Only 375 replied and the doctors admitted to 126 easei of ^erysipelas, 64 eczema, 53 syphilis, 8 scrofula, and a liberal number of cases of cancer, boils, blindness, paralysis, and meningitis, along with diseased bones and other serious ailments. This is probably only a very </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mall</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> percentage of the danger done by vaccines in the hands of these 4,000 doctors, as only a few physicians had the courage to speak truthfully and the cases cited were only such as follow immediately after vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The editor of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Homeopathic World</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is exceedingly dangerous to vaccinate persona with cancerous growths. We have seen several ?ues in which cancer has blazed up immediately after vaccination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical Talk</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> plainly says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In our judgment vaccination does not protect from smallpox but on the contrary weakens the system and renders the patient more likely to take smallpox” “If the physicians would call things by their right names, vaccination would soon go out of practice. A vaccination sore is a poison sore, and the constitutional symptom is septic fever. Even those who recover from the acute symptoms cannot be sure that they are done with the matter, as a portion of the virus may remain in the system. The damage done may lurk in the system for years, then break out in full fury.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Porter F. Cope, Secretary of &quot;The AntiVaccine Society” said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Vaccination induces diphtheria in infants and tuberculosis after puberty. Vaccine has been proven to ba the direct cause of pneumonia, pleurisy, and lockjaw.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the late war 70,000 British soldiers were sent home suffering with tuberculosis after being inoculated with the virus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I cannot picture the heavenly Father torturing a poor helpless calf, taking the pus from a vile, stinking sore on its belly and giving it to a child, saying, “Here is life&quot;. We are in the last days; and the devil is slowly losing his hold, making a strenuous effort meanwhile to do all the damage he can, and to his credit can such evils be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I appeal to all right thinking people to throw off this veil of ignorance and fight for their lives and those of their little ones. Do you know, fathers and mothers, that 70 percent of the children born in the United States are either morons, anemic or syphilitic! Use youy rights as American citizens to forever abolish the devilish practice of vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Prenatal Influence </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Compiled by F. Leon Scheerer</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TTOW few recognize the saeredness of paren-tai responsibilities. “Parentage is undoubtedly the highest and most important function of human life. Yet how few realize the sacredness of parental responsibilities t The Prophet inquires, ‘Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean T ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;While admiting that none of our race is perfect we must admit also that in the parents reside great possibilities respecting the good or evil of their children. This responsibility should be considered before marriage. This does not mean that marriage should be put upon the same plane as stockbreeding, and the finer sentiments disregarded, but that the spirit of a sound mind should be [used to determine] not only the destiny and happiness of the pair, but also of their offspring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Would that we could impress this thought upon all who become parents that their children should be devoted to Jehovah from the moment of conception! and daily meditation and effort be made that prenatal influences might all conduce to the highest mental, moral and physical welfare of their offspring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;No other contract or arrangement pertaining to the things of this present life is so important as the marriage contract; yet people of fairly well-balanced minds seem to treat it as a sort of lottery to be guided by chance instead of by reason; and what is more they regard God as the Creator of each individual member of the human race — failing to discern that He endowed our first parents with procreative powers which have descended to their offspring, and that the human species represents the highest type of animal creation, and like the rest has been endowed by the Creator with the power of producing each after its own kind.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C.T. Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Beagarehes in human Embryology [the study of the child from conception until birth] have brought out the interesting and significant fact that the number of pyramidal cells in the cortex of the cerebral brain goes on increasing until the third<sup>1</sup> or fourth month of foetal life. Beyond this period the number does not change. This means that the number of cortical cells of this type with which any given individual is endowed is fixed well before birth. Hence, we may say, that, here, as in the case of the animal ' 7-creation, it is the number and condition of growth of the pyramidal neurones which deter- &gt;&nbsp;mines the status of mental capability.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Further light upon the relations of the pyra- ’ midal neurones to intelligence has been shed by -the study of the brains of the idiotic, imbecile . and feeble-minded. It has been shown that the' pyramidal neurones of idiots are poorly formed, . undersized and, more important still, possess <sub>; </sub>very few fibres. In extreme cases no fibres at all were present. This means that correlations, unions, assemblages of ideas, memories, sensations, etc., are impossible where there exist no physical connections between the multitudinous • pyramidal neurones. Furthermore it might be said that it is this inability of feeble-minded parents to transmit to their offspring anything but imperfect intellectual equipment which in no slight measure is menacing many of our urban communities, as well as filling our asy-^ lums and jails with the criminally insane to be harbored at state expense.” — </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prof. Leon H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hausman, Ph. D., in Hearst's Magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The fact that the number of pyramidal neurones is fixed before birth has an immense , j sociological significance, which is often a tragic one!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The breeder of fine horses, dogs, cattle, etc., will explain how careful he is with the mother ’ during the period of breeding—her health, her surroundings, all are considered, because all have to do with her offspring, yet these same breeders of cattle, horses, poultry, eta, seem to give little consideration to the wife, the mother of their own children, during the period of gestation. How strange that a horse fancier realizes that the breeding mare will be benefited by pio-tures of winning horses and, seeing horses racing, and that as a consequence her foal will bo more speedy and more valuable, yet fails to apply thus principle to his wife.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hr. Bellows.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> A</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Whoever will acquaint himself with the caro exercised by the scientific florist and gardener for the obtaining of choice varieties of fruits, i flowers, and vegetables, will have reason to feci ashamed of the little attention that is paid to the attainment of proper ideals in respect to the human race—indeed it is amazing that with</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the majority there is no ideal whatever; blind, brute passion alone is recognized. Hope for the world would die were it not based upon the sure .Word of God, which promises mankind help from on high in the great kingdom of Messiah.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—C. T. Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“We have excellent practical treatises on agriculture and horticulture, and every intel-Mgent farmer or gardener may learn what ele-&lt; ment is deficient, in order successfully to cultivate his grapes, his vegetables or his grains; having also chemical analysis of the fruits and grains, and of the materials froril which to obtain his deficient elements he has the means of adapting his soil to all desirable productions. We have also treatises on raising horses, cattle, hens, pigs, fishes and even bees and canary birds, but not a single practical treatise on raising children. And so perfectly ignorant are people generally of the laws of nature, that they give their pigs the food which their children need to develop muscle and brain, and give the children what their pigs need to develop fat, etc.” —</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dr. Bellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The unsoundness of the human mind is further illustrated in the matter of the reckless propagation of the human race. It progresses almost without regard to the laws of health, and almost without provision for the proper sustenance of the offspring, and in utter violation of the laws of nature, recognized in the breeding of the lower animals, cattle, sheep, horses and dogs.”—C. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">T. Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Deficiency disease” is a phrase used to describe many disorders due to an inadequate diet, to quote Dr. H. W. Wiley: &quot;As I.have studied </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> problem throughout the whole of my active life I have been more and more convinced of . die fact that a great deal more than 50 percent of all the ailments from which human beings suffer are caused directly or indirectly by the character of the diet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DIET AND DISEASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The prime factor of a healthy body resolves itself into a question of a strong, healthy blood. (The bloodSis the life.—Deuteronomy 12:23) It is a recognized scientific fact that a sluggish, impoverished circulation leads up to almost all human ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor food, that has been robbed of the essential mineral salts, cannot be expected to make rich, pure blood. Factories preparing foodstuffs, and flour mills are eliminating, as nearly as possible, it seems, every particle of iron, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, silica, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, etc., from our food staples; and die products containing the mineral salts that are essential to the energizing and immunizing of the human system are mostly sold as feed for domestic animals. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The body being deprived of these essential mineral salts is unable properly to assimilate the food we eat, and as a consequence there is a growing inability of the system to eliminate the poisons causing a sluggish circulation. When the body manifests disease in any form the manifestation is caused by reason of lack of assimilation of the required organic salts that feed the human system; and the consequent lack of elimination of the poisons from the body through the kidneys, liver, bowels, and the pores of the skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is not necessary that each meal contain some of all the types of mineral salts, but it is necessary that a certain of each kind of food be eaten regularly at different meals in order to maintain a nutritional balance, because each kind of tissue needs its regular allowance of those food elements necessary for its nourishment. The daily diet should be composed of food that, considered as a whole, will contain some of all the elements that the different body tissues are composed of. Body tissues differ in their chemical composition. So in order to sustain the different tissues properly, the food selections must be based upon the question of: ‘Does this meal contain food that, properly digested, will make available some or all the elements the body tissues are composed off’”— </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dr. H. Dugan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOME FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Involuntarily we resent new ideas because resenting things is about the very easiest thing we can do. It requires a distinct and voluntary effort to accept and organize into one's philosophy a new idea. Chiefly because of this impediment, this intellectual inertia, we do not easily learn to relate facts. Therefore, the great majority resent and pooh pooh the idea that diminution in the basic content of our foods can possibly be a factor in arrested development, weakmindedness, general racial deterioration</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or other human ills.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Albert 8. Gray, M. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">And so in the case of a prospective mother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Deficiency of diet undermines her state of health at a time when she is called upon more vitally than ever before, not only for herself ■ but for her unborn child. Deficiency disease not only attacks the unborn child of the poorly nourished mother, but it attacks the mother herself. She is robbed of the ability to bring forth a healthy disease-resisting child, and is also robbed of the ability to keep her own tissues and her own internal secretions in a healthy condition. She attempts to perform two duties with but half the quantity and quality of material or food necessary to do one, the growth-promoting and growth-controlling attributes of the young are lost and the mother bears her child under very unfavorable conditions.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mrs. H. Holmes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;She enters the period of lactation wholly unable to comply with nature’s provision for the child.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are a great many different types of people in the world and each of these types has a different chemical constitution and requires a different line of feeding to support their particular requirements, hence the fallacy to suppose that there is any way to feed people en masse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“A constitution is determined by its chemical and structural makeup. Generally speaking we divide the body into brain and nervous system, bones, muscles, ligaments and vital organs. If the brain and nervous system predominate we say the person is of a neurogenic constitution. If the bones predominate the person belongs to the bony or calciferic constitution. Muscles in turn determine the muscular or myogenic, and so on through a series of nineteen constitutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The body is made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, sul-phtrr, sodium, chlorine, fluorine, potassium, magnesium, iron, silicon, manganese, etc. The proportion of these elements differ in humans in a similar manner as they differ in animals, vegetables or plants.” “In each human is a controlling </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">eleme</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nt or combination of elements de-' termining the constitution. As the various animals depend on certain soils and climatic conditions, just so do the various constitutions of humans thrive better upon special food and surroundings. Thus the feeding and care of an</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">individual is placed on a practical basis. Foods can be selected that will give np their energy t and elements and can be properly utilized by i’ the individual.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J. W. Wiglesworth, D. N. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In speaking of the “Selective Function of J: Cells”, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal of Therapeutics and Die-tetics,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The doctrine of the selective action of the ‘ cells, by which, they are enabled to choose out ' : from the blood those elements which they have, need of, and appropriate them to tin supply i of their wants, while they reject all other ele- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ments, and send them along to be used by such &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">other cells as may have need of them, is one ' । which offers an easy solution of many tilings in physiology and medicine which are otherwise hard to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Stated a little more at length, the theory may be illustrated as follows: In the general &lt;&nbsp;blood-stream as it comes pouring out of the left side of the heart, and goes pulsing through the arteries to every part of the system, there is to ' be found every kind of matter which goes to make up the different tissues and structures of the body. There is oxygen to purify the blood *■ and revivify the tissues, phosphorus for the brain cells, lime and gelatin for the bones, al- ' bumen for the muscles, and the proper material for all the different kinds of cells — mucous, serous, glandular—in short, the things which are needed for every part of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Nor can the material which is intended for the nutrition of one part be made use of by any other part. Each cell claims for its own and takes unto itself that kind of material, and only that, which can be elaborated in its own factory and made up into the substances which it needs and uses in its daily life and work. Unto each part its own, and every part unto its own place, is the law of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“So through all the parts of the body this one ’ fluid goes coursing on its way, while at every station there is thrown off by the blood and taken up by the cells those particles of matter to which are needed there, and only those. There | is a selective affinity of each part for its own t material. The hair cells pick out with unfailing accuracy those substances which go to the making up of hair. The liver chooses only those materials which can be changed into sugar and bile, and the other liver materials and liver products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“In this two-fold mental activity the relative function is that of architect and builder. It is '» the function of the conscious mental life to form ideals, to discover the laws of construction, to z determine their food values, chemical affinities, $ mechanical preparation and to gauge their proper proportions. It is the function of the unconscious to carry these through the various mechanical and chemical changes incident to digestion and assimilation, to make them into <sup>7</sup>'’ bipod and to feed the cells of the body individually and as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The architect’s plans must include not only the lines of the foundation which determine largely the form and capacity of the building but also the character of the material entering into it—just as truly as the material in a house determines its appearance, utility, durability, and general value, so does the material </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> body and brain building used as food determine the texture and quality of the flesh and the beauty, strength and endurance of the body. The same is shown in animals by a test of their flesh and by their means of living. The flesh of quadrupeds and birds and fishes contain phosphorus in just the proportion to their natural activity.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Dr. Winbighler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The migrating fishes, whose acts and muscular power enable them to swim up rapids and over falls, contain more phosphates than the flounder and halibut. Quadrupeds, birds and insects instinctively select food containing phosphorus in proportion to that of which they are composed and in proportion to their activity.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Dr. Bellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In this connection, says Mrs. S. Curtiss Mott in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ladies Home Journal-.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> “If the mother can transmit through the circulating medium of the blood not only her own characteristics of mind and body, but those of her husband and * his .and her ancestors as well (It is a signifi-cant fact, that this law of ancestral heredity prevents what stirpiculturists or ‘race improv-’ ers* so ardently desire—a special breeding of a special kind of human being) is it unreasonable to ^ask .women to accept the further truth that whatever experiences make a strong impression; pleasing or the reverse on the mother, will likewise affect the child! What may seem mysterious at first is susceptible of a very natural and logical explanation of this matter. We must remember that the brain of the child is like an exceedingly sensitive or sensitized plate which is ready to record the most subtle impression very frequently as a permanent record, determining its conduct and character in the future. Whether in later* life the child is to turn out a good, normal being, with kind, healthy, generous impulses, depends largely upon the nature of these impressions, on the frequency of their repetition and the force with which they are made. That the brain of the unborn child records and later develops and reveals whatever impressions are thrown upon it through the medium of the mother’s emotions and sensations has been abundantly tested and proved, and any nervous impression which produces an alternation temporal or permanent in the blood of the mother, is directly communicated to the child. This is a demonstrated physiological fact.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking of the cerebellum, in its relation to health and disease, we read in &quot;Human Culture” by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dr. Winbighler:</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;All of the psychical faculties are located in the cerebral cortex. One set of these sensoria is located in the side of the head. Through these brain centers the soul studies business, finance, industry, food, liquids, methods of self-preservation, medication, nutrition and everything which relates to physical life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Another set of faculties is located in the temples or middle part of the head. These intelligent forces study art, music, idealism, poetry, self-beauty, and physical improvement in the arts, sciences and industries. Through these, men become aspiring and inclined for self-elevation (and improvement) in a physical sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;A third set of organs is located on the top of the head. These intelligent forces are abstract and metaphysical in themselves. They constitute the subjective mind. They are interested in religious culture, law, spiritual truths, salvation and eternal life. They study the spiritual forces of the universe. They are interested in a righteous character, righteousness, spirit [ual] life, eternal happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“A fourth set of powers is located in the forehead. They are interested in education, science, philosophy, physical matter and its qualities. They study the universe in a material sense. They are the scientists, architects, builders, designers, inventors, speakers and makers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">things. They gather and use data. They make man progressive in a technical, mechanical, inventive, scientific, literary, oratorical, reasoning and philosophical sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But in all those faculties, there is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not one </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that is able to secrete and support life or to manufacture nutrition for brain, thought, emotion or the general activities of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;When it is a question of life production, nutrition and health, the cerebrum and psychical faculties must fall back upon those brain centers </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">located in the base;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the most important of those brain centers are the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cerebellum</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">medulla oblongata.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> The medulla itself is the distributing department. It has charge of distribution of nutrition in a transportations! sense. This transportation is two fold: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">anabolic</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> or re-constructive, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">catabolic </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or eliminative. In these two processes, life and death are represented. Through the anabolic process nutrition and life are transported to such places where they are needed. Through the catabolic process, waste products, impurity and foreign elements are carried out of the system through the skin, lungs, bowels, kidneys, and other excretory organs. For that reason, health and disease depend greatly upon the medulla oblongata. But the medulla does not in itself participate in the creative process of life. The medulla is simply the power house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It is the cerebellum that is the laboratory of life, in a biochemical sense. Every one strongly developed in.the cerebellum has a long lease of life. Longevity is a result of a well-developed cerebellum and medulla. No one can expect to live long and resist diseases when he is weak in those brain sections. When these brain centers give out, the thread of life is spun.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The fidelity of the unconscious builder of the body and of character may be trusted more intelligently when we study the results produced in nature by the great principles of mimicry. Innumerable illustrations are at hand, such as the polar bear, which is white to correspond to his surroundings; the deer, which is white in ■winter and brown in summer, adjusting to the change in seasons; the tiger, which is striped, adjusted to the jungle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“A remadcable instance of this principle of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mim</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">icry is round in the case of Jacob (Genesis 30:37-39) determining the color of the next Beason’s calves by the color of the rods placed before the eyes of the cattle at the water troughs. Confidence in this power .of mimicry, to influence the constructive processes </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> body, and character building, has caused thousands of prospective mothers to surround themselves with objects of beauty; fill their minds 'with beautiful thoughts; listen to exquisite music; and kindled visioning toward high ideals with the very purpose of endowing the unborn child with gifts which he might not otherwise have.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“A very notable example along this line is furnished us in the case of the mother of Bev. Chas. Kingsley as recorded in his ’.Memories of his Life’. His mother, a remarkable woman full of poetry and enthusiasm, was born in the West Indies—keenly alive to the charms of scenery, and highly imaginative in her younger days, as she was eminently practical in mnturer life— believed that impressions made on her own mind (before the birth of this child, for whose coming she longed) by the romantic surround^ ings of her Devonshire home, would be mysteriously transmitted to him; and in this faith, and for his sake, as well as for her own, she luxuriated in the exquisite scenery of the hills, and the lovely Dart which flowed below the grounds of the little parsonage, and gave herself up to the enjoyment to every sight and sound which she hoped would be dear to her child in after life. These hopes were realized.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“We know through the admirable labors of Mr. Galton, that 'genius, which implies a wonderfully complex combination of high faculties tends to be inherited,’ and to prove this in the case of Chas. Kingsley, may not be altogether unimportant. He said himself in 1865, when writing to Mr. Galton, on ‘Hereditary Talent*, but referring to the Kingsley family:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘We are but the &quot;disjecta membra” of a most remarkable pair of parents. Our talents such as we possess are altogether hereditary. My father was a magnificent man both in body and mind, and was said to possess every talent except that of using his talents. My mother on the contrary, had a quite extraordinary practical and administrative power; and she combines with it even at her advanced age (79) my father’s passion for knowledge, and the sentiment and fancy of a young girl.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The same principle is carried into the highest realm of mental activities (spiritual mindedness) where the entire process is summed up,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in clearly perceiving the divine character. (Ps</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 16:8; 2 Corinthians 3:18) And how far reaching! Yes, it is possible to influence an embryo. Napoleon hit the nail on the head ' when he said: “The fate of a child is the work of his mother”. Only the narrow-minded and ignorant refuse a belief in prenatal influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">And as pointed out by </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dr.(Mrs.)A. Kenealy: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Born of parents of opposite qualities, men and women inherit the characteristics of both sexes. &quot;&nbsp;But in normal women female characteristics are dominant and prevent the development in them of the male characteristics inherited from their fathers. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“When these male characteristics develop, they nullify the natural womanly traits, and a ‘manish woman’ results. Again, the sons of masculine woman are emasculate, therefore, or otherwise of inferior type.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“What an important bearing the mental state and emotions of an individual have in time upon the physical body may be deduced from the following scientific facts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Raney, the celebrated horse trainer, said that aii. angry word would sometimes raise the pulse of a horse ten beats in the minute. If this is true of a beast, what can we say of its power upon humans, and upon a child yet unborn!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“There have been elaborate investigations of the emotions of rage, pain and fear and their effects upon the human tissues. This research began after the discovery that some animals and some human volunteers suffered certain stomach disorders after painful irritation. Worry, distress, rage, excitement, fear and danger also cause the muscles of the stomach and the rest of the alimentary channel to stop action. These emotions also stop the juices of digestion from flowing. Worry by causing indigestion causes real poisoning of the blood supply to the brain. This means inadequate nourishing of the brain. . . . Anything, in fact, which lowers the nutritive value of the supply of blood received by the brain, may become a sufficient cause of brain fag.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mental moods at meals are now’ recognized as having a powerful influence upon digestion. By the^ alchemy of the digestive glands the excitement of an angry and malicious mood affects the nerves so as to interfere with digestion, while cheerful, happifying influences act in the reverse manner.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">G. T. Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Photos of brain cells in men and women of *. various ages and in different conditions of health and disease have been obtained by the Nissil process and hardening and straining. .* These cells are filled with granules holding the ' <sub>: </sub>material for work and action in young and vig-,' orous persons. The examination of similar $ cells in persons who have suffered from over- . , work, nervousness and exhausting disease, show , a decreased number of granules and they appear pale and atrophied.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dr. Winbighler. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Professor Gates, for the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, D. C., in his investigation of the effects of mental states upon the body, * found that irascible, malevolent and depressing t emotions generated in the system injurious compounds, some of which were extremely poi- , sonous; he also found that agreeable, happy <sub>; </sub>emotions generated chemical compounds of nutritive .value, which stimulated the cells to manufacture energy. He says, as quoted by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">:‘Bad and unpleasant feel- <sup>! </sup>ings create harmful chemical products in the body, which are physically injurious. Good, ? pleasant, benevolent feelings create beneficial j chemical products which are physically healthful. These products may be detected by chemical analysis in the perspiration and secretions ; of the individual.’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“From all this we get the great fact we are scientifically demonstrating today, that the va- । rious mental states, emotions and passions have their various peculiar effects upon the body, and each induces in turn, if indulged in to any great extent, its own peculiar forms'of disease and these in time become chronic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Is, it any wonder that children are born nervous and peevish when we know that the mother in bearing them was fretted and annoyed in a thousand ways! Is it any wonder that children are born to a heritage of passion, anger and lust when we think of the experiences of their mother which are thus impressed npon them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Surely all parents of reasonable judgment understanding these matters, would lay proper foundation for character in their children, foundation upon which, subsequently, they would patiently, carefully and lovingly develop ' their children along the lines of the highest standards of righteousness, beauty of holiness and loyalty to the Creator!&quot;—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Man but a Very Recent Arrival </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By 0. L. Rosenkranz, Jr.</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS customary nowadays to refer to almost prehistoric times as if the earth were then already heavily populated. But a little sober reflection must convince anyone that dense populations can exist only where civilization insures the extensive practice of agriculture, and where settled, orderly conditions make life and property reasonably secure. And at the dawn of history it is well known that civilization was confined to a few restricted areas of the earth’s surface, outside of which were barren wastes, pathless forests, semi-arid steppes, and sodden marshes—wild regions, incapable of supplying an alimentary basis for more than a scanty population, until reclaimed by human artifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet from reading history we gain the impression that ancient civilization was environed by countless hordes of barbarians, perpetually eager for a chance to pounce down upon the settled regions and overwhelm them by sheer weight of numbers. But how could the scattered clearings of Germania, among woods and &gt;wamps, or the high, dry grass-lands of Scythia furnish subsistence for such teeming multitudes? Today seventy percent of the earth’s jtopulation is found in regions favored with 20 to 60 inches annual rainfall, while ninety-three percent inhabit altitudes under 1,500 feet The hordes that vexed Persia, Greece, and Rome with intermittent irruptions emerged from a high pastoral region whose scanty herbage required a wide range for the flocks and herds of a nomadic people. Probably the fundamental cause of every barbarian irruption was a partial failure of the food supplies; and the desperate nomads concentrated their military strength by drawing together from over a vast extent of territory. But it is notorious that ancient historians almost uniformly grossly exaggerated their numbers, being prompted thereto by both fear and vanity. The desperate ferocity, Uncouth appearance, and revolting habits of the interlopers inspired terror in the civilized nations, sometimes to the point of paralyzing their power to resist Thus we read that at the ajyjea^ance of a single mounted Mongol with a spear, whole crowds of timid Central Asiatics would throw themselves prostrate, supinely submitting to be slaughtered. If the machinery of civilization today were to break down</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">through interior disorders, so that we decayed to the barbarian level of puissance, and it be- _ became possible for the degraded natives of Africa, the Orient, and the unassimilated deni- / sens of our slums to submerge us, we probably would experience a similar feeling of horror, J fear, and aversion. That the invading hordes . were numerically inferior to the invaded ia \ ' patent; for when they migrated, although they .; moved en masse with their families and their &gt;&nbsp;cattle, leaving the country often vacant in their rear (as did the Vandalic tribes when they de- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">serted their old haunts south of the Baltic) the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">subjected populations speedily absorbed them, : as the provincial Italians, Spaniards, and Gauls absorbed the Lombards, Goths, and Franks; the '■ Moors and the Berbers, the Arabs; and the Chinese, the Tartars. On the contrary, when a civilized race subjugates a race much inferior ; to itself in point of culture, the tendency is for -the more barbarous people to be absorbed or exterminated by the conquerors, as with the ‘ i Indians here in the United States. So we must dismiss the notion that barbarism ever overwhelmed civilization by weight of numbers, or I. that civilization was ever in any serious danger from barbarian interference until decadence had set in or until internal distension had brok- 1 en down the defenses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">That the population of the earth has steadily ■ increased throughout the ages, there appears to I be ample testimony. It is estimated that the in- &lt;&nbsp;crease has been one hundred percent during the h nineteenth century. At the beginning of that ! century immense areas now covered with flour- 1 ishing farms and manufacturing centers were ; lonely wildernesses, the habitat of beasts and ■ roving bands of savages. Two centuries earlier . some of the most thickly settled parts of Europe ; today approximated in character to our fron- ' tier settlements of fifty years ago. The early ■ voyagers and explorers found most of the new- : found lands but sparsely inhabited; and for several centuries after their discovery the oceanle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">islands, such as St. Helena, the Falklands, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Galapagos, and Juan Fernandes, which now harbor settlements, were devoid of life other ; than that of seals, sea-fowl, crabs, and turtles. ■ Since even today there remain vast areas with a population of less than one person to the - i</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">square mile, a thousand years ago much of the earth's surface must have been wholly destitute of human inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ . The Chinese were the earliest nation to keep systematic census records. These records, which eover many centuries, show that in former times China did not support the same ant-like swarms as at present; but that the Li Min, or “Blackhaired Race,” has steadily expanded in num, bers, like the rest of mankind. The original *■ Chung Kwoh, or the Middle Kingdom, comprised virtually the Yellow river valley; the Yangtse basin, Szetchuan, the littoral belt, and the south consisted largely of forest, marsh, and jungle thinly inhabited by the aboriginal man, Laos, and Miaotse tribes. By degrees, these were partly sinicized and redeemed from savagery, and eventually were crowded out entirely into Indo-China by the Chinese, as the latter under Tartar pressure from the north were obliged to find new<sup>7</sup> homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It was not until the third century B. C. that the southern barbarians were conquered and ✓ nominally attached to the empire by the Ts*in ' Sha Hwang-ti, who established a system of centralized absolutism on the ruins of Chow ’ feudalism. As late as Han times — a contemporary with the Roman period, when China became a greater empire stretching as far west as the Caspian—the pure Chinese were confined mainly to the north, and the south was still only semi-sinicized; whereas today the reverse is the case, the Southerners being the purest representatives of the stock, and the Northerners a • mixed race largely of Tartar extraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In the time of Solomon the greater part of tropical Asia must have been uninhabited by * man, except for scattered tribes of savages /-whose representatives still linger in the inaccessible forest and mountain districts of •' southern and eastern Asia and its islands. IndoChina was settled from China, Thibet, and India withih historic times. The first Hindu colonists ' of Langka, or Ceylon, under Wijayu Balm, who <sup>r</sup> about 500 B. C. founded there the kingdom of Sihala, met with no opposition save the futile resistance qf the feeble Veddahs. From Hindu <sub>c</sub> literary sources we gather that the incoming Aryas f?om the northeast, as they slowly spread over the Ganges plain, encountered greater obstacles from the forest and the jungle and from wild beasts than from the aboriginiea.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Some uncritical Orientalists have been led astray by the p r e t e n s i 0 n s of Far Eastern nations to an incredibly remote origin into fancying that India or China antedates in the commencement of their civilization even Egypt and Mesopotamia. This is sheer illusion; for all<sub>t </sub>ancient peoples have bolstered up their national pride by claiming descent from gods and heroes; and their authentic annals are invariably prefaced with a mythological period. India and China are not exceptions to this rule, nor is Japan, which dates back to the apocryphal Jimmu Temmu, the contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar. But this claim must be regarded as spurious when subjected to critical analysis; for the really authentic annals of Nippon commence with the third century A. D., when the Empress Jingo Kogo conducted a plundering raid to Korea, bringing back captive artisans, who first inoculated the islanders with the arts of civilization. After'this, during the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries, the Korean phase of Chinese civilization took root in the archipelago and flourished. But the history of Japan properly commences about the time of Diocletian, prior to which the Japanese had only a foothold in Kyuslm and the southern extremity of Main Island, the remainder of the archipelago being in the hands of the hairy Ainu, whom the Nipponese only gradually displaced and drove northward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither was the vast continent of Africa always filled up with tribes, of blacks. The early Dutch colonists in South Africa came in contact with yellow Hottentots, a people inferior to the Kaffirs but, until decimated by the smallpox which the settlers introduced, the dominant race in that country. The Bantu hordes which poured down from the north, and were irresistible against their native predecessors because of their superior equipment and organization, were more recent arrivals. Anthropologists believe that Africa south of the Soudan </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">has been </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">occupied by tribes of true negroid stock only within the Inst few centuries. Before that time various tribes with Hottentot affinities roamed over the country; and before their advent the only inhabitants were scattered bands of Bushmen and Pygmies. A contributing feature in support of this view ia that the native arts and easterns bear a aharacterintic resemblance to those </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> the ancient Egyptians, with whom their</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ancestors doubtless communicated for many centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The probabilities are that a thousand years ago much of the earth’s surface was yet unvisited by man. The evidence strongly favors the view that not only Polynesia, but Australasia, have received their populations within a few centuries; and the Maoris retain traditions of a very recent arrival in New Zealand. American antiquarian research discloses remains which perhaps were contemporary with the Ice Age, but outside of a few favored regions in the high plateaus of the tropics little progress had been made from barbarism, and no density of population existed. Indeed, until the horse was introduced to western plains and Argentinian pampas, existence in those regions was extremely precarious. But when the Indians acquired mounts, and were able to travel rapidly and to hunt the bison and the guanaco, they rapidly increased in numbers. It is also likely that the numbers of the so-called civilized Aztecs, Caras, Chibchas, and Incas were grossly exaggerated by the Conquistadors, owing to a natural ambition to magnify their already astounding achievments. With all their cleverness and real accomplishment in certain arts of civilization, both the Aztecs and the Peruvians must be classified as barbarians. The former, indeed, have been stigmatized a mob of snake-worshiping cannibals; and the latter supply an example of a soul-saving paternalistic government, so destructive of free will and individual initiative ! that its victims have not yet fully recovered from their spiritual torpor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">• We have endeavored to show that a thousand years ago neither the Far East, the bulk of Africa, nor America codld have been densely populated. If we go back two thousand years earlier, to about the time of Solomon, we find Europe also barbarous and therefore unable to support a heavy population. At that time the civilfeed areas included Mesopotamia, the Nile valley, the Levant, and contiguous regions; and within this area was probably concentrated more thap half of the human race. The oldest relics of civilization are found in this region, and the oldest human traditions cluster about it. In faiJt, the oldest relics yet discovered have been exhumed in lower Mesopotamia, in the country near the mouths of the two rivers which its own people called Sumer, and Accad, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">which the Greeks and Romans called Chaldea and Babylonia. Here wheat is said to be indigenous, and here the earliest civilization seems to have been identified with the growing of wheat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Here it is that the mighty Babylon arose, once &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the hub Of civilization and the marvel of the .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nations. The heart of Babylon was the celebrat- • I ed E-Zagila, temple of Bel Marduk, tutelary deity of Kadingiri, or Babylon, whose towering j ziggurat, or seven-storied shrine-tower, was the loftiest edifice, probably, in western Asia and is <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">supposed, like all ziggurats, to commemorate the Tower of BabeL E-Zagila, which in a sense combined the functions of a Vatican, Bank of London, and Stock Exchange, was the center of activity for the commercial as well as the j religious life of western Asia, and constituted the real seat of government of the hereditary merchant-priest hierarchy which furnished Babylon with kings. The report and the influence of this sacred place were so widespread that even haughty Assyrian conquerors bowed their heads and entered its precincts to perform &lt;&nbsp;the solemn investiture ceremony of &quot;taking the hands of Bel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Possibly there is a symbolical meaning attached to the account of the Tower of BabeL Perhaps the descendants of Noah aspired to unlawful human powers and knowledge and to equality with the Deity. Maybe the confusion of tongues that terminated this quest was the natural sequence of their presumptuous attempt. Our data are too meager to afford a clue; but Babylonian mythology preserved distorted traditions of this event, as well as of the Deluge, the Fall, and the Tree of Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There is, then, a strong assumption — aside from Scriptural testimony—that Babylonia was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">not only the cradle of civilization but also the radial center from which mankind spread out over the earth. The historian Budge asserts that the pre-dynastic Egyptians were of Asiatio ' origin, the probability being that the Shemsn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heru, or Horus, worshipers, who founded the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Red and White Kingdoms which Me-na, or Menes, afterwards coalesced under the Double : Crown, came from Mesopotamia. The arts, customs, and religion of nearly all west-Asiatic nations bear a Babylonian impress; and there is a certain affinity between the culture of these <sup>! </sup>and that of the mysterious people whom the ; Egyptians called the Kheftin; and modern</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">archaeologists, ignorant of their national appellation, since their inscriptions are yet unde, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cipherable for want of a key, Minoans. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">people dwelt principally in Crete and the uEgean, and were the civilized predecessors of ’ the Greeks, who builded on their foundations, but seem not to have acknowledged the obli-. gation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Between this subversion by the horse-riding ~ Aehaians and the glorious age of Heller.dom 1 intervened the obscure period called the Heroic . Age, which approximates to the dark ages which succeeded the submergence of the Roman world by the Germanic nations. Their culture, which supplied the fundamentals for that of the Hellenes, was probably of Babylonian origin. Indeed, the culture of all the early nations seems to have been derived from the Sumt-ro-Ak-kadians. It is a misnomer to refer to the last-named people as Chaldeans; for the Chakleans ' were comparatively recent arrivals in the marsh lands at the mouths of the two rivers, who obtained political control in late Assyrian times, ,, setting up that Chaldean dynasty of which *' Nebuchadnezzar was the most prominent representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another country whose earliest arts and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">architecture resemble the Sumero-Akkadian was India; so it is likely that the principal preAryan inhabitants of this country were emigrants from Mesopotamia. The Chinese also came from Akkad, or from the adjacent country of Elani, according to the Sinalogue Terrien La Couperie, who offered an array of evidence ’ in proof of his contention, one item being the apparent identification of Hu-Nakhunte with the Chinese mythological hero Nai Hwang-ti. However,sinalogues generally rejected La Couperie’s ■ opinions, though for the most part agreeing that the Chinese originated somewhere west of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">4- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As Pastor Russell pointed out, all the evi- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;den«e supplied by hieroglyph and cuneiform is</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">• very uncertain when it comes to dating events. V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is misleading to assign dates arbitrarily</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">centuries apart to monarchs who very likely were contemporaries. Because the patesi of Gisle-ftan, Lugal-zag-gisi, vain-gloriously styled * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself* “king of the four comers of the earth&quot;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">it does not follow that the king of Akkad, Shar-. gani-shar-ali who arrogated the same title, must . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have lived two hundred years later. Historians</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">assume that it must have taken centuries in that early time for the same degree of progress to -transpire as now takes only a few years; and that during these slow centuries fashions, customs, and arts remained at a dead level of ~ stagnation. Nevertheless in truly historic times, in Assyria, we perceive very rapid changes and , -progress, if the inscriptions are a reliable witness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of the undeniable credit due to the archeologists for their diligent and painstaking research, it is patent that they often allow their prejudices and preconceptions to warp their judgment. They have discovered so much that confirms the Scriptural narrative that their pertinacity in trying to refute the Bible has the color of willful obstinacy. For instance, in the reign of Merenptah of the XTX Dynasty, who was the Pharaoh of the Exodus, occurred a perilous raid of the sea peoples against Egypt. These were the Aehaians, Sardinians, Phrygians, etc., who in concert with Lybians made a combined onslaught on the Delta. It taxed the whole power of Egypt to repel the invasion; and while Merenptah was absent at the head of his forces, the Hebrews under Moses seized the -opportunity to escape out of bondage. Perhaps a harassed monarch, already daunted by the plagues which befell his nation, and reluctant to leave a powerful body of malcontents in his rear, had yielded the Hebrews permission to depart. But af ter his overwhelming victory over the invaders, he repented of his leniency, re- ’ tracted his promise, and dispatched a picked ' body of charioteers under his son, the crown prince, to bring the Hebrews back. The inscription contains a lament for the drowning of his son, together with the flower of the Egyptian army, in the Red Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The historians, struck with the unexpected testimony of the inscriptions concerning the Passover, nevertheless endeavor to disparage the miracle, alleging that the passage occurred in an arm of the Red Sea where the tides resemble those in the Bay of Fundy. Neither the Hebrews nor the Egyptians, they explain,. were familiar with tides. The former had the luck to cross at the ebb, and the latter had the . misfortune to be caught in the returning flood. Against this argument, it is said that there are no sueh extreme tides in that locality; that the Hebrews did not cross at that point; and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the Egyptians were familiar with the Red Sea . and its tides for centuries prior to this event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I believe that a candid examination of facts will disprove the theory that mankind has progressed upward from anthropoid apes, through the various stages of savagery, barbarism, and semi-civilization to the civilization of today. However, the college professors and-other evolutionists have erected a huge superstructure of fanciful conjecture on the slender evidence of a few skulls, flint implements, and rude scratch-■ ings in the walls of caves. This is called higher education. Indeed, some of our museums contain portrait-busts of Pithecanthropus, Neanderthal, and Cro-Magnon, with their supposed relics carefully classified and tabulated, and explanatory descriptions relating in detail the customs, social relations, dress, and politics of these forgotten races. That is, we are informed respecting the “probabilities” concerning them; for the evidence is admittedly slight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The more rational view, I believe, is to regard savages as degenerate descendants of outcasts from superior races — of the refugees, scapegoats, fugitive slaves, and the like, who fled into the wilderness in couples or in family groups; and isolated from all contact with society at large, and exposed to appalling hardships, these descendants deteriorated during many generations into a condition of savagery. We have recent examples of such tendency to deterioration in our own frontier history and in the case of the mountaineers and “poor whites” of the South. Under the rigorous conditions of the Ice Age the tendency toward racial deterioration must have been very great indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The foregoing are some of the arguments which occurred to me when I sought to reconcile the teachings of history with those of the Bible. What historical truth we possess is so garbled, distorted, and interwoven with the false conceptions and prejudices of historians that even historic facts frequently, through being seen from a wrong perspective, seem to belie the Bible. My father pointed out to me when as a boy I placed implicit credence in history, that the latter is not so much a record of facts as the. expression of the views of historians. The Chinese used to have a law prohibiting the official historians from publishing the current annals during the tenure of the reigning dynasty. This safeguarded the annalist from the resentment of his rulers, and permitted him a free expression of the truth. But this custom has rarely, if ever, prevailed elsewhere. On the contrary there have occasionally been proscriptions of unpopular chronologists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In this coming kingdom of Messiah perhaps we may learn the real facts about antiquity. More likely, however, we shall not be interested in them. As it is written, &quot;the old world will not be remembered or come into mind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">392. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Briefly estimate the number of the human race from creation io the present time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This is an important point. How strange it would be if we should find that while the Bible dedares a resurrection for all men, yet by actual measurement, they could not find a footing on the earth I Now let us see. Figure it out and you will find this an unfounded fear. You will find that there is an abundance of room for the “restitution qf all”, as “God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us^hssume that it is six thousand years since the creation of man, and that there are fourteen hundred millions of people now living on the earth. Our race began with one pair, but let us make a very liberal estimate and suppose that there were as many at the beginning as there are now! and, further, that there never were fewer than that number at any time, though actually the flood reduced the population to eight persons. Again, let us be liberal, and estimate three generations to a century, or thirty-three years to a generation, though according to Genesis 5 there were but eleven generations from Adam to the flood, a period of one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years, or about one hundred and fifty years to each generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Now let us see: Six thousand years are sixty</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">centuries; three generations to each century would give us one hundred and eighty generations since Adam; and fourteen hundred millions to a generation would give two hundred and fifty-two billions (252,000,000,000) as the total number of our race from creation to the present time, according to this liberal estimate, which is probably more than twice the actual number.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">293.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Where shall we find room for this vast multitude? How many would the State of Texas accommodate. as a cemetery t</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">AVhere shall we find room enough for this great multitude! Let us measure the land, and see. The State of Texas, United States, contains two hundred and thirty-seven thousand square miles. There are twenty-seven million eight hundred and seventy-eight thousand four hundred square feet in a mile, and, therefore, six trillion six hundred and seven billion one hundred and eighty million eight hundred thousand (6,607,180,800.000) square feet in Texas. Allowing ten square feet as the surface covered by each dead body, we find that Texas, as a cemetery, would at this rate hold six hundred and sixty billion seven hundred and eighteen million and eighty thousand (660,718,080,0w) bodies, or nearly three times as many as our exaggerated estimate of the numbers of our race who have lived on the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">294. TVAer* </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">could this number find standing roomf</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A person standing occupies about one and two-thirds square feet of space. At this rate the present population of the earth (one billion six hundred million persons)could stand on an area of eighty-six square miles—an area much less than that of the city of London or of Philadelphia. And the island of Ireland (area thirty-two thousand square miles)would furnish standing-room for more than twice the number of people who have ever lived on the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There is not much difficulty, then, in settling this objection. And when we call to mind the prophecy of Isaiah(35: l-6)that the earth shall yield her increase; that the desert shall rejoice and blostom'-as the rose; that in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert, we see that God indicates that He has foreseen all the necessities of His plan, and will make ample provision for the needs of His creatures in what will seem a very natural way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It may be objected by some that the testimony » of the Scriptures concerning human restitution to a former estate is out of harmony with the * teachings of science and philosophy, which, with / 1 apparent reason, point us to the superior intelligence of this twentieth century, and claim this { 1 as conclusive evidence that primeval man must i 1 have been, in comparison, very lacking in intel- i ligence, which they claim is the result of devel- <sup>!</sup> I opment. From this standpoint a restitution to a former estate would be far from desirable, ’ and certainly the reverse of a blessing. , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">At first sight such reasonin ' appears plausible, and many seem inclined to accept it as truth j without careful examination, saying, with a | celebrated Brooklyn preacher, “If Adam fell at . all his fall was upward, and the more and faster we fall from his original state the better for us j and for all concerned”.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark48"><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus philosophy, even in the pulpit, would</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sible convince us that the apostles were fools when they declared that death and every trouble came by the first man’s disobedience, and that these could be removed and man restored to divine favor and life only by means of a ran- j som. (Romans 5:10, 12, 17-19, 21; 8:19-22; Acts 3:19-21; Revelation 21:3-5) But let us not hastily conclude that this philosophy is impreg- j nable; for should we be obliged to discard the &gt;&nbsp;1 doctrines of the apostles relative to the origin of sin and death, and of restitution to an orig- ? inal perfection, we should, in honesty, be obliged &quot;&nbsp;to reject their testimony entirely and on every j subject as uninspired, and consequently without * special weight or authority.

Hence this age may be regarded and designated as the brain age. Brain pushes the great enterprises of the day. Brain takes the reins of government; and the elements of the earth, air and water are being brought under subjection. Man is putting his hand on all physical forces and slowly but surely attaining such power over the domain of nature as gives evidence that ultimately he may exclaim, in the language of Alexander Selkirk, *1 am monarch of all I survey’.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The fact that at first glance a theory appears reasonable should not lead us hastily to accept it, and to attempt to twist the Bible into harmony with it. In a thousand ways we have proved the Bible, and know beyond peradventure that it contains a superhuman wisdom which make its statements unerring. We should remember, too, that while scientific research is to be commended and its suggestions considered, yet its conclusions are by no means infallible. And what wonder that it has proven its own theories false a thousand times, when we remember that the true scientist is merely a 1 student attempting, under many unfavorable circumstances and struggling against almost in- - -surmountable difficulties, to learn from the . great book of Nature the history and destiny <sub>c </sub>of man and his home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> would not, then, either oppose or hinder scientific investigation; but in hearing sugges- $ tions from students of the Book of Nature let us carefully compare their deductions, which have so often proved in part or wholly erroneous, with the Book of Divine Revelation, and f prove or disprove the teachings of scientists by ’ “the law and the testimony. If they speak not -~ according to this word, it is because there is no ■ light in them.”(Isaiah 8: 20) An accurate knowledge of both books will prove them to be harmonious; but until we have such knowledge, - , God’s revelation must take precedence, and ’ must be the standard among the children of God by which the supposed findings of fallible fellow men shall be judged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What third &quot;way&quot; is mentioned in Isaiah 35:8! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">; Ans.: The highway, or way of holiness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ 2. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What is a highway!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. Ans.: It is a main road for the people to travel upon and is usually kept in good condition with all the stones gathered out so as to make travel easy and comfortable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Why shall it“be called the way of holiness? J</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.: Because all who will walk that way will be thoroughly consecrated, or set apart to do the Lord’s will, to follow His way and not their own way.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Will it be easier then to walk in the Lords way, &quot;the way of holiness,&quot; than it is now to walk in &quot;the narrow way&quot;?..................</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.: Yes; for Satan will be bound (Revelation 20: 2), the stumbling stones (errors) will be gathered out (Isaiah 63:10), “the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea” (Habakkuk 2:14), and “the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off the earth”.—Isaiah 25:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Who are &quot;the unclean</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> [that] </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shall not pass over it”!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.; All mankind are imperfect (Romans 3:23) and therefore ''unclean” in God’s sight, except those who are &quot;justified” (made right—made clean) by faith (Romans 5:1), the church class, the truly consecrated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> How was this shown in the case of Cornelius!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.: Cornelius was the first gentile accepted of the Lord to walk in the narrow way to life. St. Peter, along with all Jews, had been taught that all gentiles were unclean, and that he must “not keep company or come unto one of another nation&quot;. (Acts 10: 28) This thought was so fixed in St. Peter’s mind that God sent him a vision (Acts 10: 9-15) of unclean animals (representing gentiles) to show him that the time had come for God to accept from any nation any one who “feared” (reverenced) God and worked righteousness.—Acts 10: 34,35.</span></p>

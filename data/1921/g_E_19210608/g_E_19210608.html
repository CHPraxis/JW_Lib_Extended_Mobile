<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Glancing Backward at “Unrest”</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">1</span><span class="font10">00KING over the literature of the past two years one is astonished to see how much was said on the subject of unrest a year or two ago and liow little is said today. Either there were forces then at work to produce unrest that are not now at work, or reasons then existed for playing this subject up in great headlines that do not now exist. We examine the subject with a view to ascertaining some of the basic facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A first glance at the subject reveals the economic situation as the fundamental cause of i all the unrest. The causes assigned for it are insufficient wages, fear of poverty, fear of loss of employment, excessive hours of labor, reluctance to work too hard for fear of working one’s self out of a job, inequitable wage schedules, lack of adequate housing, extortionate rents, profiteering in the necessities of life, high . infant mortality, ignorance, restriction of free speech by those who would complain of any of the foregoing. So much for the workers’ side of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other side of the problem the causes alleged are the lack of contact between employer and employe, the employer’s disregard of human suffering, his mad desire to get rich quickly, his spectacular profits, his love of display*, his bowing down to the demon of speed and his break-down in character structure as respects his relations to the opposite sex. We oannot hope to treat all of these subjects in this article, but will glance at some of them and touch others not yet mentioned.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>War and Unrest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">T IS all very<sup>-</sup> well for people to run around during war time and proclaim it as the greatest of all uplifters, but every person engaged in distributing that kind of information knows in his heart that there is not a word of truth in it. Every great war is followed by a period of social unrest and the greater the war the greater the unrest which follows it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">War dislocates the avenues of production and trade, overturns all industrial habits, upsets all routines, upsets all values, removes all standards of work and living and takes the most efficient and capable workers away from their tasks altogether. 11 , disintegrates families, wrecks tlie morals of both men and women, glorifies murder and is a school for brutality of thought and conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After a great war the nerves of men and women are worn out and they are more ready than ever before to find fault and to take offense. They are impatient of all restraint, quarrelsome and prone to snap judgment. The disbandment of the armies floods the labor market inmiediately, and inevitably brings on labor troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">War is the harvest time of profiteers; it is the time of the ruin of myriads of young men and women; it is a time when marriage vows are not respected; it is a time when men live with other then’s wives and women live with other women's husbands. Family life is broken up for years. During the World War there were thousands of instances where the husbands were away from home for five years and while they were gone the modern dances and the automobiles of those that reveled in the profits at home made ruin out of their domestic relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- Do you wish to know why you could not pick up a “ne'ws” paper two years ago without finding the word “Bolshevism&quot; in every column and now you rarely see the word at all! We will tell you. The profiteers had made from the blood and tears of Europe such fortunes as were never before heard of on earth; they wanted to keep these fortunes; the common</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">people must not use them to pay the eost of the war; they must not itse them to-- lighten the-bnrdens pilefl upon them ami their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bolshevism and Unrest</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE thing to do was to start a great hue and cry against thieves in Russia, so that nobody would dare cry out against the.thieves in-the United States. But just as soon as the Supreme Court decided that the profiteers cnuld keep all they stole during the war, awl that those who had been actually found guilty of violating the Lever Act should have their lines returned to them, there was no necessity to cry' “Bolshevism&quot; longer and the •'news” papers stopped talking about the danger of it in the United States—of which there never has'been the least danger up to this writing. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bolshevism cannot come in any land where the masses of the people own property, hut it can come in a laud where the common people are robbed thoroughly enough and persistently enough so that they have, as they think, nothing’ to lose and everything to gain.by attempting’ the impracticable scheme of communism. Communism has lieen tried a good many times in the last one hundred and fifty years ami has never worked and cannot work while human nature is what it now is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was tried in the early church, the most likely place in the world for it to succeed, and even the warmth of early Christianity was not sufficient to bring it to perfection. In the Middle Ages it was tried by the Franciscans and the Brothers of the Common Lot; later by the Shakers, Oneida Community and Harmony Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In America the Pilgrim fathers tried communism but abandoned it after four years, saying, by way of explanation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“This i-omnnniitie (so fan- as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much iniployment'that would have lieen to their benefite and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">eomfoHe. </span><span class="font8">For the youg men that wer not able and fitte for labour and service djd repine that they should spend their time anil streingth to worke for other men’s wives and children, without any recompenee. And for men’s wives to be commanded to doe service for other men, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">dressing ffieir meats, washing their cloaths. etc., </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rhey deputed </span><span class="font8">it a kind of slaverie, neither eotdd many Ipivhands well hrooke it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Communism, in the form in which it is practised in. Russia, is not extending into Ronmania, Servia, Bulgaria and Greece, ami there is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">reason for it. Those countries, although they are , i near tn Russia, are mainly agricultural eoun-tries,' ami as the peasants have all the land j they need in order to support their families they have no incentive toward Bolshevism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark8"><span class="font10">There is more danger of the spread of it to</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font10">Italy, France mid England.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font10">America is a peculiar country in the fact that 1 58 percent of alt the workers in her industries j were born in-other countries. In some instances</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font10">rhis is as high as 85 percent. These workers</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">are segregated into racial groups.and it takes ( ‘ some time before they accumulate property and learn American ways and-customs. It was this J condition that was taken advantage of, after 1 the war. by those who had lieen ami were profi- ’ teering. They spread far ami wide the lielief &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">that these workers were trying to seize tlio &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">j</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">country; and in the reign of terror which followed,. America was treated to such a spectacle of abuse of innocent foreigners as was never j before witnessed on these shores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Excuses for Unrest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font10"> LL kinds of excuses were invented to ae mint i for the “unrest” which was laid at the doom ) of these allegofl Bolslievists. Brigadier General ■ Georg*' II. Harries solemnly declared his belief at Atlantic City that the unrest was entirely due ) to German propaganda. Bernard Nolan,, president of a Pressmen's Union, declared it was due- , to anarchists working among the printers, and ) a United States federal judge declared from the J liench that it was partially Imancvd ami man- i aged by the federal government itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was claimed by some that all the “unrest” ’ , among the workers was due to foreign agitators | ami then Arthur Woods-, former- Police Commissioner of New York City, threw some light • : on the situation when he said in an address at | Harvard: “Agitators are thoroughly wholesome . things, and unrest is a thoroughly wholesome state of mind. If we don't have unrest, if we 1 don't agitate for letter things, if there is not .a wholesome discontent, we shall not make prog- .' ress. Discontent is nothing in a. certain senna but another word for ambition, and if we have <sup>: </sup>not ambition we don't get far.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The epithet “Bolshevist” was bandied around | pretty freely a year or two ago by those, who - J wanted to cover up their profiteering or in other | ways- parade a bogus patriotism. In Winnipeg 3 where, during the war, Rev. Gordon distinguish- &gt;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ed himself by the teaching that any soldier who died in the World War, dressed in the uniform of King George, was sure of going to heaven, no matter what kind of private life lie ha 1 led, the soldiers who, after the war, were working ten hours a day without any chance for recreation, were called Bolshevists for attempting to improve their condition. The chasm between a dead saint and a living Bolshevist is only such a chasm as can be made by a bullet penetrating a few inches of flesh. If you get the • ■ bullet you are a saint; if not, a Bolshevist. Now then, three cheers— for what’</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Prohibition and Unrest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">V</span><span class="font10">AST fortunes have been made in America in the liquor business. Many great fortunes in Boston and elsewhere, supposedly made in the “East India Trade ’, were really made by taking cargoes of rum to Africa, with which to debauch the natives, and the return cargo was a -argo of slaves, for the cotton and tobacco fields of the South. And long after the slave traffic was a thing of the past other great for, tunes were made by selling poisonous mixtures the immediate effect of which was to destroy the reason, will and physical health of the men of America and to ruin the happiness of their homes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some attempt has been made by the holders of these fortunes, and their successors, to show that unrest has been due to prohibition. It has been seriously charged that by )\ moving from the brains of the workers that deadener of all the finer faculties, alcohol, they have become thinkers and that it is perilous to “sassiety&quot; for the workers to think. &quot;Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Others have argued that it has been very evident to the poor that prohibition is prohibition for the poor but not prohibition for the rich, because iiyllionaires have their cellars full of wines and may drink as much as they like,'and that this sense of the inequalities of things has had to do with creating unrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Still others, of a more practical turn of mind, avoiding all kheSe superficial reasons tending to show that-prohibition causes unrest, have pointed specifically to the evidence that prohibition has injured the business of the nation for the reason that just at the time when the farmers were praying for cars to save their grain</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">...................---------...............................■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">it developed that there were sixteeja hundred empty box cars held on sidings at Louisville, Kentucky, awaiting a grand rush of whiskey to market in all corners of the country if the' President had removed the ban from liquur, as it wtts at that time hoped that he would do.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Wage-Earners and Unrest •</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">rpHERE was a time when it was a statutory offense to increase a workingman’s wages above a certain amount, when a workingman could be put in jail for owing a storekeeper ten cents, and when a good mechanic received but fifty cents a day, and could buy but little more for the fifty cents than he can buy today. Times have changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The war acted as a tonic to wage-earners all over the world. They were led to believe that the war was their war, fought in their behalf, at their expense, and with their bodies in the . front line trenches, protecting the civilization that was at stake. They were encouraged to believe that after the war labor would no longer be treated as a commodity, to be engaged as low as possible and worked,as many hours as possible; they were assured that Big Business would see to it that the Golden Rule would be applied to those who had saved their necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">President Wilson said that after the war, “There must be a genuine democratization- of industry, based on a full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare or the part they are to play in industry&quot;. Of course, nothing was changed; there was no more democracy than before the war; the men have been gradually dropped from the payrolls and their wages reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The steel trust raised wages eight times during the war, in an effort to keep the wages of the men on a par with the ever rising cost of living — a difficult job. The workers in that' Industry made an effort to deal with Mr. Gary, its President, through the medium of a labor leader who viewed the twelve-hour day ami the seven-day week as a thing abhorrent. Judge Gary would have nothing to do with him and was cheered to the echo by fifteen hundred members of the American Iron and Steel Institute when he declared his determination to run his great business in his own way.

<p><span class="font10">hours of work still prevail, but the wages are coming down. Nails are still ten cents a pound, which is twice what they ought to l&gt;e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are three hundred thousand men on the steel trust’s payrolls, and these men could easily do in eight hours all the work they do in twelve, if a means could be found to convince them that it would not reduce their earnings or result in their loss of employment As it is there is a well-settled code among them to do about as little as they conveniently can. The same conditions are to I&gt;e found in many other industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the war it was difficult for the soldiers to get back at their old tasks. As business gets better and better, organized workmen find less and less of interest in their work and find the tasks more and more monotonous. Standardizing is essential to enable quantity production at low cost, but it is unpopular with the workers and a fruitful cause of strikes.. The strike may have something else as its pretext, but the chance to get away from a monotonous task for a few days is one that is very agreeable to many workers. The unrest was greatest in the smaller cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were others than factory workers who were dissatisfied. College professors were in the same class. If it were not such a serious matter one would be almost tempted to </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">smil</span><span class="font10">e at the information gravely set before the Association of American Colleges by Dr. George L. McIntosh, professor of Wabash College, when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;A great deal of the spirit of unrest and expressions of radicalism through the country might never have existed if people had seen to it that teachers in schools and colleges were given reasonable salaries”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The unrest has been as great or greater in England than in America. Few can estimate the terrible blow that England received during the war. Tin<sup>1</sup> workers are better organized and more^determined there than anywhere else in the world. For a year past the workers in Great Britain have been limiting output, believing it the only way that loss of employment could be staved ^1T, and, the manufacturers have been friendly to the idea because it seemed to them the only^way that they could maintain prices. Lord Leverhulme, one of England's self-made men, and a truly great mhn, has proposed higher speeds at the factory, and more hours of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">leisure for the workers, as a cure for unrest. In his own great soap business he has demon- ? strafed tliat six hours is sufficient for a day’s wort &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is less than a year since the French govern?- ! inent made a practice of closing all the hotels and restaurants early in the evening, by curfew law, so that the workers would not be greeted with the spectaele of the new rich going home • i in their automobiles at the same hour that the workers were rising to go about their daily toil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font10">ROFITEERS always fatten in time of war, and when war is over it is always their wish , that scarcity and high prices shall continue evermore. When it was seen that the United States would surely enter the war a band of earnest and honest men in New York besought the i President to have a law passed strictly limiting the profits in all lines of business to ftie legal rate of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">None of the patriots who had inunitions of I war to sell would agree to anything of the kind and the matter received virtually no publicity, but it would have saved hundreds of millions- i of dollars and endless discontent, for there is no doubt that the unbridled greed and ba-efaced robbery of the war time was the greatest of all 3 real causes of unrest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the same time that girls in Quebec cotton factories were working ten hours a day, the owners of the factories were being paid in an- . I nual dividends one and one-half times the total cost of their entire plants. One Lancashire cotton factory that made $40,000 a year in | profits before the war cleared fifty times as much in the year 1919. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">America is blessed with food pirates that delight in publishing books telling how small ’ their profits are on sales, but the books do not contain the self-evident information that if you . can turn yonr money over at two percent profit every ten days you can clear seventy-three per- , cent a year on your investment; nor do they go ,,<sub>4 </sub>into details about the quantities of food con- -4 signed to incinerators rather than reduce the price to the people. They do- not dilate on the cargoes of fish, the carloads of onions and train- J loads of other foods which are destroyed rather than give the people cheap food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a merchant or a manufacturer makes more than a fair percentage of profit the excess •: is deducted from the earnings of workers and the buying power of the workers is necessarily’ lowered, along with their standard of living. All the excess profits of the profiteers and prodigals must be paid for in hard work by the real producers. The Kaiser is not the only culprit that was guilty of bringing on the war, or of encouraging it, that is living on the fat of the Lind. Among the profiteers is many a Kaiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The war has been the opportunity for Big .business to crush little business. Big Business ■, as kept measurably independent of labor •anions in the United States; hence the labor unions have made their greatest exactions from the smaller businesses, the ones that were least fitted to bear the strain. The smaller businesses and the labor unions are going down together, and the banks are greasing the toboggan for their exit. The slogan of the banks now is, “No money to loan to any concern that employs exclusively union labor”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Henri Barbusse, the great French writer, in an article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The World Tomorrow</span><span class="font10"> writes of ‘‘the leaders and the profiteers of the multitudes , they divide, men whom an almost supernatural prestige has permitted until now to do evil on the grand scale, crushing out the life of the people in excessive hours of labor and in secret . misery, driving them a‘ the last to early and sacrificial death by battle and blockade”. If Henri had said such things as this in America during the reign of the late emperor he would have been deported as an undesirable alien, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. Vice President Coolidge has offered six items of advice on how to cure unrest. The first and most important of these touches the vital spot. He urges America and the world to “abandon the mad scramble for money and get back to the Plymouth rock standard of believing that ‘to do something for some one else’ is better than to accumulate wealth&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One cause of excessive prices is that during the why goods were bought from the United States by foreign buyers without thought of price, and were sold without any regard as to whether or not supplies were left in America. This created a real shortage and the law of supply and demand operated to bring about a reign of extremely high prices. But there have been, here and there, splendid examples of men unwilling to take advantage of their fellow men to seize all the profits within their reach; splendid men, these.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">It was over a year ago that the great financiers of America decided that the time had coine to pirt an end to all the high hopes that had been created in the minds of the workers. The farm-era were to he tlmroughly deflated first, because they were not organized and could lie reached direetiy by the lianks. The laboa* unions were .to come, next: ahd the boding and mowing and gi.hl&gt;eriug of tire mouth pieces of tlvese financiers . Iiegan at once, ere the plans for destroying the unions could be got under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In its issue of April 28, 1920*, the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Time*</span><span class="font10"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;ft is going to be a hard campaign to sav«’~Anierican institutions from the enemy within. There should be no discharge in this war which is to l&gt;e won by ideas, not lv brute force. The Chinniter of Commerce of the United States will put into the field the first line troops nd reserves of !.:►&lt;»&lt;&gt; trade and commercial organizations. They will Ite well supplied with ammunition in r.:e form of facts, logic and the lessons of experience. They will attack the strongholds of ignorance and fanaticism everywhere. Fundamental economies are to he talked from thousands of platforms. The American system of government is to Ite explained and illustrated in such a way as to silence detainers. The trail of the demagogue is to Ite followed anti his lies are to Ite nailed. Enemies of the government will Ite confronted ami e.x-jstsed wherever encountered. No rascal will Ite allowed to escape from public condemnation ami contempt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The history of the movement above outlined </span><span class="font8">shows </span><span class="font10">that its real object was to destroy the labor unions, nothing else, and that it had not the remotest intention of bringing to light the rascality manifested during the war. So far from bringing public condemnation ami contempt upon the thieves that robbed the people of the United States of billions of dollars in the construction of ships, the mismanagement of railroads, the supplying of rotten salmon, the destroying of needed food, and a thousand and one other things of equally atrocious nature, the men. that have done these things are in high bono^as industrial brigadiers and financial major generals in &quot;the first line troops and reserves” whose business it is to explain to the misguided individuals who believed in the four-t«-en points’\vhat is the real &quot;American system of government”. Stating it otherwise, the youth of the laird are to be instructed in honesty and good citizenship by the knights of the blackjack and the jimmy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hal H. Smith, Director of the Union Trust Company, Detroit, Michigan, in an address before the American Bankers’ Association, held at St. Louis, commenting on the same plan as discussed in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;This is not the time for the old conservative </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">liauker </span><span class="font8">who earned that name by sacrificing everything to his profit and loss account. This is the time for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a new anil </span><span class="font8">audacious l'auker who looks beyond the daily lialance sheet to the fundamentals of life; who is prepared for sacrifice ns are the employers and manufacturers wlvo may lose their industrial existence in defense of the principle of free employment. It was heartrending to read Mr. Morgan’s message to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Gary </span><span class="font8">demonstrating that one house, at least, approved his stand. How much mon* heartening it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">would be if other </span><span class="font8">luniks could recognize that the strike at the Steel Corporation is a blow at every bank, and could </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pledge </span><span class="font8">to it their support and could declare that wherever they saw the profiosal for tlie closed shop appearing they would immediately attempt to destroy it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">lu other words, here is a proposition that the concern that falls in liue with tlie new program is to lie granted loans in time of need, with the evident suggestion that the concern that &lt;loes not cooperate shall be led to the chopping block.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Occasionally a great financier has the courage — to see things as they are and to state them as they are. It is with not ajittle surprise and satisfaction that one reads in times like these such words as the following, from the pen of Rudolph Spreckels, millionaire president of the First National Bank of California:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■‘Congress is coutimially asked to protect capital and its methods of high finance. Protection and opportunity to i-or.tinue win nings upon their wati'rod securities while human beings starve, are demanded by men who know not hunger or want. Let not the spark of human kindness die'in America. We must not tolerate a continuation of commercial greed and the placing of dollars above human rights and needs. Etiro[&gt;e is demonstrating today the inevitable result the policy of commercial greed leads to. The toll in money and in human life now being paid ar the altar of governmental submission to the demands of capitalism should lie a warning that no intelligent American can afford to ignore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is too bad that the Federal Reserve Bank, that was organized to give the public a square deal, did not have some of the breadth of vision of Mr. Spreekels. Its action in boosting the interest rate to meinlter banks from four to six percent was the occasion for the maddest scramble for usury that the financiers of America have ever engaged in. It amounted in effect to a repudiation of a portion of the United Slates bonds, and. placed the Federal Reserve hi a conspicuous position among first-rank profiteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The argument is advanced that the possession of wealth has nothing to do with unrest, because thirty pereent of the world’s wealth is in the United States (a country which occupies only seven percent of the earth's surface and has but t-ix percent of its population) and yet there' is more restlessness and discontent here than in airy other country. This argument is only half stated. The wealthy here are too wealthy and the poor are too poor. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not a capital in Europe ran equal such luxury ns is to be found in the hotels and ball rooms of New York City and nowlrrre in the world is there to be seen swh a display of wealth as one ' may see on any line day on Riverside Drive, r’or five cents one can go from these scenes to habitations owned by the millionaire Trinity Church corporation where thousands of humah beings are huddled in quarters that are only tit for swine to occupy.'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Up till today the human race has lived according to laws which have embodied in many different forms _ &nbsp;&nbsp;the principle of the slavery of the crowd. Never has</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' &nbsp;&nbsp;the simple right pf every human being to life and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">happiness been truly respected. The ordinary man is no better off in these modern times than he was in the days of antiquity or in the Middle Ages.

<p><span class="font8">. The whole series of tragic events which we call history is for fins. most part a spectacle of a vast injustice and a vast absurdity. Nothing real is changed by merely t changing words. Only verbally have slavery and servi-Hide been abolished, and the privileges of birth. The life of the world is ceaselessly exploited and sacrificed by an oligaVehy V’hich seeks only its own narrow selfish i interests. This is the basis on which our present social order is built, a system which is an organized and continuous assault upon all truth and goodness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It should lie understood that this is the view of a Frenchman, and even if we eould not endorse all of his expressions no one can deny that there is much tpith in what he says and that his views are shared by an increasing number of bis fellow men. In itself it is an impeachment of ail governments of the earth as instruments of deceit and craelty. This would not mean that governments have no good in them, hut that they are not as good as<sup>1</sup> they pretend to be and their real motives are not the motives they proclaim loudest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the time of the war the United States government passed the Lever Act, to keep profiteers in cheek. It was distinctly understood and agreed at the time of the passage of this act that it would not be used against the workers, but it was used against them, and that was the only effective use that ever was made of the act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among the war measures was one which forbade trading with the enemy, and yet, while the country was technically at war with Germany the Government's own Shipping Board was dealing with German shipping companies for the taking over of former German trade routes, docks and harbor facilities. Many have the impression that in matters of this kind the government is an exception and can do what it will. Such is not the case. The government is obligated to abide hy the laws which the people have passed for their own protection, and when the government does not abide by those laws it is teaching anarchy in the most effective way in its power. Throughout the war the laws of the country, and particularly its highest law, the Constitution of the United States, was disregarded and held in contempt by the very highest officers of the land. This was a real cause of.unrest and this unrest is quieting down now that some of these officers have been displaced by saner and more law-abiding men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;While the lawlessness at Washington was at its height, Edward T. Devine issued an address -to the president imploring him to return to law and order, in the following language, and it is a remarkable thing that such words should have received so little notice from those self-advertised “Palladiums of American Liberty'”, the &quot;news&quot; papers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

Let legislative assemblies give patient hearing to delegates who edme to them from such assemblies. Let grand juries weigh their complaints, whether against individuals or against any existing abuse which mightAe remedied. Let the industries be represented by their detectives, not to spot agitators to discharge them, but to make careful note of any bad praetic' s which might«be reformed. Let radical journals lie published freely and let courts, prosecutors, legislators and. executives study them anxiously to see what evidence they may possibly present of crimes which they may have overlooked. Let ns make it the greatest offense against morals and manners to refuse respectful hearing to those who speak in the name of a more perfect justice, in the name of a better social order/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ It is well known that the great war in Europe would not have happened at all if it had not been for the governments. The people did not want the war and could hardly have been driven into it ut less their passions had been artificially roused and educated by governmental propaganda that was carefully prepared by experts in the art of lying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Governments, since the war, have been able to accomplish hut a small fraction of the things promised in the way of better housing and decrease of living expenses and it is hard to see how they can do so. It was the governments that inflated the currency so that all values have become upset. To be sure, they had to do it in order to pay their bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the things that brought unrest in the United States was the spectacle of the ease with which a United States senator could buy his way into that august body and the ease with which the whole matter could lie glossed over and hushed up. It is on a par with the government of Great Britain taking into the cabinet a man who had openly armed a great body of men and threatened a civil war unless he could have his own way regarding affairs in the North of Ireland. Such acts teach lessons in lawlessness to millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since, the war there seems to have been a great movement of governments toward the extremes of imperialism on the one hand or Bolshevism<sup>5</sup>',on the other, leaving the common man in-much the same frame of mind as a fire victim on the roof of a huge wooden hotel. The flames are all around him. Escape is cut off. He must take a choice between a ten-story jump to the granite paving stones of imperialism, or take a chance on riding to safety when the seething volcano of Bolshevism comes down to earth. Call tire hotel Civilization and we have the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since the war, in Hungary, under the League of Nation s imperialistic regime, five thousand Socialists were murdered in cold blood and forty -six thousand men and women were thrown info prison and internment camps. Pogroms were inaugurated against the Jews and flogging was set up as a common punishment for petty offenses. This was all done to establish again au imperialistic regime in that war-ridden land. If living in Hungary would you choose to line up with the ones engaged iu the flogging of women (we did some of that in the United States, in prisons iu the southern states within the past five years) or would you rather be flogged? There is small chance of a choice. Liberty and justice are anathema where imperialism lifts its head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It would seem as though there are some ‘drugs thr.t the government could still do for the w&lt; Ifate of the common people. For example, it could take over a few railroads that are not paying and run them in competition with all other railroads. It could take over a few mines and a few factories and a number of farms and it might learn something of advantage to the common people.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">odeut Blatchl-oud, in the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Clarion, </span><span class="font10">uttered a great truth when he said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">&quot;We’ shall never reach the happiness the king desires for us until we have civilized our religious leaders. Roman Catholics and Protestants both profess to be Christians, but they have hated each other </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and perse</span><span class="font8">cuted each other in a most un-Christian way </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for cen</span><span class="font8">turies.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Blatchford’s statement would have been more accurate had he said, <sup>K</sup>We shall never read’ll the happiness the king desires for us until we have converted our religious leaders and made Christians out of them”. The world is filled with so-called religion which is not religion at all, not Christianity at all; it is merely organized hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the war the so-called religious teachers vied with one another in teaching multitudes the antithesis of Christian principle and did it</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font10"> the name of God. Men were taught to kill who, before then, even if criminals, abhorred the idea of killing. Criminals were released from prison upon their promise that they would go forth to kill, and men of Christian principle who refused to kill under any circumstances were put into the cells they vacated, and all in the name of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font10"> comes out tvith a proposition that ministers of the gospel should work for a living during the week the same as other people, and the idea is a good one. More particularly it is a good one because, according to Dr. W. E. Biederwolf, of Chicago, in an address before the world’s sunday school congress at Tokio, in October last, twenty-five percent of the ministers of America have gotten so far away from real religion that they do not now maintain family worship in their own- homes. And if they no longer know how to worship God in their own homes, how can they hope to teach others to worship Him in any other place </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Len G. Broughton, in an address at the Atlanta Baptist Tabernacle, has given voice to the -thought that the time has now come for professed ministers of Christ to speak right out in meeting and tell the truth. They should have been doing that all along, and not wait for the Bible students to drive them into it. But hear Dr. Broughton:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We went in to save our necks. We couldn't keep out of it. But this should not blind us to the fact that this war, like all wars, was the result of commercial greed. And we wore not innocent of this sin. Look at the war. What nation is now better off than it was before the war? The world is worse off than before. When they stuck us preachers up on dry goods boxes to sell Liberty Bonds and Red Cross we should have told the truth. We and the church have sinned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Broughton is too late. The world at large knows that the professed ministers of the gospel are always on the side of the Devil in time of war and it has caused millions of people to lose all confidence in them. Emil Vandevelde, Chairman of the International Socialist Bureau, writing on this point says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Slowly but surely with the irresistible movement of a geological, subsidence, faith is waning among the international ^or'nks and even among peasants. One may safely assert^that about twenty years ago nearly every one held to some religious creed. Today the workmen who follow no particular creed number millions, and as their hopes of a heavenly kingdom dissolve, other hopes assert themselves with a growing intensity.”</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Judaism and Unrest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">F ALL the ridiculous reasons that have been assigned as causes for the world’s unrest, nothing has been quite as ridiculous as the propaganda P.’-nnced by Henry Ford which makes the Jev. ■ of the world, responsible for the French Revolution and everything that has happened since in Socialism, Bolshevism, Freemasonry and Sinn Feinism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The American Jewish Committee has answered these charges in a little pamphlet from which we extract the following items:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“During the war. by ,eervt agencies, a document variously called ‘The Procotols of the Elders of Zion’, &quot;The Protocols of the Alec-tings of the Zionist Men of Wisdom,’ and 'The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion,’ was clandestinely circulated, in typewritten form, among public officials and carefully selected civilians, for the purpose of giving rise to the belief that the Jews, in conjunction with Freemasons, had been for centuries engaged in a conspiracy to produce revolution and anarchy by means of which they hoped to attain the control of the world by the establishment of some sort of desi&gt;ctic rule.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;(1) The Protocols are a base forgery. There has never been an organization of Jews known as The Elders of Zion, or The Zionist Alen of Wisdom, or The Wise Alen of Zion, or bearing any other similar name. Thore has never existed a secret or other Jewish body organized for any puri&gt;o.«* such as that implied in The Protocols. The Jewi.-h people have never dreamed of a Jewish dictatorship, of a destruction of religion, of an interference with industrial prosperity, or of an overthrow of civilization. The Jews have never conspired with the Freemasons, or with any other Ixjdy. for any purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">•‘From the time of the de.-truction of the Temple at Jerusalem by Titus, the Jews have had no political state. For centuries they were forced to wander from land to land, to flee for refuge wherever they might find it against bitter persecution. They were pent up in gli'ltios, were deprived of even the shadow of civil or political rights, and were made the objects of every possible form of discrimination. It is little more than fifty years since the Jews of Western Europe became politically emancipated. Until the outbreak of the World WAr thb Jews of Eastern Europe, con.-tituting a majority-&lt;tf all the Jews of the world, were not even permitted to exercise the rights of citizenship in lands where they and their ancestors had dwelt for generations. The great mass of the Jews were hampered in every way in their efforts to earn a livelihood. Far from de-iring to govern the world, they were content with the opportunity to live. Numerically they constitute less than one percent of the population of the earth ; ami more than one-half of them are on the verge of starvation. The suggestion that, in their feebleness, they have been planning in secret conclave to seize absolute power and to dominate the ninety-nine ]&gt;er-cent of non-Jews upon th&lt;* globe is a ridiculous-invention than which even madness can conjure nothing more preposterous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘&quot;Where is the habitat of these so-called Elders of Zion, by whatever name they may be called? Who are these hidden sages? Whence do they come? What is the nature of their organization? The distributors of The Protocols arc silent on that subject. Whence come these pretended Protocols? TIurre have been various' versions. One Serge Nilus. of whose identity little is known, a Russian mystic and an ardent supporter of Czarism, claims to have received them in Bussin, in 1901, in manuscript form, from a Russian office-holder, who stated that the manuseript had been originally obtained by a lady, whose name is not given, and who, he said, obtained them in a mysterious way. In what language they were written is not stated. Where that manuscript now is does not appear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The Protocols as published bear no signatures. The identity of the Zionist representatives by whom they are claimed to have been signed is left untold. The location of the main Zionist office and of the secret vaults from which The Protocols were secretly removed remains a secret. It is, however, a matter of history that the first Zionist Congress was publicly-held by the Jews who came from various parts of Europe for the purpose of considering the misery of their brethren in Eastern Europe and of enabling them to find shelter in' the Holy Land. Theodor Herzl was a distinguished journalist, a man of true nobility of character. He presided at the Congress, all of whose deliberations were held in the light of day. The insinuation that there was a thirty-third, or any other degree, of initiation in this organization is merely a malicious effort to bring the Jews into parallelism with the Freemasons and thus to subject them to all the fanciful and fantastic charges that have front time to time been laid nt the door of Freemasonry, oblivious of the fact that fifteen Presidents of the United States, including Washington, and many of the leading statesmen of Europe and America, have been members of that order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">•‘Nilus and his associates belonged to the Russian bureaucracy. In 1905, through the Black Hundreds, that body sought in every way to erush the Jews and to prevent the liberalization of the government. The time was propitious for the perpetration of a political forgery bv a government that habitually resorted to the employment of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ai/ent* provocateurs,</span><span class="font8"> a government which only a few years later, against the protest of the enlightened clergy of the world, ineffectually sought to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">convict Mendel Beilin on the charge of ritual mu r tier. It is significant that one of his prosecutors has been active m distributing manuscript copies of The Protocols throughout the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Irrespective of this history, bristling with suspicion, an analysis of The Protocols shows that on their face thev are a fabrication and that they must have ema</span><span class="font8">nated from the bitter opponents of democracy. They </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font8">replete with cynical references to the French </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Revo</span><span class="font8">lution. and to the conceptions of liberty. etpiality and fraternity. They uphold privilege and autocracy. They </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">belittle etluearion. TJiey </span><span class="font8">condemn </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">religious liberty. </span><span class="font8">They assert that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">political </span><span class="font8">freedom </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is an idea </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font8">a fact, ami that the doctrine that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">government is nothing but a steward of the |»*op1c is a mere phrase. These are the very doctrines that one would expect from the protagonists of autocracy. Nothing can be more foreign to Jewish thought and aspiration than these brutal theories of reaction. That the Jews, whose verv life frsis been </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">prayer for the blessings of lilierty </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">.ami equality, should hold, them in contempt is unthinkable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“(?) The contention that the genuineness of The Protocols is established by the outbreak of Bolshevism in Russia twelve years after their publication, and that Bolshevism is a Jewish movement, is absurd in theory anti absolutely tintrue in fact. As well might it Is? said that a forged deed is genuine because twenty years after its date a relative of the person whose name is forged Is falsely charged with being a disturber of the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“To say that the Jews are responsible for Bolshevism is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">deliberate falsehood. The originators of Bolshevism were exclusively non-Jews. While it is true that there are Jews among tlie Bolshevists, notably Trotsky, they represent a small ‘fraction of the Jews and of the followers of Bolshevism. Leniue. who belonged to the Russian aristocracy ami has not a drop of Jewish Mood in liis veins, was the creator as lie has been the motive power of the Soviets. T&lt; hicberin. who has conducted their foreign affairs. Bucharin. Krassin and Kalinin, all 11011-Jews, are, with la-nine, the brains of the Coni-nu.nist Party.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The leading anti-Bolshevist newspapers, which of necc-ssijv are published outside of Russia, have Jews upon their editorial staffs. An overwhelming majority of Russian Jews have been mined by the coercive measures of the Soviets. They have submitted to the confiscation' of their property and are undergoing un-speakahle^hardships. The Orthodox Jews, whose numbers preponderate, remaining loyal to the faith of their fathers, regard the Bolsheviks as the enemies of all religion, and therefore, hold the doctrines of Bolshevism in abhorrence. With comparatively few exceptions the Jews are looked upon by the Bolsheviks as belonging to the hated bourgeaisc and as favoring capitalism. The Zionists, who constitute a numerous and important </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">element of the Jews of Rnsera, have been denounced by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary, and many of them have been east into prison and. threatened with </span><span class="font8">death—Zionists, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">we repeat, who are the followers of Herzl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“If </span><span class="font8">tlie Jews are to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">condemned </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">because of a Troitsky, who has never in the slightest degree concerned himself </span><span class="font8">with Judaism </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or the welfare of the Jews, then flu-re is not a people that has ever lived that might not </span><span class="font8">with equal right </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be condemned because </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">-its member</span><span class="font8">ship there were men who are alleged to have </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">advocated </span><span class="font8">hateful doctrines. The Jew has traditionally stood for religion, law. order, the family, and the right of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">prop</span><span class="font8">erty. It is. rherefore, the height of cruelty to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">charge </span><span class="font8">him with responsibility for Bolshevism, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">when its doc</span><span class="font8">trines, should they prevail, would inevitably </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">lead to </span><span class="font8">the destruction of Judaism. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is especially a brutal </span><span class="font8">charge when one considers till that the Jew has suffered from the oppressive nnd discriminatory laws of Russian autocracy.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">TT WILL be conceded by all that there never has been such a time of trouble and unrest on earth a* now. Contributing to tins unrest are,namely, the World War, Bolshevism, prohilt- . ition, employing class and profiteers versus wage earners, disturbed condition of finance, unwholesome, unrighteous and selfish political conditions, organized apostate ecclesiasticism operating under the name of Christian religion hut in fact a faithless religion, the education of the masses. Judaism, etc. Yet there is a reason why these things have all come at the same time. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nearly nineteen hundred years ago Jesus of Nazareth was asked the ijnestion what would he the evidence of the end of the world and the approach of His kingdom. Had His answer been written yesterday it could not have been more . appropriate to the conditions. He said that at that time there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, wifh perplexity; the sea [masses of humanity] and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coining upon the earth: for the powers of heaven shall he shaken. And tlien shall they see tire Son of man coining in a eloud with power and great glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The real reason why this general unrest in earth is so manifest is la-cause we have reached the end of the world. The old order is dead and is rapidly disintegrating. The prophet of Jehovah under inspiration wrote of this time, saying:</span></p>

Therefore, all hands shall lieeome weak, and every mortal’s heart shall melt: and they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall have throes, as a woman that travaileth: they shall wonder every man at his neighbor; . . . . . and I will visit on the world its evil, and on the wicked their iniquity; and I will, cause the ar-roganey of the proud to cease, and the haughtiness of the tyrants will I humble.

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE housing of the worker in thi« eomituy will- have much to do with this country’s attitude towards the Avar question of the future. Without giving the cost adequate consideration, both government and people are committed to scores of schemes- that can only be called fantastic. Calculations of the need name a total-6f 800;0W homes. If a competent building company could be found to undertake the country's requirements, the building alone would average $4,000 for every small house. But as the contracts will be distributed, the cost will be a great deal more, while to this- will have to he added the cost of the land. Front time to time estimates are accepted from $4,000 to $0,000; When these houses are let,, if they are to fulfill their philanthropic purpose, not more than a hundred dollars a year can be charged. This will mean that the cost will never be repaid. All the money raised will cost 6 percent.—This will mean a charge on each house, exclusive of repairs aud taxes, of about $280 per annum. If the scheme is generally adopted, the loans will run to $4,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Turn to tl« stock lists, and you see the old “Goschens’’ that once stood at 100 now marked at 44 or 45. Is it any wonder, when vast sums can be invested in guaranteed stocks at high interest? European statesmen are made aware, by this condition of things, that the providing of the vitals of war &lt;-au easier be supplied by eloquent politicians, fortified with whiskey, than by more prudent supporters having nothing save cheque books. Interviews with chequebook custodians will giv&lt;- responsible politicians an extraordinary interest in peace. Let us hope that a faithful press will soon glow with their appeals. If the London County Council has been a long tim&quot; in raising a portion of a housing loan„at a high interest, war-makers will ask themselves how long a thousand millions sterling. at a high rate of interest also, would require. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company Advertising (II)</span></h4>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font10">N The Goldex A&lt;e Number 29 we gave a review of Upton Sinclair's book, The Brass Check, showing why, among other things, a journal that tells the truth cannot hope to carry much profitable advertising. The Goldex Age has found this to be a fact,* and for that reason intends to discontinue all attempts to build up an advertising patronage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But apparently we came near getting some advertising business recently; at least we feel that a delicate suggestion was offered to us that we might have some if we would just keep still and be good, like all the other publications, far and near, that have taken the same kind of paregoric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seems that in Mr. Sinclair’s book he made certain reflections upon the motives of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company in their advertising campaign in the year 1919, alleging, in effect, that they had spent a million dollars a month upon newspaper advertising, with the object of closing the mouths of the newspapers so that they would not give favorable publicity to a bill that was then up before Congress for regulating the packing industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Golden Age Number 37, at their request, we printed a letter from Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company respecting the size of their advertising appropriations, with a reply thereto by Mr. Sinclair, all of which we have no doubt our readers found interesting. Apparently Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company thought that we did not intend to publish their letter; but they were wrong. Possibly they thought that we were bidding for some of their advertising; if so, again they were wrong. From our own point of view it was an incredible folly for them to have their advertising agents, the great J. Walter Thompson Company, of Chicago, write us, as they did, under date of February 19th, 1921, in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Will you please have someone cheek your files for a copy of ad^tter which was mailed to you on December 22nd. 1920, from the Commercial Research Department of .Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company, Union Stock Yards, Chicago, Illinois? The letter has been acknowledged and a promise made that it would be printed in </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Goldex Age. </span><span class="font8">We should appreciate your sending us clippings, or if the letter is not as yet in print, will you please let us know the date’of publication, so that we may write for a copy?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One can readily see that the effect of such a letter on some publishers would be to make them anticipate that a bending of their views io that of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company might conceivably result in their landing some advertising for hams, bacon, lard, soap, etc. Well! In this office the truth comes first, and so-called business success is the last consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In due time Golden Age Number 37 reached Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company; but for some reason or other they were dissatisfied, and we now have another letter from them which,at their request, we publish herewith. It is very interesting, as is also the article which follows it, from the pen of Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska. With the publication of these items we close this incident, as we do not wish to burden our readers with undue attention to one small item of the great drama now being played on the world’s stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We thank you for printing our letter of November 30th in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> of February 16th. We are sorry, however, that you apparently feel that our statement with regard to our advertising expenditure hns been sufficiently refuted by .Mr. Upton Sinclair’s letter of December 27th. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Sinclair quotes from the testimony of Mr. Francis J. Hency before the Senate Committee on Agriculture when he says that the accountants of the Federal Trade Commission had informed him that Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company had been spending an average of one million dollars </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">month for advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We fail to see how Mr. Heney, who had represented the Federal Trade Commission practically as a pro&lt;e-cuting attorney, can be accepted as an authority on this subject. The statement in our letter of November 30th that our advertising has averaged for the three years 1918, 1919, and 1920, considerably less than two million dollars a year is correct. At uo time has our advertising expenditure approached anything like one million dollars a month. The facts with respect to the amount spent by Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company on educational advertising were brought out in the same hearings referred to by Mr. Sinclair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These facts referred to above were given in the following affidavit which Mr. Swift presented:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">That I am of the opinion that the attitude of the con</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sumer toward the manufacturer of any product is a considerable factor in doTermining the purchase. The favorable attitude on the part of the buyer is an asset to the seller —and the constructive nature &lt;&gt;f the advertising done by Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. during V.»1t &nbsp;;-’s been considered not oidy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">from the standpoint of the publie having a lietter understanding of the fundamental facts of the business, but of creating a demand for Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co.'s products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That I am also of the opinion that all of the advertising of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co., of every nature, has assisted hi creating.a demand for Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co.'s products.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Mr. Sinclair begins his letter by wondering if the salaries of the Commercial Research Department are charged up to expenditures for advertising. These saiaries are not charged tip to advertising because a large part of the work of the department has nothing to do with this matter. Possibly part of the expenses might be charged to this account, although if the whole expense were charged to advertising it would make very little difference in ttie total. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As for Mr. Sinclair’s insinuation that conditions in the packing plants are unsanitary, we can only say that we invite inspection of our plants at any time.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sids Lights on the Packers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Senator Cjeorge</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Norris of Nebraska </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Printed in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Congressional Becobd,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> January 22, 1921)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the mt&gt; remarkable attempts to control the public sentiment of the country through the instrumentality of the public press has been going on for the last three or four years. The packers are not the only corporations engaged in this great undertaking. There are many other great corporations that are equally guilty. It is a nation-wide campaign to build up a reactionary sentiment in favor of the great corporations of the country. But in this article we are dealing only with the packers, and I confine myself in my comments to the part which they- have taken in this colossal undertaking. I do not want to be understood &quot;&nbsp;as claiming that all of this advertising was unnecessary or subject to criticism. Neither do 1 argue that liecause a newspaper accepts advertising it is necessarily controlled in its , editorial policy. The assertion is made, how-’ . - ever, that the advertising of the packers is far beyond any legitimate, fair, or even liberal allowance. for that purpose, and neither can &lt;&nbsp;there be ahy doubt but that some newspapers F are controlled in their editorial policy by the advertising end of the business. .Many others • remain silent in their editorial columns when they would otherwise condemn, if it were not for the oiling of the business machinery through advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There can be no doubt but that one of the objects of this campaign was to, mold public sentiment, and to close up the criticism that their acts would otherwise receive at the hands of newspapers. There was evidence developed upon the investigation to show that this was the real intent and purpose of a large portion of the advertising. The packers carry large page and half-page advertisements in all newspapers of the United States. No country paper was too small to be taken into consideration by them. Large display advertisements appeared in newspapers that had only two or three hundred subscribers. Moreover, the greatest of this advertising took place at a time when no advertising was needed in order to sell their products. It took place at a time when there was a shortage of production, when they were positively unable to supply the hungry with the food which-they desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have searched hundreds of country new's-paners coming from the smallest villages and have never yet found a paper that was not patronized by the packers in the way of advertising. I have a’ copy of a small newspaper</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">published way out on the frontier, in a small country town, that contains a half-page advertisement, signed by all five of the great packers, in which they make common cause to demonstrate that it would be difficult, indeed, for the country to exist without them..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On February 28, 1918, Swift &amp;&nbsp;€0. had a large display advertisement in practically all of the great newspapers of the United States, in which they devote the entire spaee to-a demonstration that the employes of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. are patriotic. Nothing is said in it about anything for sale and nothing is said in regard to a defense of any of the charges made by the Federal Trade Commission; but for some reason they seem to lx* imbued with the idea that some one had charged their employes with being unpatriotic, and they rush into print, wrap themselves in tlie American flag, and proclaim their patriotism from the housetops. During the war this was a favorite pastime for all profiteers. When a big corporation was about to cut a melon or a few millionaires were about to rob the Government in some unconscionable contract, they always made an attempt to distract attention by parading in public under the Stars and Stripes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the year 1918 Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. alone spent over $l.fi‘X).OfX) for advertising, and Mr. Swift himself admitted that they would spend $2,500,-(XX) in the year lf&gt;19. This would mean more than $2(M).(.W a month, about $7.tM)0 per day. Assuming that the other members of the ’Big Five' spend one half of what Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. spends, which everybody will admit is way below the actual fact, we find that the great packers on this basis spend i”ore than $8,500,000 annually for .idvrtising. This would be more than $1,090 </span><span class="font1">for </span><span class="font10">('very hour of the 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This cost only includes what is actually paid the newspapers and magazines. To keep the machinery going and to employ the necessary i.’.eit^tn. prepare the advertisements entails an additional expense of enormous amounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For rhp la&lt;t fifty years the packers have been . rowing in size, and as they have grown their disposition to avoid the law has increased with - their sirip. Ttjioy have been fined an innumerable number .yf times tor violation of the criminal statutes. Their attempt to control the prices of th'* country through their lavish expenditure of money is partially accounted for by their desire to conceal publicity of their transgressions. While they are fighting before a referee</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in Chicago with their employes, who are seeking . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">better working conditions, they are advertising </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font10"> 1 in Minneapolis the alleged advanced sanitary m 'I conditions of their packing establishments. By J their utilization of newspaper space they are 1 making it physically impossible for newspapers, .j | even if they desired to do so, to give proper &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark52"><span class="font10">publicity to the cases where they have been</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font10">found to have violated the law. They have 1 spent many thousands- of dollars in the use of ’ special trains to carry delegates to various&gt;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark54"><span class="font10">conventions where editors, particularly of farm</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark55"><span class="font10">journals, have been invited to be their guests for the real purpose of indirectly influencing • the news columns of such magazines and for the ~</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">purpose of suppressing from the people a ’ knowledge of their, shortcomings. The editor ' of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Nebraska Farmer</span><span class="font10"> could undoubtedly tell of such an invitation that he recently received <sup>; </sup>himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the 7th day of March, 1919, a Washington $ paper, on an inside page in a very inconspicu- j ous place, gave an account of the' trial and conviction of an agent of one of the ‘Big Five,’ who, in the city of Washington, had violated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. j</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark56"><span class="font10">the pure food law by selling catsup in original</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark57"><span class="font10">packages which were short in actual measure-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark58"><span class="font10">meat. It was shown at the trial that the cans</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark59"><span class="font10">of catsup were marked as containing 5 gallons</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark60"><span class="font10">each, and that upon actual measurement they</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark61"><span class="font10">were considerably short of that amount. One ' can was shown on actual measurement to be 2</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">quarts short. A third can was taken by. the officials and brought into court unopened, and * upon the trial of the ease the prosecution of- | fered to rest its entire case upon the unopened . J can. It was proposed that the can be opened &lt;&nbsp;and that if it was full measure the prosecution . would be dismissed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. |</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The great packing concern, however, declined | to accept this proposition. The result was that ; the agent making the sale was found guilty and</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark62"><span class="font10">■ lie was fined the enormous sum of $10. It is fair</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark63"><span class="font10">to assume that these cans were no exception</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark64"><span class="font10">to the general rule, and that this great coi-por- \ ation had sold thousands, perhaps tens of thou-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark65"><span class="font10">sands, of these same cans, all of which were</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark66"><span class="font10">undoubtedly short in measure. They had prob- . ■</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark67"><span class="font10">ably violated the pure food law in every city &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark68"><span class="font10">and&quot; hamlet in the United States, but so far as I have been able to learn this was the only place where they paid any penalty.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font10">No one will probably ever know just how much money has been spent by the packers to control legislation, to appoint officials, and to deceive the public. It is doubtful whether packers themselves could give this information correctly. For instance, the books of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. would nowhere show the payment of any salary to Mt. Logan.* There is no item anywhere which would indicate how much money was paid to ’Diamond T’.f It appears, for instance, ihat Mr. Veeder, the general attorney for Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co., was paid $71,000 in one year; but he was drawing a salary of less than $25,000. While he was getting a salary of about $25,000, his expenses amounted to about $50,000. Air. Swift seemed to be unable to tell definitely just what Mr. Veeder’s salary was. He was tmable to tell why they paid him over $70,000 when he was getting a salary of less than $25,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Both Armour and Swift have packing plants at Fort Worth. Together they own the stock-yards at that place. The evidence discloses that they loaned money to a man by the name of Armstrong, in Fort Worth, for the purpose of <sup>:</sup>iJaying an interest in a daily paper there, which had been advocating the control and regulation by the Government of the meat-packing business. They considered the paper unfriendly. Both Armour and Swift loaned money to Mr. Armstrong. It is noticeable that after the money was loaned and Armstrong became a part owner the policy of'the paper changed. In writing to the packers for a renewal of the loan, Mr. Armstrong called attention in this letter to the fact that he had gone into the newspaper business to be of service to Air. Armour and Mr. Swift, and also called attention to the editorial policy of the paper ‘before and after taking’. It is unnecessary to say that he had no difficulty in getting an extension of his loan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tlig men who were running this paper, however, were not aware that their competitor, the other daily newspaper published at Fort Worth, was likewise having its machinery oiled by packer money. The president of Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. in a letter asked his attorney whether they had better comply with the request of this other paper for a ‘donation’ of $1,200, which should be given ostensibly in return for a ‘page devoted to hogs and hog raising’. In this letter Mr. Swift called his attention to the fact that Armour &amp;&nbsp;Co. and the Stock Yards Co. of Fort Worth were each contributing like amounts. In addition to this, it seems that the editor of this paper was loaned $5,000 by Swift &amp;&nbsp;Co. He did not pay his interest promptly, and Mr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' Swift asked his attorney whether he thought it would antagonize this editor if he sent him a bill for the interest, saying that the editor also owed Armour &amp;&nbsp;Co. a like amount and he had paid the interest. The attorney, however, asked Air. Swift not to present any bill for interest at that time, because they had some important litigation pending in Texas, and he thought it would not be wise to ask for the payment of interest from the editor until this litigation had been disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AVe approach the domain of the great packers as a little child would approach a giant. At every step we are impressed with their wonderful power, their inexhaustible resources, the infinite network of connection with the most powerful financial institutions of the country. Their paid emissaries are’ in every locality. They are secretly entrenched in politics, in all kinds of business, and in nearly all the activities of human endeavor. To carry out their ends they have all kinds of instrumentalities. They are equipped to go into the church, and are likewise prepared to send the bum into the saloon. They have an army of highly paid, useless employes, who can give no honorable reason for their packer connections. Their agents are at the meeting of every legislature and in the Capital City at Washington. Their control of human food is so great that expense is a secondary consideration. They know that, after ail, all these expenses are paid and all this machinery is oiled by the consumers of the country. If their expenses increase, they have but to lower the price that they pay to the producer, or increase the pri«-e that they charge the consumer, or Itoth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">y ' T\URING the past few years, the value of research to almost all essential industries has been amply demonstrated. The. seieuti.i.-$ principles underlying and governing the work carried on in our gneat factories have been more and more faithfully applied: and in some ' instances cherished shibboleths have been ruth-'-lessly scrapped and cast aside, and applied</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">-s' science firmly established. One could cite many advances made in the non-ferrous (non-iron) industries, many of which are atted with that section dealing with the electro-deposition of metals. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The problems of corrosion are responsible for much research into, and advances made in the electro-plating and deposition of such elements as zinc, tin and nickel. Further, our engineering industries should materially benefit by the discovery of a nieaii” of depositing iron to almost any thickness, which can be case hardened. The enormous value of this will be obvi-&lt;nts when one recalls the large number of ex-<sub>r</sub> pensive-machined replacements worn in only a small section, ••specially in the motor industry. War-time necessity compelled scientific investi-. gation in this matter, to replace expensive internal gun-mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">World-wide i .-sity. interest and concentration have resulted in many improvements being made in the general art of the deposition of metals. The enormous amount of war re. search work done by many investigators in this • connection, has brought to light many ideas which will doubtless be developed from time to - time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The more expensive metals, gold and silver, howevfir, have not come into the limelight so much for obvious reasons, but much infornia-tion obtained when working on other metals will most assuredly be applicable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">t During certain investigations on the structures of silver deposits, the writer observed . • ' that in certain instances very fine deposits were obtained at an extraordinarily rapid rate. Further investigHtion revealed the fact that it was to a large extent due to the presence of a compound which was not looked upon with favor by many electro-platers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Barrelling, moving electrodes (both cathode and ai’ode) are processes calculated to increase the rate of deposition of silver, or in technical terms, to increase the cathode current density permissible, and are too well known for further mention. Flowing electrolytes or plating solutions are also conductive to higher cut&quot;- nts being used. None of these, however, are us yet available for the electro-deposition of silver on goods such as are to be found in hotel, restaurant and shipping outfits. The difficulties are found in the thick, heavy deposits required, and the large number of articles of irregular shapes and of different sizes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The silver deposit must also be firm, adherent, smooth and readily “finished”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Electro-plating in general, as operated with the double cyanide of silver and potassium bath appears to have had a natural maximum current density of from 3 to 4 amperes per square foot-of cathode surface. 'Further, microscopic examination of silver deposits obtained under these conditions, but with a higher current per unit area, shows the crystalline structure to lie such as to render the article less readily “finished” and with very high current densities impossible to obtain the characteristic mirrorlike sin face of finished silver goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The deposits obtained at an abnormally rapid r»te r ‘f'‘i ied to above, which were beautifully smooth and very readily ‘■'finished”, were always pi'-eipitated from silver-depositing l aths containing a very high percentage of potassium carbonate. The amount was considerably in ex</span><span class="font8">cess of </span><span class="font10">that found even in the oldest and most used solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In some cases, however, the deposit was altogether useless, although this compound (potassium carbonate) was present iit large quantities. I pon further investigation it was found that the plating solutions giving these unsatisfactory deposits at high current densities contained only normal quantities of potassium cyanide. On increasing the percentage of the latter compound, the plating solutions yielded a splendid smooth deposit at 8 amperes per square foot, this figure being 100 percent increase on the normal or natural maximum eur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">» &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rent density permissible in the ordinary' double</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ cyanide of silver and potassium plating bath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is obvious that with 100 percent increase ' in current per unit of cathode area, the time of immersion into the plating bath must be j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;halved to obtain an equal weight of deposit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In large plating establishments, the saving of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time thus effected is very important; and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">: . reduction on capital outlay is no small item when one considers the cost of installing even one extra plating-vat, and will doubtless be appreciated by those controlling large silverplating establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The process has been operated successfully,.« commercially, for a considerable period, and has deposited many thousand ounces of silver of the finest texture at_ double the normal rate.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Dentrifices and Pyrrohea</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font10">If AS been discovered that many denti-friees, widely advertised, widely used, and alleged to be excellent for the teeth and gums, are the principal cause of the disease pyorrhea, which is ravaging the world and causing millions of people to lose their teeth long before they ueed to do so. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These dentifrices have a gelatine base. With this is mixed some scouring material, a little perfumery, and a small quantity of germicide. When used, the mouth is rarely cleansed as completely afterward as it should be; and the gelatine, not being readily soluble in water, tends to cling to the teeth. After a little time the germicide in the composition loses its potency, and the gelatine which remains in the interstices of the teeth and upon the surfaces makes the most delightful brooding place for pyorrhea germs that could be devised. Consequence: the people that are most careful of their teeth, and most anxious to avoid pyorrhea, are the greatest victims of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Within the past few months it has been learned that some dentists were obtaining remarkable results in the treatment of eases of pyorrhea which were not too far gone; and now the secret is out. They have been having their ^patients brush their teeth with common baking soda, which is far and away the best dentifrice ever devised. Enough of it can be obtained for ten cents to last for a year or more. A good way is fi\st to moisten the brush and then use a dry spc^on to lift the powder from the can and drop if upon the brush. It is not unpleasant to use; and if the mouth is rinsed with water after using the result is very agreeable—the teeth, gums and interior of the mouth feeling peculiarly cool, comfortable and cleanly. Take the advice of The Golden Age; discontinue all other dentifrices, use the cheapest and best dentifrice in the world, common baking soda, and be forever free from pyorrhea.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">OBB </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">{Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, </span><span class="font10">August 26, 1920) reports a case as follows: E.’ C., aged twenty-six, had suffered from repeated attacks of infection of the mouth which always extended to the throat. These attacks were followed by mild rheumatic symptoms. Painting the gums with iodine or guaiacol would control the attack within, a few days and the rheumatism was relieved by the salicylates. These attacks occurred not once but many times. There was no evidence of a focus of infection about the teeth, and the case seemed a mystery which would be cleared up only by the removal of all of a set of perfectly good teeth. Finally it occurred to Cobb that the tooth brush might be the offender. This, by the way, was used religiously several times a day. Therefore, Cobb advised that the tooth brush be sterilized by soaking it in alcohol both before and after using. The brush, still wet with alcohol, was used to clean the teeth. This proved to be a solution of the mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He observes that all the germs common to the mouth can and do grow on the bristles, and the victim when next he uses the brush rubs into his gums a culture of the flora of his mouth. It is evident that the long-continued rubbing of such a culture into the tissues of the mouth, may have a serious effect.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Therapeutic Gazette,</span><span class="font10"> December 15, 1920.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">No difficulty, perhaps, more frequently presents itself to the inquiring mind than the questions, Why did God permit the present reign of evil/ Why. did He permit Satan to present ‘.the temptation to our first parents, after having created them perfect and upright ? Or why did He allow the forbidden tree to have a place among the good/ Despite all attempts to turn it aside, the question will obtrude it«elf: Could not God have prevented all possibility of man’s fall ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The difficulty undoubtedly arises from a failure to comprehend the plan of God. God could have prevented the entrance of sin, hut the fact that He did not should be sufficient proof to ns that its present permission is designed ultimately to work out some greater good. Gods plans, seen in their completeness, will prove the wisdom of the course pursued. Some inquire, Could not God, with whom all things are possible, have interfered in season to prevent the fuUaeebmplislnnent of Satan’s design! Doubtless He could; but such interference would have prevented the accomplishment of His own purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">God’s purpose was to make manifest the perfection, majesty and righteous authority of His law, and to prove both to men and to angels the evil consequences resulting from its violation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides, in their very nature some things are impossible even with God: as the Scriptures state, it is &quot;impossible for God to lie”.(Hebrews 6:18) &quot;He cannot deny himself.&quot; (2 Timothy 2:13) lie cannot do wrong, and therefore He could not choose any but the wisest and best plan, for introducing His creatures into life, even though our short-sighted vision might for a time fail to discern the hidden springs of infinite wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The Scriptures declare that all things were created for the Lord’s pleasure (Revelation 4:11)—without doubt, for the pleasure of dispensing His blessings and of exercising the attributes of His glorious being. And though, in the working out of His benevolent designs, He permits evil and evil-doers for a time to play an active part, yet it is not for evil’s sake, nor because He is in league with sin; for He declares that He is &quot;not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness”. (Psahu 5&gt;4) Though opposed to evil in every sense, God permits (i.e., does not hinder) it for a time, because His wisdom sees a way in which it may be made a lasting and valuable lesson to His creatures.</span></p>

It is to this moral sense'that God always appeals to prove Uis righteousness pr justice; and by the same moral sense Adam could discern sin, or unrighteousness, to lie evil, even before he knew all its consequences. The lower orders of God’s, creatures are not endowed with this moral sense. A dog has some intelligence, but not to this degree, though he may learn that certain actions bring the approval and reward of his master, and certain others his disapproval. lie might steal or take life, but would not be termed a sinner; or ho might protect property and life, but would not he called virtuous— because he is ignorant of the moral quality of his actions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">God could have made mankind devoid of ability to discern between right and wrong, or able only to discern and to do right; but to have made him so would have been to make merely a living machine, and certainly not a mental image of his Creator. Or He might have, made man perfect and a free agent, as He did, and have guarded him from Satan’s temptation. In that ease, man’s experience being limited to good, he would have been continually liable to suggestions of evil from without, or»to Ambitions from within, which would have made the everlasting future uncertain, and an outbreak of ^obedience and disorder might always have Ken a possibility; besides which, good would &lt;-.r have- lici-n so highly appreciated except by its contrast with evil.</span></p>

Expelled • from Edon and deprived of fellowship with ’ Himself, God let them exi&gt;erieiiee sickness, pain and death, that they might thus forever know ■ evil and the inexpediency and exceeding sinfulness of sin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. <sup>r</sup> .</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">213.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> What were the most important </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">elements </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of Adam's likeness to his Creator?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">The moral sense, or judgment of right and_ wrong, and the liberty to use it, which Adam possessed, were important features of his like- « .ness to God. The law of right and wrong wa 4 written in his natural constitution. It was a part of his nature, just as it is a part of the i divine nature. But let us not forget that this image or likeness of God, this originally law-inscribed nature of man, has lost much of its j clear outline through the erasing, degrading ' influence of sin; hence it is not now what it was in the first man. Ability to love implie ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;1 ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ability to hate; hence we may reason that tin* ia Creator could not make man in His own like-ness, with power to love and to do right, without the corresponding ability to hate and ! to do wrong. This liberty of choice, termed free moral agency, or free will, is a part of man’s original endowment; and this, together with the full measure of his mental and moral faculties, constituted him an image of his Creator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Today, after six thousand years of degradation, so much of the original likeness has been erased by sin that we are not free, being bound, to a greater or less extent, by sin and its entailments. so that sin is now more easy, mid therefore more agreeable, to the fallen race -than is righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IF OPPORTUNITY TO SIN HAD NEVER BEEN PERMITTED THERE WOl’I-D BE NO VIRTUE IN RIGHT DOING</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">214.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Why did not Jehovah git's Adam some ririd impression of the results of sin instead of permitting him to suffer the actual experiences of evil!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">That God could have given Adam sueh a vivid impression of the many evil results of sin as would have deterred him from it we need not question, but we believe that God foresaw . that an actual experience of the evil would lie the surest ami most lasting lesson to serve man eternally: and for that reason God dial not prevent hut permitted man to tafie his choice, and to Feel the consequences of evil. Had. opportunity to sin never Ix^en permitted man could not have resisted it, consequently there would have been neither virtue nor merit in his right-doing. God seeketh such to worship Him as worship in spirit and in truth. He desires intelligent and willing oliedience, rather than ignorant, mechanical service. He already had in Alteration inanimate mechanical agencies accomplishing His will; but His design was to . make a nobler thing, an intelligent creature in - His own likeness, a lord for earth, whose loyalty and righteousness woTdd lie based upon an appreciation of right and wrong, of good and evil. -</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The principles of right and wrong as principles, have always existed and must always exist; and all perfect, intelligent creatures in God’s likeness must be free to choose either, though the right principle only will forever continue to lx* active. The Scriptures inform us that when the activity of the evil principle has been permitted long enough to accomplish God’s purpose it will forever cease to be active, and that all who continue to submit to its control shajl forever cease to exist. (I Corinthians 15:25, 2(&gt;; Hebrews 2:14) Bight-doing and right-doers, alone, shall continue forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Bnt the question recurs in another form: Could not man have been made acquainted with evil in some other way than by experience? There are four ways of knowing things; namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">537 &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">by intuition, by observation, hy experience, and by information received through sources ac- -cepted as positively truthful. An intuitive knowledge would lx‘ a direct apprehension, without the process of reasoning or the necessity’ for proof. Such knowledge belongs only ’ to the divine Jehovah, the Eternal Fountain of all wisdom and truth, who of necessity ami in the very nature of things is superior to all ? His creatures. Therefore, man’s knowledge of -good and evil could not be intuitive. Man's knowledge might have come by’ observation but in that event there must needs have lieen some exhibition of evil and its results for man &quot;to observe. . This would imply the permission of evil somewhere, among some lieings, and why not as well among num, and upon the eartli, ’ ax among others elsewhere ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font10">Why should not man be the illustration, and get his knowledge by practical experience.’ It is so; man is gaining a practical experience, and is furnishing an illustration to others as well, being “made a spectacle to angels”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Adam already had a knowledge of evil hy information, but that was insufficient to restrain him from trying the experiment. A&lt;}am anil Eve knew God ax their Creator, and hence as the one who had the right to control and ' direct them; and God had said of the forbidden tree, &quot;In the day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die”. They had, therefore, a theoretical knowledge of evil though they had never . observed or experienced its effects. Consequently, they did not appreciate their Creator's loving authority’ and His beneficent law, nor the dangers from which He'thereby proposed to protect them. They therefore yielded to the ’ temptation which God wisely permitted, tlie ultimate utility of which His wisdom had traced.</span></p>

The Scriptures tell the simple story of how the woman, the weaker one, was deceived.</span></p>

Her experience and acquaintance with <sub>w</sub>God were even more limited than Adam's, for he was created first, and God had directly communicated to him before her creation the knowledge of the penaltj' of sin, while Eve probably received her information from Adam. When she had partaken of the fruit, she, having put confidence in Satan’s deceptive misrepresentation, evidently did not realize the extent of the transgression, though probably she had misgivings and slight apprehensions that all was not well. But, although deceived, Paul says she was a transgressor. though not so culpable as if she had transgressed against greater light. ,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">2'20. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What teas theseverity of the temptation which led to Adam's transgression? And why was he more culpable than Eve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Adam, we are told, unlike Eve, was not deceived (1 Timothy 2:14), hence he must have transgressed with a fuller realization of the sin, and with the penalty in view, knowing certainly that he must die. We can readily see what was the temptation which impelled him thus recklessly to incur the pronounced penalty. Bearing in mind that they were perfect beings, in the mental and moral likeness of their &lt;Maker, the godlike element of love was displayed with marked prominence by the perfect man toward his beloved companion, the perfect woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Realizing the sin and fearing Eve’s death, and thus his loss (and that without hope of recovery, for no such hope had been given), Adam, in despair, recklessly concluded not to live without her. Deeming his own life unhappy and worthless without her companionship, he willfully shared her act of disobedience in order to share the death penalty which lie probably supposed rested on her. Both were ‘ in-the* transgression’’, as the Apostle shows. (Romans 5:14^ 1 Timothy 2:14) But Adam and Eve were one and jiot “twain”; hence Eve shared the sentence which her conduct helped to bring upon Adam.—Romans 5:12, 17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GODS PitRMI^SIOM OF EVIL IX NO WAY INCRIMINATES HIM AS THE AUTHOR OF EVIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">221. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How will Jehovah's permission of evil ultimately result in grind? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God not only foresaw that man, having been given freedom of choice, would through lack</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">of full appreciation of sin and its results accept it; but He also saw that, becoming acquainted « with it, man would still choose it, because that 1 , acquaintance would so impair his moral nature ’ that evil would gradually become more agree- A able and more desirable to him than good. ■ i '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Still, God designed to permit, evil, because, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">having the remedy provided for man’s release &nbsp;&nbsp;S</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">from its consequences, He saw that the result ' would be to lead him, through experience, to a full appreciation of “the exceeding sinfulness of sin’’ and of the matchless brilliancy of virtue in contrast with it—thus teaching him the more to love and honor his Creator, who is the source and fountain of all goodness, and forever to * shun that which brought so much woe and misery. So the final result will be greater love for ■ God and greater hatred of all that is opposed to His will, ami consequently the linn establish-inent in everlasting righteousness of all such as sb-dl profit by the lessons God is now teaching through the permission of sin and correla- Ml tive evils. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">222. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Does the fart that God lias permitted sin prove that Hr is the author of sin'? What two ransom-denying _</span><span class="font10"> j </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">theories have resulted from this erroneous charge against the Almighty? .And how does such reasoning ignore ; man's noblest quality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, a wide distinction should be observed between the indisputable fact that God has per- • mitted sin and the serious error of some which charges God with being the author and instigator of sin. The latter view is both blasphemous and contradictory to the facts presented in the Scriptures. Those who fall into this error generally do so in an attempt to find another plan 2* of salvation than that which God has provided through the sacrifice of Jesus as our ransomprice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If they succeed in convincing themselves and ; others that God is responsible for all sin and wickedness and crime and that man as an innocent tool in His hands was forced into sin. ” then they have cleared the way for the theory that not a sacrifice for our sins, nor mercy in any form, was needed, but simply and only justice. Thus, too, they lay a foundation for another part of their false theory, viz., univer</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. salism, claiming that as God caused all the sin and wickedness and crime in all, He will also ■ cause the deliverance of all mankind from sin' and death. And reasoning that God willed and caused the sin, and th;,t none could resist Him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">so they claim that wlren He shall will righteousness all will likewise be powerless to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But in all such reasoning man’s noblest quality, liberty of will or choice, the most striking feature of his likeness to .ds Creator, is entirely set aside; and man is theoretically degraded to a mere machine wliieh acts o.Jy as it is acted upon. If this wen; the case, man, instead of being the lord of earth, would be inferior even to insects; for they undoubtedly have a will, or power of choice. Even the little ant has been -T given a power of will which man, though by his greater power he may oppose and thwart, cannot destroy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">2.23.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> What two texts of Scripture are used to support the theory that- (rod is the author of sin?</span><span class="font8"> IVArit i.s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the distinction'betirrra .tin and evil?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Two texts of Scripture (Isaiah 45: 7 and Amos 3:6) are used to sustain this theory, but by a misinterpretation of the word evil in both texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sin is always an evil, but an evil is not always a sin. An earthquake, a conflagration, a flood or a pestilence would be a calamity, an - .evil; but none of these would lie sins. The word evil in the texts cited signifies calamities. The same Hebrew word is translated affliction in Ps</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font10"> 34:19; 107:39; Jeremiah 48:16; Zechariah 1:15. It is translated trouble in Psalm 27:5; 41:1; 88:3; 107:26; Jeremiah 51:2; Lamentations 1: 21. It is translated calamities, adversities and distress in 1 Samuel 10:19; Psalm 10:6; 94:13; 141: 5; Ecclesiastes 7:14; Xehemiah 2:17. And the same word is in very many places rendered harm, mischief, sore, hurt, miser}’, grief and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Isaiah 45: 7 and Amos 3: 6 the Lord would remind Israel of His covenant made with tliem as a nation—that if they would obey. His laws He would bless them and protect them from die calamities common to the world in general; hut th^t if they would forsake Him He would bring calamities (evils) upon them as chastisements. See Deuteronomy 28:1-14, 15-32; Leviticus 26:14-16; Joshua 23:6 -11, 12 -16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When calamities came upon them, however, ’key were inclined -to consider them as accidents and not as chastisements. Hence God sent them ■ '&quot;id through the prophets, reminding them of ’’.•'ir covenant and telling them that their -lamities were from Him and by His will for their correction. It is absurd to use these texts to prove God* the author of sin, for they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font10">not at all refer to sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO HAVE FORCED MAN INTO SIN WOULD HAVE </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BEEN </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">INCONSISTENT WITH GODS RIGHTEOUS </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHABACTEB</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">224.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Although, God has absolute pourer to force man into sin or righteousness, trhg would such a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">course be </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a moral impossibility?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">True, God has power to force man into either sin or righteousness, but His Word declares that He has no such purpose. He could not consistently force man into sin for the same reason that &quot;he cannot deny himself”. Such a course would be inconsistent with His righteous character, and therefore an impossibility. And He seeks the worship and love of .only such as • worship Him in spirit and in truth. To this end He has given man a liberty of will like unto His own, and desires him to choose righteousness. Man’s being permitted to choose for liimself led to his fall from divine fellowship, favor and blessings into death. By his experience in siu and death man learns practically what God offered to teach him theoretically without his experiencing sin and its results.</span></p>

And how dtd Jehovah's foreknowledge of what,man would do operate in the latter's favor?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">God’s foreknowledge of what man &quot;would do is not used against him as an excuse for degrading him to a mere machine-being; on the contrary, it is used in man’s favor; for God, foreseeing the course man would take if left free to choose for himself, did nothinder him from &quot;tasting sin and its bitter results experimentally, but began at once to provide a means for his recovery from his first transgression by providing a Redeemer, a great Savior, able to save to the uttermost all who would </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">return unto God </span><span class="font10">through Him. To this end— that man might have a free </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font10"> and yet be enabled to profit by his first failure in its misuse, in disobedience to the Lord’s will—God has provided not only a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ransom,</span><span class="font10"> for all. but also that a knowledge of the opportunity thus offered of reconciliation with Him&gt;.4f rl-&quot;ll lw testified to all in due time.— 1 Timothy 2:3-6.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font10">The severity of the penalty was not a display of hatred and malice on God’s part, but the necessary and inevitable final result of evil, which God thus allowed man to see and feel. God can sustain life as long as He sees fit, even against the' destructive power of actual evil; but it would be as impossible for God to sustain such a life everlastingly as it is for God to lie. That ■ is, it is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">morally impossible.</span><span class="font10"> Such a life could only become more and more a source of unhappiness to itself and others; therefore, God is too good to sustain an existence so useless and injurious to itself and others, and, His sustaining power being withdrawn, destruction, the natural result of evil, would ensue. Life is a favor, a gift of God, and it will be continued everlastingly only to the obedient.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">No</span><span class="font10"> injustice has been done to Adam's-posterity in not affording them each an individual trial. Jehovah was in no sense bound to bring us into existence; and, having brought us into being, no law of justice or equity binds Him to perpetuate our being everlastingly, nor even to grant us a trial under promise of everlasting life if obedient. Mark this point well. The present life, which from the cradle to tlfc tomb is but a process of dying is, notwithstanding all its evils and disappointments, a boon, a favor, even if there were no hereafter. The large majority so esteem it, the exceptions (suicides) being comparatively few; and these our courts </span><span class="font8">of justice </span><span class="font10">have repeatedly decided to be mentally unbalanced, as otherwise they would not thus cut themselves off from the present blessings.

<p><span class="font10">Many have imbibed the erroneous idea that God placid otjr race on trial for life with the alternative of eternal torture, whereas nothing of the kind is even hinted at in the penalty.

<p><span class="font10">Jesus, the undefiled, the sinless one, was a com* plete settlement toward Goitof rhe sin of Adam. As one man had’sinned, and all in him had shared his curse, his penalty, so Jesus, having paid the penally of- that one sinner.

<p><span class="font10">After fully purchasing the lives of Adam and his race, Christ offers to adopt as His seed, His children, all of Adam s race who will accept the terms of His New Covenant and thus by faith . and obedience come fully into the family of (rod ami receive everlasting life. Thus the Redeemer will &quot;see </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Itix need</span><span class="font10"> [as many of Adam's seed as will accept </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">adoption,</span><span class="font10"> upon His conditions] and prolong his days [resurrection to a higher than litfman plane being granted Him by the Father as a reward for His obedience]/’ and all in the most unlikely way—by the sacrifice of life and posterity. And thus it is written: &quot;As all in Adam die, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ecen so</span><span class="font10"> all in Christ shall be made alive.”—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Corrected translation,</span><span class="font10"> 1 Corinthians 15:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The injury we received through Adam's fall (we suffered no injustice) is, hy (lull’s favor, to be more than offset with favor through Christ; and all will sooner or later (in God’s &quot;due time ’) have a full opportunity to be restored to the same standing that Adam enjoyed before he sinned.^Jiose who do not receive a full knowledge and, by faith, an enjoyment &lt;&gt;f this favor of God in the present time (and such are the groat majority, including children and heathen) will assuredly have these privileges in the next age, or &quot;world t6 come,’’ the dispensation or age to follow thi* present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Luder the Covenant of Grace members of tlie-ehurch (during the gospel age) have had the righteousness of Christ imputed to them by faith to make tip their unavoidable deficiencies through the weaknesses of the flash. Divine grace will also operate toward &quot;whosoever will” of the world during the Millennial age. Not until physical perfection is reached (which will he the privilege of all before the elose of the Millennial age) will absolute moral perfection be expected. That new trial, the result of the ransom and the New Covenant, will differ from the trial iu Eden in that in it the acts of each &lt;”vi will affect only his own future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AS TO THE SECOND CHANCE THEORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">234. ll’eidd </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not this mean a second chance for some of the race to gain ei erlnstiny life? .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">But would not this be giving some of the race a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font10"> chance to gain everlasting life</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font10"> We answer: The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font10"> chance for everlasting life was lost for himself and all of his race, &quot;yet in his loins”, by father Adam's disobedience. Under that original trial &quot;condemnation passed upon all men”; and God's plan was that through Christ’s redemption-sacrifice Adam, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font10">who lost life in his failure<sup>1</sup>, should, after having tasted of the exceeding sinfulness of sin and felt the weight of sin’s penalty, be given opportunity to turn unto God through faith in the Redeemer. If any one chooses to call this a “second chance” let him do so; it must certainly be Adam's second chance, and in a sense at least it is the same for all the redeemed race, but it will be the first </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">individual</span><span class="font10"> opportunity of his descendants, who, when born, were already under condemnation to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Call it. what wo please, the facts are the same, viz.: all wore sentenced to death because of Adam’s disobedience, and all will enjoy (in the </span><span class="font8">.11 ilMinial age) a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hill opportamlty</span><span class="font10"> to gain everlasting life under the favorable terms of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">New Covenant. This, as the angels declared, is &quot;good, tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people”. And, as the Apostle declared, this grace of God—that our Lord Jesus “gave himself a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ransom for all”—</span><span class="font10">must be “testified” to all “in due time”. (Romans 5:17-19; 1 Timothy 2:4-6) Men, not God, have limited to the gospel age this chance or opportunity of gaining life. God, on the contrary, tells us that the gospel age is merely for the selection of the church, the royal priesthood, through whom, during a succeeding age, all others shall he brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth and granted full opportunity to secure everlasting life under the New Covenant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY IS THE EXTERMINATION OF T.VIT, ACCOMPLISHED BY SO PECULIAR AND CIRCUITOUS A METHOD?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">235.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> is the special advantage of the divine arrangement?</span><span class="font8"> ll'fty </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not give mankind an individual trial now' Is it probable that any would be found perfectly obedient?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">But what advantage is there in the method pursued! Why not give all men an individual chance for life now. at once, without the long process of Adam's trial and condemnation, the share by his offspring in his condemnation, the redemption of all by Christ's sacrifice, and the n-'w offer to all of everln'diii'Y I<sup>:</sup>fe upon the New Covenant conditions ? If evil must lie permitted because of man's free moral agency, why is its extermination accomplished by such a peculiar and circuitous method? Why allow so much misery to intervene, and to come upon many who will ultimately receive the gift of life as obedient children of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AL! that is the point on which interest in this subject centers. I lad God ordered differently the propagation of our species, so that children would not partake of the results of parental sins—weaknesses, mental, moral and physical— and had the Creator so arranged that all should have”n favorable Edenic condition for their testing, and that transgressors only should, be condemned and &quot;cut off”, how many might we presume would, under all those favorable conditions, Ije found worthy and how many unworthy o| lift* ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the one instance of Adam be taken as a criterion (and he certainly was in every respect a sample of perfect manhood), the conclusion would be that none would have been found perfectly oliedient and worthy; for none would pos</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sess that clear knowledge of and experience &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">with God which would develop in them full &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">k</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">confidence in* His laws, beyond their personal • j judgment. We are assured that it was Christ’s knowledge of the Father that enabled Him to l. trust and obey implicitly.—Isaiah 53:11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,■</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">y^HAT is it about that simple word that touches a so deep and common chord? Is it not the fact that it embqdies the thoughts of life and love and happiness ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Home may lie in the past for you, a vision around which cluster all your childish memories; or, having, missed a home of your own in youth, you may have worked to mold one out of willing but less plastic grown-up hearts. Maybe you have succeeded, or maybe your hearthstone has been rudely torn away by the hurricane of death or broken into fragments by things worse than death. Perhaps you have some sweet hope of home still fondly hidden from public eyes. But no matter what kind of sentiment the word home may call forth in you, whether it be the gulp of tender emotion or the sigh of cynical regret, you still have the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">desire</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> for home, the desire to live, to love, to be loved, to be happy. And that is no unreasonable desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How and where will this universal desire find satisfaction ? The Bible alone gives sufficing answer. It tells us that God has designed the earth to be man’s everlasting homestead; it tells that, when the present drunken debauch of the world’s Saturday night is over, mankind shall be delivered from the maladjustments which now wound it and be guided by Messiah into a state where everyman will dwell in quietness, safety, and assurance in his own home forever.</span></p>

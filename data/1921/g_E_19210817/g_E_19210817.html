<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ENJAMIN FRANKLIN, the discoverer of electricity, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The rapid progress of true science occasions my sometimes regretting that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the heights to which may be carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Agriculture may diminish its labor, and double its produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">-f “All diseases may, by 'sure means, be prevented and cured, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not excepting that of old age, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and our lives lengthened, at pleasure, even beyond the antediluvian standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Oh, that moral science were in a fair way to improvement, that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings would at length learn what they now improper* ly call humanity!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The foregoing statement of Franklin was a prophetic inspiration based on statements in the Bible and his knowledge of physical phenomena; and we are now near the time of the fulfillment of his forecast &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SYNOPSIS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The following is a presentation of some of the outstanding facts that prove that present human life is grossly unnatural—abnormal life, due to the unfinished state of the planet on which we live and to other devitalizing influences incident to the creative process going on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That man’s physical powers, mental faculties, moral perceptions and judgment are either 'dormant, relatively dead, or so warped by his physical imperfection that he is incapable of sound reasoning and successful government.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That man has formulated the false theory • that a selfish scramble for persona! oomfort, s by which the weaker is crowded to the wall by the stronger, is true civilization^ and that the government which man has based on this false theory, now threatens to collapse -under the-weight of its defects, as the complioated problems of increasing population multiply, and completely to destroy the whole system, falsely called civilization, under an evil spiritual administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That this, in the creative process, is merely the working of divine economy, which utilizes all things, in attaining its end, perfection; and that when the end of one stage of the process comes, an advanced stage in the process takes its place: and that we are now at the end of one stage and the beginning of a new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That the earth is now nearing completion, and that a physical condition nearer perfect is about to produce a human physical condition nearer perfect and in the end absolutely per- • feet. Perfect — normal — human life, perfect mental faculties, moral perceptions and judgment are due to follow. Real civilization and a righteous government will then prevail, through the administration of divine power, when physical and moral perfection will go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This presentation is confined, mainly to a consideration of man's physical life as distinguished from his mental and moral being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The theory that man was created to be a spiritual being is not supported by any Biblical statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Christian church is an order created entirely independent of the human race, though selected from it; hence its name “new creatin'*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The special doctrines of the Christian church, . as presented by'Jesus, its founder, have no ap-; plication to the human race as such, but only / to a special few who are called out to form a new administrative order, a new creation, en-entirely distinct from the human creation. Strangely enough, the rationale of the Christian church has been entirely misunderstood by most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A critical examination of Biblical statement shows that the human race was created to remain a human race to all eternity, instead of, as most people believe, eventually to become-spirit beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">While it is true that the Bible teaches that mankind cannot have normal life or continued life without recognizing and obeying Christ’s-, commands, yet but very few are accepted as real member? of His administrative body, the Christian church. They only, with a relatively . few other human beings, will become spirit beings; all others will remain human, with fleshly bodies as we now see them. There is* no condemnation of them because they would not respond to the invitation to become members of the Christian church. They only miss an inconceivably high honor and life on the divine plane: the same in a limited sense, as if -the President of the United States should offer a citizen a position in his cabinet and the citizen declined. He would not lose his rights as a private citizen, though he would lose the high honor of being a cabinet officer. He would be obliged to obey the laws enforced by the chief executive and the officials of the administration, but no more. If, however, he accepted the position of cabinet officer and on account of disloyalty to the President was forced to resign, he would be disgraced; and if disloyal to the United States he might be imprisoned or even executed. That is the position in which there have been billions of nominal church members who did accept the offer of a position in the cabinet of Jesus Christ, the kingdom of heaven, but proved disloyal. No Biblical statement indicates that they will be eternally tormented, but they are liable to become extinct in death if their offense was willfully criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The reason why the rationale of the Christian church has come to be misunderstood is that nearly all have erroneously concluded that its special doctrines were binding upon all, whereas they were mandatory only upon those who answered the call, accepting the offer of a * position in the administrative body of Jesus Christ Billions answered the call. They wanted the high honor; but very few, however, have fulfilled the conditions. “Every tree that brings eth not forth good fruit is hew down and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cast into the firs.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord! Lord! shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father.”—Matthew 7:19-21;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Only those who are faithful to Christ's teaching, even until and unto death, can have this high honor. The invariable conditions are that they must suffer, as He suffered, contempt, scorn, hatred, ostracism, persecution and death —if need be,‘even a violent death—even burning at the stake or crucifixion, as He suffered on account of His loyalty to Christian Truth. Jesns said these were the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">invariable</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> conditions; and all down the gospel age these have been the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">invariable</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> experiences of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Christians because they were loyaL Most of the members of the great, popular, fashionable Christian * churches have answered the call, but would not-pay the price—would not fulfill the conditions. They have been disloyal </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nominal</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Christians— “tares” dominating these nominal Christian church systems; and the loyal Christians were obliged to flee out of them, and were persecuted and tortured for doing so. The process still continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">These so-called Christian church systems either joined with, became a part of, unchristian governments, or indirectly backing up and supporting them, have endorsed and helped to support the lust for empire and wars of these unchristian governments, killing millions of people, thus- grossly disobeying the teachings of “Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">These great so-called Christian church systems could have entirely prevented the&gt;e wars, had .they been ready to suffer unto death rather than violate Christian principle and engage in war. But in most cases they have even bwm prominent, through their clergy, in making the wars popular and in urging the people to war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A final analysis of Biblical statement and a study of the signs of the times, as forecasted by Jesus, show that the new creation, the true Christian church, is now about complete and that the time has come- for the new administration of Jesus Christ to take office. The kingdom of heaven is being instituted, and the preparatory work of cleaning away the old evil administration of human affairs,including nominal Christian organizations, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;cast into the fire,&quot; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is now going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The prevailing idea is that the kingdom of heaven is a far-off, mysterious something that has nothing to do with the practical human affairs; whereas, it is clearly shown, when we critically analyze Biblical statement, that it has </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to do with practical human affairs: that its first work is to restore and help the human race back to that perfection lost by Adam: that mankind are to have eternal life right here on earth as indicated in our Lord's prayer: “May thy&quot; kingdom come and thy will be done </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">o\earth</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> as it is done in heaven&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us now proceed to examine what God’s will is on earth regarding the human race and the physical conditions on which it depends for its life, as indicated by the laws that govern the physical world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ARGUMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Any student of the rocks, strata, and fossils of the earth knows that it has been for long ages, and continues to be, in the process of creation; that it is not quite complete, though nearing completion, being now nearly at the end of the ice age and at the beginning of the final stage of completion. Under the incomplete conditions that have prevail: d, normal life has been impossible. This must .l&gt;e self-evident to all who study, and reason upon the matter; for to attain to perfect vegetable and animal, including human, physical life, perfect physical </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conditions</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> must prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Have we any standard by which to compare? If not, how can we arrive at a reliable conclusion as to what a perfect earth is? Who has ever seen a perfect earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Geologists know that there was a time when neither vegetable nor animal life was possible upon the earth, and it is possible to trace the earth’s development up to the time when it was possible for vegetable and animal life to exist upon the earth, also its development by stages up to its present condition. And by physical law, which governs all material life and matter, we can determine the final stage of its completion, the approximate time when it will be complete, and the effect of that completion on vegetable and animal life, including human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For instance, we know that in the arctic-regions where there is a vast area covered with ice all, the year around, there was once tropical vegetation upon which animals fed that were larger than any now living, and that there are coal seams in the polar regions that ages ago could have been laid down only from great, forests of vegetation. This proves that in the process of earth’s creation, there has been a period when part of it has been as perfect as it all will be when completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This proves also that the plan or process of planetary creation involves long periods of seeming reaction or retrogression, followed in turn by long periods again of still further advancement nearer perfection. This seems to be the law of planetary creation—now advancing, now retreating and then-advancing again; and all life upon the earth has followed this creative law. In fact, it seems to be a law of all creation so far, whether physical or spiritual, animate or inanimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The ice-caps in the polar regions not only determine the conditions of all vegetable and animal life there, but are literal refrigerators of the whole earth, keeping life upon it in a semi-dormant, refrigerated condition in which there has been no substantial progress since *the deluge which resulted in the glacial age, excepting the slight improvement, relatively speaking, by the decrease of the ice area in the arctic regions, as the ice-has slowly subsided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The cause of this recurring action and reaction is clearly understood by those collative students who study the deductions of specialists in astronomy, geology and biology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Astronomers agree that the other planets in our solar system, taken in connection with what geologists find in the earth, illustrate in their various stages of completion the law by which all planets are formed. So we do have a sample by which to make comparisons, and we know the various stages and conditions that this earth has passed through and the cause of its retrogression, the condition when life became possible, and its general history down to the time when human historic record began to give us the details and when a portion of the earth was perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' Excepting the record of the planets we see and the record in earth strata and fossils, the &gt;» Bible is the earliest record we have; and while | some scholars, including most modern theo' logians, do not accept it as authority in physical science, Kant, the greatest authority of modern scholars in philosophy and physical science, and Virchow, the father of modern pathology, and many other first-rank scholars in physical science do accept its authority as final, of course rejecting the known interpolations. Every planet in its molten stage throws off gaseous vapors of various weight and density. These held off by the great heat of the core gain, by friction with its envelop, a revolution of their own. The-lightest gas, hydrogen, rises highest or farthest from the main body, nitrogen and oxygen next; and so on. As the planet cools, its rings fall gradually to it, the oxygen and hydrogen last. Some special features may be . peculiar to each planet, but this feature must prevail in all that belong to the planetary class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The planet at first may be but a body of gas gradually obeying the law of cohesion and friction, gradually solidifying to a liquid molten mass through long periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturn, for instance, is only one-eighth the weight per volume of the earth,-and must be semi-gaseous. Its ring, or combination of rings, is shaped like a wheel about the planet, 172,600 miles in diameter, extending 48,065 miles on each side of it, which is the hub around which the ring revolves; and this ring just outside the planet is 2,000 miles thick. The ring or wheel always revolves in the same plane as does the planet,</span></p><img src="g_E_19210817_files/g_E_19210817-2.png" alt="" style="width:227pt;height:55pt;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and always faces the sun. When seen edgewise it looks like a, and when seen partly sidewise like b. Hence all planets, while in their ring stage, are in thick darkness at their equator, the darkness covering a belt 2,000 miles wide, more or less, according to the size of the planet God, speaking to Job (38:4. 9),accurately describes it: “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? . . . when I made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddling band for it T*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That was thousands of years before any telescopes were made, or any human being could know by observation that planets have rings. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As neither vegetable nor animal life could exist in a wide area of constant, thick darkness, there could be no life on a belt 2,000 miles wide on a planet the size of Saturn, while in its ring stage. But outside of that belt of thick darkness,' after the planet had cooled, normal sunlight and vital physical conditions would he perfect, until the ring began to collapse, and for thousands of years gradually spread out toward the poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the ring spread entirely to the poles, there must have prevailed in the north a physical condition perfect beyond anything man has since known. We know this to be so; for vegetation grew with astonishing vigor. Mammoths larger than elephants are found in* the arctic ice with semi-tropical plants undigested in their stomachs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The physical conditions in the famorth must have been ideal before the ring of vapor spread out over it and shut out the sunlight. For hundreds of years it must have been the only spot on earth which had the clear light of the sun every day in the year and its vitalizing,’oxygenizing rays for development of perfect physical life and the perfect fruits and vegetables to sustain that life. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The human race has never since known any condition approaching that ideal, which is accurately described in Genesis 2:8,9: &quot;And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed; and out of the groupd made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good^ and evil”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Never any thing like this since! Burbank, however, is beginning to produce marvels, but not up to that quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Even under the devitalizing condition that prevails, various herbs, vegetables and fruits have their peculiar distinctive effect upon those who partake of them. The thirty-second solution of the decoction of a certain herb will throw a person into spasms, and the thirty-second solution of the decoction of another herb will recover that person from the spasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We will later further explain why the physical condition on the earth changed, so that never since could such perfection prevail; but we will later clearly demonstrate that we are again nearing physical conditions when that perfection will prevail, not temporarily as then but permanently, in the near future when the Northern Hemisphere will be completed. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Adam disobeyed; and God drove him out of the garden lest he eat of the tree of life and live forever (in disobedience). Neither eternal life nor eternal torment for man is shown here. It was real kindness to drive Adam away from that eternal life-giving food. Though the penalty for disobedience was death, God had a most amazing plan for restitution of Adam and his posterity to life, through the crucifixion of His only begotten, beloved Son Jesus, a ransom of all mankind from the grave—an object lesson to all eternity to all creation of the sublime love of the Father and the Son for the human race, a love higher than any created being could conceive. God’s love and mercy had a double feature. He clearly designed to people the planets with happy, independent, free moral agents, and not automatic machines; and Adam and his posterity were put through a creative process, an experience, that would make them not only lovingly loyal but intelligently obedient, yet free moral agents. &quot;And the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil: and lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This Edenic physical paradise — a perfect physical condition where for hundreds of years in the constant life-giving sunlight eternal lifegiving fruits had come to perfect maturity— soon was over-spread by the thick cloud of vapor from the ring of mixed hydrogen and oxygen shutting out the sun, and eventually the garden was wholly obliterated by vast deposits of snow that settled into glacial ice. Conditions ort the earth now gradually became reversed. The ring in settling down and spreading out had become thinner. The sun and moon could be dimly seen through the veil of vapor over the equatorial regions, and the climatic conditions toward the equator became more favorable for vegetable and animal life than the regions in the north, where for half the year the Indirect rays of the sun and the thick cloud resulted in a twilight condition, and vegetable and animal life began to lose their perfection.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19210817_files/g_E_19210817-3.png" alt="" style="width:79pt;height:53pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The accompanying illustration shows the earth before the ring had spread entirely over it. The conditions into which * Adam and Eve were now driven had never been productive, but entirely dark and barren for long ages. Now, however, by the light like that in a dense forest or on a cloudy day, vegetation began to appear; but men were obliged to work diligently to get a living. This is accurately shown’in Genesis' 3:17-19: &quot;Cursed is the ground for thy sake.... Thoms and thistles shall it bear to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; by the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” That has been the experience of the human race, in general, ever since: in fact, sometimes even worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not misconstrue the statement that the ground was cursed — disfavored — for Adam ► and Eve’s sake. The earth was created especially for the h</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uma</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">n race, and the whole of its creative process was arranged to suit their creative process, their instruction, testing, training and disciplining to be free moral agents, • every man a - miniature king (in. the earth) patterned after the great Ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's, but the earth hath he given to the children of men.”—Psalm 115:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord timed the creation of Adam when the reactionary physical changes on the incompleted planet would devitalize him, causing his death, eventually. In that sense, for his sake, the ground was cursed, unfavorable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This pre-arrangement, specially ordered in Adam’s case, was a part of -the great creative plan relatively just now' beginning to be put into operation, of which the creation of the planets for the special abode of the new, unique species —man — is a contributing feature; and man’s fall, its cause and its remedy, demonstrate the infinite foresight in every minute detail of the divine mind in preparing an effective object-lesson for the instruction in loyal love and obedience, of human beings yet to be created on the billions of planets. We may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sure that by wireless they will converse from planet to planet, rehearse the wondrous story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The tuning of Adam’s creation just when the spreading of the ring of vapor to the far north <sub>K</sub> over the Garden of Eden fulfilled the Lord's mandate driving Adam out of the Garden, fore-j mg him on account of the darkness to migrate ' toward the equator, where it was sufficiently i light, but relatively barren and unproductive of normal life-supporting food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A surprise is in store for mankind — the beginning of the restoration of Edenie conditions and the resurrection of Adam and all of his race. Burbank’s discoveries are only a slight hint of what is coming in life-giving fruits and vegetables. This we will demonstrate conclusively further on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The light shining through the cloud-ring had permitted a growth similar to that in a dense forest, where some light penetrates, but not enough to permit fruits and vegetables to mature. Hence we see by the foregoing narrative in Genesis that Adam and Eve were obliged to scratch very hard for a living—quite a humiliating change for them. They were not in a dense forest, but on semi-barren land. This fully accords with the known physical facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Dating from the time when the ring spread and settled over all the earth, the first stage in the reactionary period lasted 1,656 years; during this stage the vital </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conditions were such</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> that man lived nearly 1,000 years notwithstanding the poor food and lack of clear, vitalizing sunlight. The second stage of the entire reactionary period of 6,000 years began with the complete collapse to earth of the ring in a cloudburst of snow. This, south of the 42nd parallel in the Northern Hemisphere and north of the 42nd parallel in the Southern Hemisphere, melted by the heat of the sun as it fell, or soon after it fell, causing the deluge and the glacial ice-caps in the polar regions. These ice-caps, though ever since slowly subsiding, covered at first approximately 11,000,000 square miles of the earth’s land surface, but now subsided to approximately 7,000,000 square miles, all but about 700,000 of which are on the antarctic continent-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The area of ice in the arctic regions is diminishing rapidly; and when it is all gone the Northern Hemisphere will be completed. Then, for the</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">first time in 6,000 years, reaction will cease, and advance will again begin, a gradual but permanent return to the physical conditions in the Garden of Eden all over the earth instead of in one spot</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The second and final stage of the 4,344 years of the 6,000 year period of reaction was accompanied with far greater destruction than the first stage, notwithstanding that the fall of the ring had permitted the clear light of the sun to vitalize all life on the whole earth more than </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">eVer</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> before, except on a narrow belt in the norths</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The vast ice-fields immediately placed every thing on earth in cold storage. AH of New England and to the north pole and most of Europe to the north pole were covered with ice hundreds ” of feet thick. All vegetable and animal life near the ice was devitalized almost to the point of extinction, retaining only a bare existence, practically a hibernating state of all vegetable and animal life, stupified and benumbed by a condition grossly abnormal on the planet. Normal life has been impossible; and what we have known as life has been but a faint conception, a nightmare, in comparison with normal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On the North American continent, the belt of greatest vitality was in Guatamala, 1,500 miles south of this; but the changes were so sudden and extreme that everything was stunted. When the north wind blew from the vast expanse of ice in the north, everything was chilled through, if not frosted, as far south as Central America; and when the south wind blew from the equator, relatively near, everything wilted with heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The changes must have been so sudden and extreme that only the strongest co’ild endure. This accounts for the cave dwellers in Europe. Caves were the ideal residences then; for in them the extremes of sudden change were-rrindi-fied. Somewhat similar meteorological condi* . tions still prevail, but we have become inured to them, and they grow less extreme as the area of ice diminishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine-tenths of the area of the ice in the arctio region has subsided; and when nine-tenths of the ice in the refrigerator is gone, the remainder goes quickly. It is not normal for ice to form or to remain on the planet, except on the loftiest mountains. This is .demonstrated by the fact that it is steadily subsiding as normal conditions slowly assert themselves.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There is scarcely any human record of the * period ju^t subsequent to maximum glaciation —only a brief reference in the Bible, and a few rode sketches in the caves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Except near the equator human beings were m&gt; benumbed that all they eould think of, or do, was to get barely food enough to keep life within them. They degenerated like the wild animals. Vegetables and fruits of the temperate zone must have become nearly extinct. The caves indicate the desperate struggle for a bare existence. There the debris of animals, bones and &quot;&nbsp;rubbish of fossils collected in successive layers without being cleared out. Evidently at that time mankind lived in part on the frozen carcasses of the animals that were ejected from the terminal moraines of the glaciers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Under the extremely devitalizing change brought about by the Deluge and its sequence, the glacial age, in the close of which we are now living, human life was shortened from nearly one thousand years to sixty or seventy at the most. But in addition to the vast devitalizing ice-fields, another devitalizing agent began to operate just after the Deluge, and in the regions free from ice brought upon mankind all kinds of germ diseases, which did not prevail in the antediluvian age. Colds, catarrh, tuberculosis, fevers, diphtheria, smallpox, cancer and scores of other germ diseases appeared, attacking man and the vegetables and fruits upon which he subsisted. All these diseases are the agents of death, fermentation and putrefaction that have possibly been spread from decaying vegetable and animal matter, and have fouled the atmosphere with a new devitalizing agent since the Deluge— nitrogen gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The unburied bodies of trillions of land fowl, animals and men that perished at that time, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">think, without a doubt filled the atmosphere with a greater proportion of this gas, a new element originating from decaying animal matter since the earth became filled with animals and men that have expired. This gas apparently first began to accumulate to any injurious degree just after the Deluge. Its enormous increase in volume ever since, through the decay of dead animals and men, has loaded the atmosphere with a non-life-supporting, if not a positively disease-carrying medium, the result of a vicious round of birth and death, ever spreading death to food-bearing vegetation for man and animals and to animals and men, reducing by nearly eight-tenths the relative volume of oxygen, the agent in the air which, breathed into the lungs, purifies the blood. This superabundance of nitrogen thus reduces the power of men and animals to throw off disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Whether this gas is the direct medium of conveyance of disease germs is not fuDy determined. See footnote.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Even when animal matter is buried in the ground, however deep, most of it turns to nitrogen gas and escapes through the earth into the atmosphere. Hence this new cumulative element, since death of animals and men began, has come to be the great factor of death, and its removal is a vital necessity to the preservation of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The recent influenza plague all over the world must have had a. cause that was conveyed in the atmosphere; and it is logical to conclude that itwas the result of the great number of animals and men left dead and unburied during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In old thickly settled countries most of the physical, life-giving element in the soil has, by constant cropping, been drawn from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Countless trillions of insects, birds, animals and mankind, as before stated, have matured from earth’s products and have died, decayed and mostly evaporated into nitrogen gas, a vast volume of which has accumulated in the atmosphere as the ages have passed. It is tire very essence, the extract, of the vital substance or quality of animal matter extracted from the earth and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stored</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the air. As above stated, we all know that these vital elements have in some places been drained so completely from the soil that it is worn out and will not produce food for man or beast. Hence another factor tends to shorten human life—diminishing nutriment in food products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If this process of birth and growth and death and decay—the constant extracting of the vital element from tlie earth, and through vegetable and fruit food production the transferring of it</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">•Some kinds of bacteria thrive In nitrogen gas. and other kinds thrive tn oxygen gas. We might infer from this that as oxygen purifies the blood, bacteria in oxygen destroy bacteria in nitrogen, i consulted the Dean of the Harvard Medical School on this subject. who said that It wan net yet determined whether nitrogen </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gas</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the medium of the conveyance of disease genua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to insects, birds, animals, and mankind, and at their death the transferring of it to the atmosphere, in the shape of nitrogen gas—continued, it would only be a question of time, with increase of population, until all life-giving quality for food for birds, animals, and men would be extracted from the earth, and man would become extinct, through lack of nourishing, lifegiving food and because of an ever decreasing percentage of oxygen taken into his lungs, to purify his blood. Any one must see that this would be inevitable; for the factors of extinction would work from both the air and the soiL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are now at a culminating point similar to the Deluge. Under the confusion caused by the World War and the breakup of orderly economic conditions, the /ack of industrial occupation and remuneration for the masses, great social and political excitement will for some time still further increase the death rate, a vicious round of birth, death and decay. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The time has come when some fundamental change and remedy is imperative, if the human race is to survive. I will later show the remedy. Still another factor of demoralization, distress and death, the most perplexing and aggravating of all, has Tor 6,000 years contributed to make man's life a living death—Satan and his angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are all more or less familiar with their history; but because they cannot be seen with the physical eye most people doubt their existence. But judged by the devilish things some, people do, it is self-evident that an unseen influence is putting them up to do things that an average horse, dog, or pig, or even a monkey, would be ashamed to do. Instead of evoluting they have devoluted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Evil spirits work by constant suggestion on the human mind, and a constant dropping of water will wear away even a stone. ''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said that Satan was the prince (ruler) of this world, this age — this social, political, economic and religious world. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The thought no doubt enters your mind, &quot;If all this is true why did God create man before the earth was completed and oblige him to undergo such terrible hardships and live an unnatural, abnormal life, tempted and fooled by an unseen devil! Surely that does not look like wisdom, love, justice or mercy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If you understood God's plan you would see</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the marvelous wisdom and love of all this and. its justice and mercy also. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Divine Mind knows perfectly the law of cause and effect; for He created all things to operate by that law. He saw the whole process from beginning to end before He created the world. “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) As » before stated, and it is well worth repeating, God wanted free nporal agents, beings, angels * and men, that would not be mere automatie machines, but beings that would of their own ... volition do the right thing. Only training and experience would create such characters. Evidently there was no precedent that could bo used as an object lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God foresaw that Lucifer—&quot;Morning Star”— the great angel who had been put in charge over man, would become ambitious, conceited, and would plan to have a kingdom all his own, making Adam and Eve and their descendents his servants. They had no experience. Lucifer, now named Satan, was more subtle and powerful than they; moreover, he was invisible to them, and could, and can still, control men un- 1 less they are the on watch and resist him. But as most people do not believe that there is any such being they cannot be on the watch for him, and so are easily misled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God, knowing what Satan and Adam and Eve would do, created Adam and Eve in that relatively short period of time, between the stages of the earth's development when the conditions on a small part of it were normal— complete—perfect; otherwise Adam could not have known what he lost by disobedience; hie experience would not have been perfect. As soon as Adam disobeyed, the Creator drove him out of the completed spot, where the fruit of the orchards was perfect, and would sustain life as long as he ate of it; and the next stage in the creation of the earth followed, with its devitalizing reaction, which carried out the sentence of death on Adam and Eve and their posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But God's plan then was, and is now, to restore Adam and all of his posterity to life, giving them their first chance, after having had experience and a fair trial under perfect conditions with no invisible devil to tempt them. Then if they disobey, having had experience and an object lesson, they will be annihilated in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">second death. The proof of thia is given later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jeans said that the hour is coming when all t</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">h**</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> axe in the graves shall come forth. (John 5:28) The atmosphere is filled with nitrogen, from which their bodies can be instantly created, as this gas is the essence of animal matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Here on this planet, we may assume, is the _ first peopling of a planet, and all of this story of man's fall and recovery. The dreadful con-' sequences of disobedience will be an object lesson to all eternity, a lesson so vivid and im, , pressive to the people hereafter to be created, and to angels also, that no more will there be disobedience. Furthermore, the amazing love shown by the Father and the Son in all this transaction will prevent any desire to disobey or any ambition io rule except by divine direction. We do not know, but reason would con-elude that no other planet will be peopled until 'it is fully completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The planet Mars is in its glacial age, as its polar ice-caps are plainly visible; and we may assume that it will be the next planet to be peopled, when its ice-caps are all melted. There is scarcely any question but that, when it is peo-\ pled, conversation between Mars and this earth will, by wireless, readily take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We may assume that every solar system has, or will have, as many planets as our solar system; and as three billion suns have been counted, there will be twenty or more billion planets to be peopled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Is there any doubt whatever that, under the terrible physical conditions which have prevailed and in which man as well as all animal and vegetable life has existed in a benumbed state — barely clinging to life for a few years — this life is grossly abnormal, a mere fraction of what it will be in length, vigor and perfection, when all these devitalizing conditions have passed away and for the first time the entire earth will be complete and perfect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">During this long period of 6,000‘years the creative process on earth has rendered con-ditiona terrible by comparison and literally almost beyond man's strength to endure. This surely was bad enough; but Satan has made it still more of a hell, a living death to the mass of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As we look back, the picture is very dark, and bids fair to be darker still; and if we did not know that just ahead of us the dark night of sin, sorrow, death and destruction is to give place to the glorious light of a new day, we might Well tremble with fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">No doubt the next few years, the climax of anarchy, the disintegrating of the present social, -political, economic, and religious world we have known, will be the greatest time of trouble ever known. Jesus, forecasting it, said (Matthew 24:22): &quot;Except those days should he shortened there should no flesh he saved<sup>3</sup>'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In a letter to me from the editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literary Digest,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> which I have quoted in another article, but which is so pertinent that it will bear repeating in this connection, he said: “Civilization is in the awful throes of a rebirth, and this stupendous, upheaval will in all probabilitychange your life and the life of every living man and woman about you”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As before stated, Jesus (referring to the present time) said that Satan was the prince (the ruler) of this world. He said (John 12:&quot; 31): “Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince [Satan] of this world be cast out”; and the present condition of wars, contention, destruction, crime and misery is the ch-max of the trouble engendered in casting him ouL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan's rule at best has been devilish. Who has been satisfied with it ? Possibly a few of the favored ones. Who wants to perpetuate that rule? No doubt in the next few years the disturbance and confusion incident to the work of casting him out will be awfully distressing. But cheer up! It is always darkest just before day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the process of casting him out? He is like his dupes—give him plenty of rope and he will hang himself. He has made an awful mess of things, and all that is needed is to turn on the light and let men see the mess. Jesus . explained the process (Matthew 25:25): &quot;If Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?” - <sub>w </sub>’The destructive quality of hate, the logical sequence of selfishness, the predominating fear ture of Satan's character, as shown by his </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">am</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">bition to have a kingdom all his own, separate from God's kingdom, has hypnotized all his dupes. This selfish desire, this lust for world empire, culminated in the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kaiser and the English imperialists fought for world dominion and dragged all the world into the fight. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> the nations had their</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">own little selfish plans. Satan's kingdom is tearing itself down. Cohesion is gone, incipient anarchy prevails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A great light, as at the first advent of our Lord, is shining -in the darkness. Like lightning it is flashing; and still more like the early light of a new day it steadily dawns. Only a few, however, recognize its source. This light is showing up Satan’s lies, his character, and the character of his dupes. They are spiritually blind; they cannot see this light. &quot;And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.”—John 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan and his dupes do not realize that this light is showing them up in their true colors. &quot;And then shall that wicked [one] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”—2 Thessalonians 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Men have not realized the astounding import of the light which during the past forty-five years has shone into the minds of men like Russell, Edison, Marconi and thousands of others in religious truth, electrical science, physical science, sociology, economics, chemistry, world politics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan and his dupes have been taken by surprise. Satan has chuckled, saying to himself, “I can use these miracles to strengthen my kingdom”. The selfish profiteer chuckles: &quot;I can make millions, aye billions, out of these miracles”. But the light has kept on shining, flooding all the dark places in men’s minds. Gradually the'fog of ignorance and superstition is lifting. Men have been inspired to read, study and think for themselves as never before. Men cannot so readily be held in slavery. The benumbing effect of the ice age is yielding—the physical and the spiritual go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sanitary conditions are improving, medical and surgical skill also. Satan is gradually coming to the conclusion that something unusual 4s threatening his kingdom—he has been taken by surprise. Thief-like, the light has come into his house, his kingdom. He hates the light; he is the great imperialist, he wants his dupes, except a few whom he has made his cabinet officials, to be kept in ignorance, especially the masses— his slaves—but the light keeps on flooding the dark places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan tries to control all of the newspapers and fill them with lies; but the people see the trick, start new papers and write new books. He corners the print paper, and. so the light goes on, and the fight also. He might as well try to keep back the ocean tide with a broom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Imperial Satan, the imp, riding on the backs of the people and for 6,000 years, vampire-like, sucking the life of mankind: the ring about the earth, that devitalized mankind for 1,656 years and finally drowned all but Noah and his family; the ice-caps, which nearly finished man again, putting him into cold storage—all are -either gone or at the point of going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But what about the vast deposit of nitrogen gas in the atmosphere, that threatens to annihilate the human race, after having survived all these cataclysms! The great light now shining in men’s mind also is equal to this new menace. Divine economy is always equal to the necessity; and this menace, this devitalizing' agent, nitrogen in the air, is the richest fertilizer known and is being transformed from • menace into the greatest temporal blessing, reinvigorating, vitalizing and restoring man to the perfect physical condition that existed in the garden of .Eden—a completed planet, the first one, as far as we know, to be finished and peopled in all the universe; in reality the real beginning of creation now. This is no dream of fancy—no figure of speech. It is a literal, selfevident fact, an amazing reality. Through the extraction of this nitrogen from the atmosphere and its distribution in the soil, every acre of land, even the sandy desert of Sahara, irrigated, can be made to blossom as the rose literally, producing fruits and food more vitalizing and life-sustaining for vegetation and for man than was ever dreamed of even by Burbank, the wizard in agriculture, as Edison is the wizard in electrical science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Edison says that we are only on the threshold of the development of electrical science. This new light that is coming into men’s minds is sure to destroy completely all selfish monopolies, including that of verbal communication. The United States Government is already preparing a plan for wireless communication on the postal system plan, that will for a few cento . be accessible to all. This new light that is shining into men’s minds has shown them, and is continuing to show them, new laws that govern matter, so that new inventions are multiplying that rival the greatest miracles ever performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Nothing seems impossible any longer. The latest invention reported is the helicopter, an airplane that rises or descends vertically, can meant to a great height in a few seconds, is not affected by wind or weather, and is capable of standing still in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For instance, as reported, it will be possible at Boston to go above the friction of the envelop of the earth as it rolls around at the rate of 1,000 miles an hour, remain stationary and in twelve hours come down in China, take supper, and, after a good night's sleep above the clouds, take breakfast the next morning in Boston. This seems impossible, all this long-distance travel with very little expenditure of motive power; bat stranger things are being done. Bailroads, trolleys, and autos will be old* junk. Also the evil system, “Satan’s kingdom”, misnamed “Christendom”, “Christian Civilization” (so-called) will be “old junk”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Through this same great light comes another discovery of fabulous qualities of energy—radium has been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who have experimented with it claim that it prolongs the life of the fruit-fly, which is very brief, to 700 times its normal length. If it has the same effect, on mankind, even under present conditions, it would prolong the lives of some persons 49,000 years and some even 70,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To return to the consideration of nitrogen gas, its pressure in the atmosphere is plus 11$ pounds to the square inch, its volume has increased to 7.9 percent of the atmosphere and to 77 percent of its weight; it is incapable of supporting life, hence it is dead air in the lungs. Over every square acre of land and water there are 33,880 gross tons of this gas. It is only slightly soluble in water, hence heavy rains do not clear it from the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As .-&lt;• stated, from a devitalizing element in the air that threatens the destruction of the human race, nitrogen is being transformed into the most invigorating, life-sustaining element through stimulation of vegetable growth, that man has ever found, restoring him to the physical perfection that was available in the garden of Eden through the medium of perfect fruits and grains, matured, of eternal life-giving quality. How wonderful is divine economy! One hundred thousand tons of this nitrogen is available for every acre of land; and it being the very essence, the extract of animal matter, the fifty billions of human, beings that have died could be created out of it, besides the soil being reinvigorated for their support</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Heretofore, the expense of extracting nitrogen from the air for commercial fertilizer has been prohibitive. But a new invention has overcome the difficulty, and a plant in Germany is successfully operating with a force of 8,000 men. A plant is now operating in Sweden, and the United States Government is building one costing millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not reasonable to expect that eternal life-giving fruit will mature and eternal-life physical conditions will prevail immediately. All things follow natural law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In creative perfection we see that divine economy admits no mushroom growth. All lasting quality is of slow development The century plant blooms only once in a long period of time. Slowly, slowly, the creative processes unfold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As the earth and all creation respond to the divine will and the divine purpose, w*e enter the new epoch in the divine plan with slow and steady motion, responding to the new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">When restitution to Edenic conditions commences, or we might say that when earth becomes one great Edenic paradise, as was first contemplated, human life, we must conclude, will be prolonged through the natural-agencies before mentioned. This is self-evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It requires a thousand years for the mighty Sequoia tree to mature, and we may be sure that the tree of life (the perfect work of the Christ) that bears eternal life-giving fruit will require that length of time to mature and bear fruit. (Possibly by the end of the Millenium a food will have been discovered which will perfectly meet the needs of the human body, and so, with God’s blessing, sustain life forever.)-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">While the Northern Hemisphere of the earth is nearing the completion that is to follow the entire disappearance of the ice from the arctic regions, six or more million square miles of ice still remain on the antarctic continent; and while its effect will be negligible in the Northern Hemisphere on account of its being isolated by such a wide expanse of water and the V.anu temperature of the equatorial waters, yet it must haw some etb'ct on vital conditions here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The extremely low temperature there is moderating, but we may expect that, the ice may</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">still persist for perhaps a thousand years more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Human life lasted in the antediluvian age for nearly 1.000 years; and in the completion of earth to the Edenic conditions first contem-, plated we can readily see that as we gradually <sup>z</sup> near perfection of physical conditions, all other . conditions of life will correspond and, as Benjamin Franklin predicted, man's life will extend a thousand years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Under the conditions of life in the past, the vicious and the incorrigible did not live out half of their allotted time. This law of cause and effect will of course.continue to operate, if no other law cuts off tlibir life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But there is to be no more cloud-ring or deluge or ice. Steady advance toward perfection is now the order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The vicious and the incorrigible will die out . quickly. Jesus said of the time now nearly due -that there would be no more marriages, no more bearing of children. He said that people would be as rhe angels in that respect, but He did not say that men and women would be spirit beings like the angels—Matthew 22: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a logical conclusion that after 1,000 years have expired, under perfect normal physical conditions, the vicious, the wicked and the incorrigible will all then be extinct.and out of the way. The righteous will then live forever. Men and- women, and all physical conditions, will be perfect—normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the record we have of the length of human life before the Deluge, even under the imperfect physical conditions, where the sunlight did not have its full invigorating effect, men lived almost 1,000 years. But now under the more perfect physical conditions which will ensue after the ice is all gone from the arctic region and we may reasonably expect it within fifty years if not before; after the volume of nitrogen in the air be diminished, giving a greater percentage of oxygen in the lungs to purify the blood, and the nitrogen restored to the soil to stimulate its virgin quality of animal life-giving food, great increase of medical knowledge and skill, the application of radium and other life-prolonging agencies, mankind with increasing purity of thought, word and action will live forever — the normal life of man. So we may logically say that millions now living will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“And I saw a new heaven [a new religious condition] and a new earth [a new social, political and economic condition]; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them; and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God.

<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Direct Marketing and Trading </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By John Mulholland (Toledo)</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E SHALL know tht truth and the truth shall make you free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How can this nation remain free, if the people allow “The Food Combine” to monopolize the means of marketing the people's food supply and to collect tribute from rich and poor alike f</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A system of direct marketing and trading between producers and consumers everywhere should be established without delay, to take the place of the present worn-out, privately-owned and manipulated markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Such q system is provided in the Producers and Consumers' Direct Mark.lin^ and Trading</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">International Federation, of which the writer is president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The All-American Farmer-Labor Congress, at its national convention in Cleveland, on Lin-coin’s birthday, February 12,1921, unanimously indorsed this plan. This carries with it the active cooperation of the great American labor and farmer movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The word cooperation has in the past been interp’reted too narrowly by some. It does not always mean cooperative stores, though it includes them. It means the working together of all groups opposed to private monopoly of the means of marketing the people's necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAFFIC IN FOOD SHOULD BB UNHAMPERED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It must be plain that God never designed that • few selfish individuals should, through the use of money and manipulation, get control of the food supply of the innumerable human beings of the race which He created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Products of farm, garden and orchard are necessary to sustain human life on the earth. Without them the human race would perish from the earth. Food is just as necessary in one season as another. This being so, food is worth just as much in June as in January. A standard price should be fixed to be enforced, subject to official changes, the year round. This would abolish gambling and profiteering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We believe that the Almighty j the father and Creator of mankind, never meant that a few men through the organization of a food combine, should be able to starve humanity at will. For a time God has permitted many such things for a purpose—to separate the gold from the dross, to refine and purify some of the sons of men. In His own due time He will abolish all such injustices, and establish “thy kingdom come” right here on earth. That time seems to be at the doors—right now, when He will set up His kingdom. The present time of unrest and trouble is just the darkness before the dawn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We believe that these wars and rumors of wars, and of earthquakes and f</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ne, are indications of the birth and beginning of a new world—the Golden Age. Bead your Bible; it tells all about that new era!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There are millions of people — the forlorn, and forsaken, widows and orphans—that go to bed hungry every night; and this occurs in every nation, including this boasted “Christian&quot; nation. We should find ont what is the matter with the world, and with this cmintrv. t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MARKETING SYSTEM WOULD HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The American people can initiate any legislation they see fit, and can in the different states pass the necessary marketing laws to establish direct marketing and trading between producers and consumers in all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">No matter what their beliefs or their polities, the people agree that the cost of living is too high, and that they should get together in a nonpartisan way and free themselves from this great injustice. It is high time that the people took counsel together as a matter of self-protection, to safeguard themselves against further manipulation and profiteering in food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A new marketing system, owned and operated _ by the people themselves, in each municipality, to supplant the present privately-owned system, . cannot be worked out on a postal card. It needs . time and space properly to outline this people’s ^movement before the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The high cost of living can be reduced to what it ought to be under the existing laws of the Republic. It can be done by the following plan, which will establish a new, direct marketing and trading system, based on justice to all and for all?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The plan contemplates public ownership of the means of transportation, and public ownership of markets and cold storage houses, thus providing for direct marketing, trading, and cooperative buying and selling, all safeguarded • by a public banking system. This will solve the living-cost problem, and protect the people from further exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The present system of marketing the people's food supply all over the land has led to speculation, gambling, manipulation and profiteering. , It has led to the use of short weights and measures, packages, crates and baskets. It buys from the farmer by weight, but resells to the consumer by packages and baskets, which often cost a substantial fraction of the selling price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. THE PLAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There should be, for public protection against ’ profiteers, direct marketing and cooperative buying and selling between the producers and the consumers. There should be a new market- . ing system based on the plan of public ownership of markets and cold storage houses, in each and every municipality. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The markets should be joint, general retail markets, connected with the cold-storage plants, ice plants, creameries and bakeries. All should be under one roof. These combination markets should be operated at cost, and not for profit, in behalf of all the people, producers and consumers alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The markets should be erected in community and social centers for the benefit of the localities in which they are established. They should contain large and small public forum halls, where</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">anything in any way affecting the welfare of the people may be freely discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The joint market and storage plants may be used as a base of supplies and a center of operation for all the existing cooperative societies, wholesale and retail, country or city. The markets can give the societies all kinds of marketing facilities, for receiving supplies and distributing them to their members. They will furnish the best kind of icingiaud refrigeration privi-. leges at cost. Such markets would not in any way interfere with the present plans of operation or financing of any existing or future cooperative socie ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The markets will act as clearing places for the municipality in matters of public welfare. Everything used in common should be paid for in common by all the people. These markets should be erected and maintained at public ex’ pense, the same as a police force, fire department, street lighting, sewers, sidewalks, roads and bridges. These are maintained at public expense, and not one of them is nearly so important as the control of the food supply has become in every city and town of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Each market should be built near and connected with steam, electric and truck lines of transportation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">From these great public plants traveling stores for the public can be sent out. These will be on enclosed motor trucks, big enough to carry groceries, meats and supplies direct to the homes. They can be sent along certain streets each day. The people can come out to buy and as they leave these “Self-Serve Cooperative Stpres,” can pay the driver for what they take. Deliveries would be made on a self-serve, cash-and-carry, one-man-store plan, with cost of all expensive overhead charges cut out—reducing the high cost of living to the bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">These markets can be maintained from the rents of the stalls and stands, and the space set aside for the cooperative societies, without a cent of cost to the municipalities. The municipalities only lend' their credit for the issuing of the bonds to raise the funds for the first cost of building the plant. The Revenue from the market will pay off the bonds when due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPOSED LAWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The following two paragraphs are taken from the proposed market laws of Toledo, Ohio. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">show that the people have it in their own hands to change and abolish the present worn-out marketing system, whenever they get together to do it: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The people, in whom all power abides when initial* ing legislation, or legislating for themselves, are preme over all other governmental powers. The President of the United States, the Congress and the Courts must all bow to the will of the people when expressed in a law initiated and created by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>&lt;r</sup>Be it enacted by the people of Toledo, Ohio: • • • &quot;Initiating direct legislation by the electors of the municipality, amending the charter of the city of Toledo, Ohio, creating a department of municipal markets and cold-storage houses, to be owned, maintained and operated cost by the city as public markets of the City of Toledo, providing for the nomination-and ejection of a market ^manager, fixing compensation for his services and how the revenues ore to be obtained and disbursed, and the doing of all things needful for the establishment and maintenance by the City of Four (1) Municipal Joint Retail Markets, to be located in the east end, west end, north, and south ends of Toledo; respectively, and authorizing and directing the financedirector of the City of Toledo to issue one million ($1,000,000) dollars in twenty-year municipal bond% to be used for the establishment of such municipal markets and directing the mayor and the finance director to issue and properly sign and sell such market bonds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">•There are twenty-one states, Ohio included, which have the initiative and referendum laws at the present time, so the people in these states can initiate any kind of market law they may desire. All that is necessary is for the people to organize and circulate the petitions putting the new market law on the ballot by petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The plan is to have each municipality acting for itself, by petition legislation take a vote of the people on the establishment of the joint markets and cold storage houses, and a market manager to be elected by the people, with rules and regulations for the government of these markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The cost of the markets would be about $200,000 each, for which municipal bonds would be voted at such election. The bonds would be made payable in twenty years, in twenty annual payments, or $10,000 a year with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To illustrate, in a city of 200,000 people, it would cost the people one dollar apiece, and they would hav6 twenty years to pay the dollar. That dollar payment would be divided into twenty annual payments of only five cents per year per person. For only five cents a year paid into the public-market sinking-fund the people of the city could have one of these markets. There could be four markets, one in each section of the city, for twenty cents per year per person—all operated, at cost and not for profit, in behalf of all the people of the city, and saving hundreds of dollars for each family. .What if they cost $400,000 each! That would be only ten cents a year per person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Under this system of self-taxation, there would be no rents charged for stalls, stands, or cooperative stores. Under our other plan just enough rent would be charged to pay into the joint-market sinking-fund enough money to retire the bonds when due and pay the interest on them. The people would choose the plan to work under. * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF TRANSPORTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The plan of public ownership of the means of transportation, as advocated by the Railroad Brotherhoods, will reduce the cost of the necessities of life and their transporting and marketing. Public ownership of railroads will give free intercourse among the states, cities, towns and villages, and will remove manipulation and gambling in railroad securities. Railroads operated and owned by the people, would be operated at cost and not for profit, in behalf of the nation, and would bring a blessing to the entire . country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Then when a producer hauls his products to the nearest railway point, he will place them in the charge of the station agent, who will be a public servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The producer will ship his produce directly to the public joint-markets and cold storage warehouses, consigned to the market-master at Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Toledo, or elsewhere. The farmer when shipping to these publicly owned markets will know that the city is back of the markets and that he will be paid for his products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Everything sold in these markets, from eggs to oranges, will be sold by weight. The cows producing the milk will be properly inspected by the veterinary surgeons of the respective municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The products will be hauled to market by railroad men who also will be public servants. From the time the products leave the farm until they are sold over the counter at the markets, they will never leave the custody of servants of the public. It will be impossible for any gambling, manipulation, or profiteering in the people’s food supply to exist. The cost of Hving can be reduced about fifty percent; for statistic* ’ show that about half the cost of living goes to unnecessary middlemen fo^ handling or for keeping books on the people’s food supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The prices paid by these publicly owned markets for products should be calculated on some equitable basis, such as the value of farm lands in the several states or districts, cost of seeds, planting, labor and overhead expense to the producer—things which should always be considered in fixing prices. Without food the human race will die; as life itself depends on products of the farm, the latter are worth to human beings the same every day in the year. In fairness to producer and consumer, prices should be fixed by public commissions, elected by the states when other state officials are elected, and supervised by a Federal Food Price Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC BANKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In each market may be established a branch of the Public Bank. When the products.are sold the market master, elected by the people of the community, will deposit the money to the credit of the producer who has shipped in his products. This keeps the people’s money out of the hands of men who would corner it. Public bulletins would reach the producers frequently, telling where produce is needed, and what markets are fully supplied. In these free and unmanipulated markets the producer and the consumer can meet face to face, and freely trade with one another without the interference of middlemen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SOME PLAN IS NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Private ownership of the means of marketing the people’s food supply has broken down, as everyone knows. It has led to monopoly and profiteering. To protect the people’s interests public ownership must take its place without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The plan here advocated is legal, under the present laws of the republic. Now the people must be brought up to date, so that they wfll think and live in terms of the twentieth century. -Young men are needed. The old men, who through past-age methods got the people into the World War—and if the people don’t look out</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">this class will get them into more wars—have to be retired to private life, or somehow put into the rear for the good of the country, so that the people can get from where they are to where they ought to be as a nation whose face is ' turned toward “the dawn of the new day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This is and should be a people's nonpartisan movement. No one of the common people especially will want to be left out; each will want to have his place and part. AU interests should be represented. All groups of the people everywhere in the United State should cooperate to the end that the people of the nation may at the earliest date possible, through the means of public ownership, direct marketing, trading, cooperative buying and selling, take over the means of distributing the people’s necessities of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HEAL MEN WANTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are reminded of Holland’s great poem: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“God give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great heart?, true faith and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does-not kill, Men whom the spoils of office do not buy, Meo who possess opinions and a will, Men who have honor, men who will not lie, Men who can stand before a demagogue</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking, Tall men, sun-crowned men, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions and their little deeds, Mingle in selfish strife, lo, Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven” — the prayer wo learned at mother’s knee — is the call of the hour. Service for others has been demonstrated to bring the greatest happiness in the world. “One touch of humanity's call makes all the world kin.” A tear or a sob from a woman or a little child in distress, gives a tug at the heart-strings of the world; and all weep in a common sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are dealing with a new world—a shaken, impoverished, exhausted, torn, embittered, suffering, weeping, sorrowing world, smiHen down by selfishness, greed and injustice. To help bind up the<sup>-</sup> world’s wounds, to cure this sickness, to have a part in placing hope for despair in human hearts, to help lift some of the burdens off the backs of the poor, the forlorn and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">forsaken, the widow and the orphan, to help wipe away the tears, so that happiness may have some place in their lives, to see this happiness reflected in their faces, ought to be reward enough for any man in this life. To help bring this about is the aim of tliis movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Through this plan the people can get together and by so doing save themselves much serious trouble in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should right be ever on the scaffold, while wrong is on the throne t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Choose ye this day whom ye will serve*— God or Mammon I He who is not for the peopi', is against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There is evidence on every hand that the worship of “the money god” is being set up ip the United States of America. The newspapers are full of it</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylon and Rome fell and went down to the dust when they worshiped false gods. The American people should see that they do not fall the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">United States Controller of the Currency, Williams, announced that “the steel trust has made such enormous profits in the past few years that it could have paid its working men and officials double the wages it paid them, and then made over one hundred million doi-lars”, while our country was in the war, as was claimed, for humanity’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The press announced in February the organization of a new iron and steel corporation to take in all manufacturers of iron and steel everywhere in the world. When one thinks what the steel trust has done to America, what does this new giant mean to us? Just this—the worship of “the money god” is being set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Beef Trust and Food Combine”, through interlocking directorates and other schemes, control some seven hundred concerns—banks, -cold storage houses, warehouses, packing plants, stockyards, railroads, terminal railroads and facilities, and many other things too numerous to mention—including hundreds of delicatessen stores in the large cities secretly financed by the food trust to control distribution of food down to the ultimate consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">When meat got so high priced that common people could not afford to buy it, and the great war might have been lost because of this, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Government ordered the Federal Trade Commission to investigate thia trust The Commission worked over a year on it, and did not get half through with the investigation; but they, found one of the greatest trusts on earth. &quot;The Commissioners prepared a chart, showing and giving the names of the banks and other concerns in the combine.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On February 28, 1921, the newspapers an-‘ nounced, &quot;High Court knocks out act to punish profiteers — Lever Control Law squashed”. Jhink of it! This law was used in 1919 to deprive the miners of our country of rights guaranteed them under the Constitution of the United States. Under this law the Government apent hundreds of millions of dollars of the people’s tax money investigating and securing, evidence against the profiteers, the food combine and the coal trust. An army of men was engaged in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On February 26, 1921, the press had<sup>-</sup> announced that 226 coal operators and workers had been indicted by the Government under the Anti-Trust Law. Only forty-eight hours after the announcement of the indictments the High <sup>v</sup> Court, with a wave of its hand, abolished the Lever Law, and released the indicted millionaires from their peril. It was claimed at the time the law was passed that it was to protect the people’s interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The taking over of the railroads during the .war and leaving the management of them in the hands ofthe very men who in the past had trifled, gambled, and speculated in them, was wrong, especially after hundreds of millions of dollars of the public money had been put into them for improvements. The crowning crime was the turning of the roads back to the same manipulators under a Government guarantee of six percent on all real and watered stock. This is trifling with the American people's patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SEW STANDARDS NEEDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What this nation needs is a new standard of life, socially, economically, financially, politically, morally and rcdigiously. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ari can people must put God into their program, their business life, their everyday life and their home life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If the people are to get proper protection, they must protect themselves through some such</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">plan as that outlined here. This will break the stranglehold of the trusts. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The dawn of a new day is at hand. The man with the hoe has broken the silence, of the cen- . turies. He is demanding his proper share of the wealth he produces. This means the ushering in of a new social order—a new standard of life. It can all come under the present laws and by the use of existing and lawful means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">America and her people cannot continue to • live under the present deplorable conditions and retain their self-respect. When self-respect is gone, the descent of a nation, is rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Governments everywhere in the world reflect' the people they represent. The United States Government reflects its people. If it should go on the rocks, the catastrophe would be the people’s own fault. The people can have a better government when they themselves get better and become more worthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The people must not fool themselves about this. If there were to be no change from the present deplorable conditions, this life would not be worth living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Get right with God. His is the only power • that can save, reconstruct and rebuild this wronged, bleeding, weeping, wounded, dying world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the p ople get together under God before it is too- late to save themselves and their country, that this civilization may not pass from the w<sup>T</sup>orld, as have other civilizations that have persisted in disobeying God’s laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In God we trust.” No one else is worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The World War was the climax, and marked the collapse of man-made things and institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The establishment of a new marketing system is the people's business. The common people must themselves see to the distribution of their food. It is because they have not done so in the past that they now have the high cost of existence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Texas Cotton Contracts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> HAVE just read, with much interest, your probe at the farm problem, and am truly glad that the One- Periodical which must De regarded by all as being entirely independent in all that it says, has begun to give publicity to the great injustice under which producers of farm products are being forced to sell their products at such heavy </span><span class="font7">losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">however, one item in your article referring to the Farm Bureau, which I desire to'notice briefly; to-wit, your mention of thia organization with apparent approval. My purpose is to call your attention to certain details of this organization in regard to their proposed plan of selling cotton; as I am of the opinion that you probably have not had occasion to investigate their marketing contract for cotton, a copy of it is herewith enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I need not remind you of the great amount of propaganda now given publicity by the subsidized press, tending to cover up the real issues involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems to have been the purpose, when the Fann Bureau was organized in certain states in the Middle West, to serve the fanners faithfully and efficiently, especially along legislative and economic lines. Recently, however, this or-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By I. B. Alford </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ganization has made its advent into the State of Texas, where cotton is the great money-crop of our farmers. On investigation of the contract by means of which this association proposes to market cotton, it appears manifestly certain that little or no relief to farmers may be expected from it, while the possibilities for harm are without limit or restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I desire to call your attention to the influences behind this movement in Texas. The first and most potent factor is the Public Press, especially the big dailies, all of which are indorsing the Farm Bureau and practically all of which refuse to publish articles criticizing and exposing the cotton contract of this association; second. State Bankers Association of Texas; third, the Chambers of Commerce, which are in each county heaquarters of the Farm Bureau; and fourth (by acquiescence), practically all cotton buyers and merchants. These influences, no doubt, have been secured because the Farm Bureau promises not to disturb the existing order of trade.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The deplorable conditions relative to the price of cotton are the result of the shameful manner in which the price of cotton is made by the Cotton Exchanges, which are chartered</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by the National Government. These Exchanges have for fifty years been determining the price of cotton. The members of the Exchanges produce no cotton, seldom buy or sell any, and spin no cotton; yet they are permitted to price cot- • ton. This they do by a system of gambling— betting on futures. With' Exchanges operating, the price of cotton must fluctuate from day to day; else there would be no inducement to gamble in the game. There can be no stability to the price of cotton so long as it is controlled by gamblers. This is the system that prices (otton at the present time; this is the system that permits speculators and profiteers to get into the game and to handle cotton at their dis-cretion</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">, wh</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ile at the same time the millions of. producers of cotton have no voice in the pricing of their products. Results: Cotton has enriched every nation and people who have come in contact with it except the producers, whom it has impoverished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A rational system for selling cotton must insist that cotton be disposed of according to the universally recognized rule of business, viz.: standardize and properly label the cotton bale at the gin, where it is put into commercial form, pool this cotton, then sell it collectively by an agency selected and controlled by the cotton growers. The pride must be made, based upon the average cost of production, with something added for profit. Relation must be established between the cotton-grower, who pools the cotton, and the cotton-spinner, who spins the cotton. This can be done on the plan as above stated, of standardizing, pooling and guaranteeing contracts. With this done, the cotton-grower will be able to receive a profitable price for cotton, having it based upon cost of production; and at the same time the spinner will be able to buy cotton on a more stable and satisfactory basis than he now does. With the cotton standardized, growers can easily know what service their agents are giving, which is not the case v here agents mav cover up bad sales by under-grading. Undergrading cotton for the purpose of overselling the market is too often now the practice of farmers' agents. If, in behalf of the &quot;onsuming public, the Government ever feels impelled to investigate the factors governing the price of life's necessities, true conditions can be found if we begin at the beginning, with</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the cost of producing the raw material, and build our industries upon this foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Now, to return to the theme of the Farm Bureau. Recently one of the officials and directors of the Marketing Department for Cotton in this association in Texas, made the statement to cotton buyers, at a State meeting in Galveston, that the Farm Bureau does not propose to interfere with the present system of selling cotton (the gamblers' system), that there will be only another cotton merchant in the field. 1 now desire to call attention to the specific items in the enclosed cotton contract. You will observe that there is nothing in this contract guaranteeing that relationship will be established, or even seriously attempted to be established, between cotton-growers and spinners. It does not promise to get the cost of production, to say nothing of profit, on cotton. It does not recognize cost of production as a basis for determining tjie farmers' prosperity. It does not agree to hold cotton for any price which may be necessary to sustain its production. The leaders do not believe in farmers putting any price upon their produce. It binds the farmers in an irrevocable contract for a period of five years, to sell to this association cotton immediately after ginning, regardless of price at that time, while the association proposes to pay for this cotton whatever amount they feel that they can afford to pay for it, at the then existing market conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the event the farmers shall find themselves discriminated against and desire to change these conditions, or should undertake to withhold from a further pool of their cotton, this contract imposes a penalty of five cents per' pound, or approximately $25 per bale, against growers on all cotton withheld by them, should they fail to carry out this part of the contract, even though in equity they might be justified in withholding further from the pool. In the event the farmers should find it necessary to appeal to the courts for aid, or recovery of actual damages sustained by them, the contract requires them to pay all cost of litigation, including witness fees, traveling expenses and necessary attorney's fees. At the same time this association, which requires so much of the farmers, recognizes no more obligation to them, according to this contract, than to the general</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">public. As they can have no control over it after it goes into the speculator's hands, the speculators, or buyers, constitute the “public” they are to protect. But who will protect the consumers against the middleman’s greed? If , farmers </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> make large profits, it would, at least, have the virtue of stimulating production, but for all, the profits to go to middlemen acts • as a two-edged sword, decreasing both produc</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">tion and consumption. In other words the al-&gt; leged servants of the farmer, instead of rendering efficient service, by selling cotton at a price which will sustain its production on a basis of actual cost of same, appropriate to themselves the right to sell it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at their discretion at any time, anywhere and at any price which they themselves deem proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">My motive in calling your attention to these details, is that you may put these facts before the readers of Tub Golden Age. If I have rendered any service in thus calling attention to the manifestly unfair system by which it is proposed to perpetuate the present plan of selling cotton under the prices made by the Exchanges, instead of selling cotton as all other products are sold, on a basis of investment in same, I ehall feel amply rewarded. I shall be pleased for you to study the enclosed contract, and make whatever comment you may deem advisable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE dog and the wolf doubtless had a common ancestry, since crosses between the two </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">animal</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">s have the ability to reproduce their kind. However, in speaking of the dog in this article, we do not associate him with the wolf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The dog has ever been a valuable servant and companion to man. Ancient man used the dog as a protection against fierce beasts and as a means of procuring game before gunpowder was invented. Today the dog still renders valuable service in warfare against cunning animals, such as the fox, the wolf and small animals which prey upon poultry. He is also of much value in aiding the hunter to procure game and in trailing animals that have been trapped. Perhaps his service as watch-dog is best appreciated by. housewives and timid folk, and least appreciated by trespassing burglars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The tendency of the dog is to specialize; and thus various breeds have been developed. Soma of these breeds are valuable chiefly in catching deer and large game; others for catching birds; and a breed trained for any specific game loses its value if permitted to pursue other than the game for which it has been trained. Some breeds of dogs, such as the St. Bernard, have a remarkably well developed instinct; and others, like the bloodhound, have very keen organs of smell, rivaling those of other beasts. Man, with his degraded intellectual and perceptive powers often attributes to the dog the power to reason. This is not to be wondered at when it is known that man and dog formed very close attachment for each other in pioneer days and earlier; but</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">scientific investigation proves that the dog ia governed entirely by instincts which are often highly developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The dog, like man, often develops undesirable and faulty hgbits. One of the most undesirable traits he may develop is that of preying upon domesticated animals, in particular the sheep. Sheep-killing dogs are a nuisance much dreaded by the shepherd, who often places poisoned bait for such dogs, since rarely a dog-owner acknowledges his dog at fault unless the beast is caught in the act. Thus innocent and valuable dogs are often destroyed, and the anger of their owners aroused, in many instances terminating in feuds and manslaughter. Some man may have a dog which develops the habit of robbing hens’ nests, and despite his wife’s protest will persist in keeping the dog at the expense of his poultry yard. After maturity dogs can rarely be trained to habits either good or bad; and from this fact has come the proverb, “It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the ancient Egyptians the dog was an object of veneration. This accounts for the name “dog-star” which they applied to the star Sirius, also an object of worship. The learned Pythagoras taught that at death the soul of man entered into various animals, the dog in particular; and for this reason a dog was often held to the mouth of a dying man in order to catch his departing spirit In Ethiopia the dog w’as worshiped as a god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hebrews, however, held the dog in dis-esteem. He was thought to symbolize the gentiles — outcasts. In prophetic language Isaiah refers to a class existing in our day, a class of men held in high esteem by Christendom's rulers. He says: “His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogsfD-Ds, Reverends, Very Reverends, Most Reverends, and Doctors of Divinity]; they cannot bark; dreaming, talking in their sleep [margin], lying down [lazy], loving slumber [ease]. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough: and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way [welfare], every one for his gain, from his own quarter [denomination].&quot; “They shall gather to themselves teachers having itching ears [for praise of men]; and they shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables.&quot; &quot;The -priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money.&quot; (Isaiah 56:10, 11; 2 Timothy 4:3, 4; Micah 3:11; see also Philip-pians 3:2) All intelligent minds should be able to discern the appropriateness of the prophetic appEcation. *</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>What’s the Use?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ONDERFUL and progressive, from the-viewpoint of the scientist, were the results described by Oscar Riddle, of Carnegie Institute, before the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He had been seeing what he could do in developing the physiological processes* of birds. Males responded to the tortures faster than females. Birds were subjected to oxygen pressure, and developed into monsters. The result reminds one of the surgical operation which is a success, but the patient dies; for all the birds died, the males outUving the females.&quot; If the process could be developed, and the birds not die, it might be possible to induce artificial development, determining sex in advance. If, if, if—and no tangible or valuable result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Flies and rabbits came in for the attention of other scientists. Salamanders were fed cattle brains, by Dr. E. Ehlenhuth, of Rockefeller Institute, New York, and grew three times their normal size. Only cold-blooded creatures responded to this diet; anyway, if the experiments did succeed, there would be a shortage in cattle brains which might be used to feed the scientific mind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">One scientist earned a degree of Doctor of Philosophy—Ph. D.—by making certain expert-* ments.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are much troubled here by the behavior, the dress, the name prefixes and affixes of the clergy, especially the Roman and the Episcopal, who can never fraternize thus with the common people. Your clergy are probably the same kind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">N OPTIMIST is one who can rejoice when he sees the snow failing, knowing that it is good for the wheat crop. A Pessimist is one who grumbles and complains when he sees the snow, because he is afraid be will get his shoes muddy when the snow melts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pessimist is the one who is afraid to pluck a rose for fear of getting a thorn in his finger; while the Optimist on the other hand admires the beauty and delicate perfume so much that he overlooks the pricking of the thorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Optimist, when he slips on a banana peel and goes sprawling on the sidewalk, can laugh at himself because he has furnished some merriment for the fellow across the street; while the Pessimist, who comes along a moment later, and slipping on the same peeling, utters a thousand curses against the Optimist because he forgot to kick the peeling into the gutter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Optimist will always admire a beautiful picture; but if there is a fly speck on it, the Pessimist will be sure to see it. The Pessimist always sees the dark side of the storm cloud, while the Optimist considers the sunshine beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Optimist smiles when the chiropractor gives him an “adjustment&quot;, knowing that it will benefit him later; but the Pessimist thinks so much of the little pain he may have had that he spends his time telling others how rough the chiropractor was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pessimist doesn’t know how to smile; the Optimist knows not how to frown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">2 The Optimist won’t be discouraged; the Pessimist won’t be encouraged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">F LATE I have been doing considerable reading along the lines of the national characteristics of various peoples, and have adduced the following as indicating predominant traits in the peoples named: Negroes, religious and superstitious, inclined toward spirit worship; Russians and Slavs, dull and barbarous; French, fickle, frivolous, ardent and logical; Japanese, brave and enterprising; Spanish, proud, intolerant and superstitious; Italians, musical, excitable, inclined toward violence; Bengalese, cowardly and subtle; Afghans, fanatical, fierce and treacherous; Chinese, abnormally clever and abnormally stupid; Fingoes, braggart and timid; Zulus, brave and honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It appears from my studies that one race has great artistic tendencies, and another has none at all; one has considerable capacity for civilization, another has less; the Irish have one !nn&lt;f of temperament, the Scotch another. The United States seems to be the melting pot of the world. Why is this inequality among people so dominant! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">[Climate, education, environment and prenatal influence are four of the dominant factors responsible for present differences of color, temperament and characteristics. Facilities for transportation have an important bearing also, as does also the fertility of the soil As the earth approaches perfection, the climate becomes equable, education is widespread, interchange of thought, of goods and of persons becomes easy and the fertility of the soil improves, there will be a consequent lifting up of humanity wherever the original God-likeness has broken down. Most of all this will be accomplished by the power of earth’s new Ruler and the agencies of perfect government He will then have at work in every corner of the earth]</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EW THOUGHT is identifiable with Hinduism on the broad basis of the fact that all heathen religions contain an esoteric (inner circle) philosophy, the knowledge of which was anciently confined to the priesthood and sedulously concealed from the multitude of ignorant and superstitious worshipers. In India this once entirely esoteric philosophy first appears to have become popularized to some extent and to have spread among the masses. From India it was carried in recent years to-western lands and adapted to Occidental habits of thought as , New Thought. There seems to be no room for doubt that both Theosophy and Christian Science are derived directly from Hindu sources. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hindu philosophy of existence is based on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Upanishads,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> which*are classified into six </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sastras,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> and variously interpreted by three schools of thought: the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sankhya,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vedanta, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nyaya.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Nyaya teaches that the chief end of man is deliverance from pain. This is attained by total cessation from all action, good or bad. Perfectly simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sankhya school declares that matter is self-existent and eternal — which our Western scientists also, taught as an axiom until recent radio-activity studies convinced them that the elements are not immutable and that there is a leakage of energy which cannot be accounted for. This Indian theory further teaches that the soul is distinct from matter, and is also eternal. (Practically all heathen creeds embody the devil's first lie) When the soul attains true knowledge it is liberated from matter and from pain. (This smacks strongly of &quot;Science and Health&quot;, with its “development of spiritual understanding&quot; and the seif-cure of disease) The same Sankhya school declares the existence of God unproved. How strongly this agrees with the average opinion of scientific men!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The philosophy of the Vedanta school is embodied in the “Vedanta Sara” treatise, which maintains that “the whole universe is God”. (This is the “God mind” of Mrs. Eddy) “God is existence, knowledge and joy.” Ignorance makes the soul imagine that it is different from God, that it is a distinct entity. To show how closely these oriental ideas are copied in modem healing cults we quote from page 184 of “Christian Healing’:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The purpose of this lesson is therefore to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">take as a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">workable </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">principle</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the proposition that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">any ideal for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the body or mind or the spiritual </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">life, may be firmly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">held and steadily insisted upon, until it becomes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">reality in the realm of things. Ta </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">do this, we must </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">first attain to the state of consciousness with the Absolute Hffc Let us accept fully and without question, the corollary that whatever belongs to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Divine nature </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is inherently in us, ready to move up to full expression just as soon as we attain divine consciousness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The first half is true</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; the</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> last half seductive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ignorance, say the Vedantists, “projects the appearance of an external world”. (Or, as Mrs. Eddy would say. lack of “spiritual understanding” and “wrong thinking” cause the soul to accept the “false testimony of matter 7 Everything except God has only a seeming existence. (Mrs. Eddy again with her spiritual “oneness with God*' and the “illusion&quot; of the “carnal senses”) When He who is the First and the Last is discerned, one's own acts are annihilated. Meditation without distinction of subject and object is the highest attainment of thought. (Concentration or semi-trance for the admission of spirit control) It is considered a high attainment to say: “I am God”; but the consummation is reached when thought exists without object—when you allow </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">something else</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to use you as a medium for its thoughts! Indeed that seems to be the ultimate purpose' of New Thought: spirit control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s teachings alone among, religions inculcate real unselfishness, ^pddhism ostensibly teaches it, but so exaggerates and perverts the meaning of it that it becomes preposterous. Hinduism incarnates selfishness as the rule of life, and New Thought tacitly accepts this rule. The Atman, or doctrine of self, teaches that there is one great pan-self present in all human minds; and that man, if he be awake to his * supposed privileges, discovers his unity with this real or supreme self. In so doing he can justify his selfishness by reflecting that whatever he wills to do must be right, since he is part of God’s will. This is a very subtile deception, containing a powerful appeal to certain instinctive human desires. Most human beings retain a latent sense of duty’ toward fellow creatures, a certain realization that the law. ’Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” is just and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">proper/ But Buddhism explains benevolence as conferring benefits on dissociated fragments of one’s self. So it justifies selfishness, calling altruism enlightened selfishness. This is Mrs. Eddy almost verbatim; and all New Thought justifies selfishness and declares the unity of our selfhood with that of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The denominations of Christendom today urach Hinduism rather than the gospel of Christ; though in so doing they ought to include unexpurgated studies of Hindu mythology, art, ceremonial and social customs, and laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Most heathen religions have their &quot;holy trinities”; Babylon had its Anu, Ea, and Bel; Egypt its Osiris, Isis, and Horus; so the Vedic triad was Agni, Vayu, and Surya—fire, air, and sun; and later Hinduism had its Brahma, Vishnu, -and Siva, or the Creator, Preserver, and De-atroyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Paranas. sacred hooks Vishnu is the most important deity of one sect. According to the doctrine of Avatara, Vishnu from time to time, through the ages, descends to earth and is incarnated in a human life. Krishna was one of these Avatars- He came to live on earth for the &quot;preservation of righteousness and destruction of wickedness”. Buddha, on the contrary, •ay the Hindus, lived to promote the overthrow of religion and to lead humanity to destruction. Krishna’s life was one of unmitigated lasciviousness, which his worshipers have thought well to emulate, according to his example; and they have commemorated these things in obscene pictures. Yet this is the god whose latest Avatar certain Theosophists pretended to discover in a Hindu boy whom they brought to the United States a few years ago to be educated for his mission of the new Messiah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only in the Krishna myth but throughout, Hinduism is polluted with unspeakable depravity. Indeed the Hindu’s moral sense appears ’ to be atrophied; for, arguing that God is the source of every sin, he feels no sense of personal guilt, except in the case of ceremonial defilemeat, or in the infraction of some one of the myriad religious rites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hindu really worships self in considering himself to be a detached part of God. In bo doing he is, of course, bowing before the devil’s master idea. That personage became puffed up with pride and considered himself worthy to determine his own course because he fancied</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">himself to be on an equality with God. Like Mrs. Eddy the Hindu believes that matter is a ’ : reflection of thought, and h essays: &quot;Where there &nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is faith there is God”. If you have faith in a stone, then, it becomes God, veritably. So, hav- ' ing a superabundance of faith, he lavishes it <sup>1 </sup>upon three hundred and thirty million gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">His religion inspires and sanctions the most *■ cruel and revolting customs. It is saturated with snake worship and all which that implies. . Its keynote is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">despair.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Yet from this, and its offshoot Buddhism, springs that pernicious _ system of error, New Thought, which in one form or another is virtually the religion of ths present day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The modern European applications of these Ideas lead on toward spiritism. The celebrated Maeterlinck has published a lot of profound flummery about od, the &quot;liquid of life,” that magnetic vital fluid that is said to emanate from men and mice in uninterrupted waves; and not from animals<sup>4</sup> only, but from vegetables and minerals. According to this theory, “holy water” is efficacious because it is water mesmerized by a priest possessed of psychic powers, who charges the water with curative suggest tions. It is obvious where this twaddle leads to —even though there may be the weakest shim-met of truth in the odyllic theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">These theories gently pave the way for spiritism; for it is alleged that the seven hundred authentic apparitions recorded by the Society ' for Psychical Research are merely &quot;odyllie manifestations from beyond the grave”. This ia the Maeterlinck philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Thought prepares the mind for spiritism. It also, by encouraging intense selfishness and “incarnating” the human will (that is, by letting the desires of the flesh be the determining factor in the life), leads to universal jealousy, suspicion, and hatred; and eventually to anarchy. Myriads of people are short-sighted and never count the cost, but consult only the temporary and immediate gain. Flamboyant promises of “success”, of “get what you want”, of “power of will”, and all the rest of their bespangled but morbid companions, are made to a curious, ambitious, and befuddled world, which does not realize that the greatest power on earth among men is not the power of the will but the power of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">honesty.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Absolute frankness of purpose and life is more potent than aB</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the false psychology and semi-voodooism which could be examined into a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But to those who think differently New Thought appeals. They do not realize that in . nature there are certain well defined laws which keep the world in order, standing as walls to separate the things of intrinsically different functions, and that if these are broken down the result is chaos. This latter-day world is undermining its own mentality. Divine law limits man's<sup>-</sup> activities according to a just appreciation ’’of his capacities and welfare. It appreciates the fact that his meddling with certain occult mysteries will prove disastrous to him; but disregarding this law, man is being permitted willfully to break down those walls which might protect him. It seems alluring to be admitted to the feP'iwship of those superhuman intelligences thuc urgently invite it. But they admit man not once as a guest of honor, but always as a victim. In former times these powers to work mischief were limited; but now they are being allowed to entangle themselves in a net of their own weaving, from which they cannot extricate themselves, or be extricated, save by divine power. Surely, in spite of all its boasted inventions, in spite , of all its scientific wonders, the world of today is a terrible place to live in—not an unsafe place for the Lord’s people in view of divine power, but an undesirable place from the standpoint of human happiness. It has become too complicated and too fantastic. The insidious enemy has bewildered human understand-i n g with subtile sophistries and ingenious - delusions. He has undermined the-human will, while persuading humanity that its own will is God. As for the Lord’s people in the midst of this hubbub, they properly take heed to the command : “Stand ye in the ways<sub>x</sub> and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest to your souls”.—Jeremiah 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed hope! That we shall enjoy rest and peace and purity and sanity and honest brotherly love not only now in the midst of this turmoil, but fully when our glorious Master and King assumes His great power and reigns. This rest and peace and understanding will then come to fill all the earth. Where else is there any hopeT What has Science, or New Thought, or Theosophy, or Hinduism in any form, to offer to those who have no hope—the vice-wrecked, the crippled, the blind, the incurably diseased, the spawn of the fetid slums, the bereaved parent or child ? How can anyone i-eject the reasonable terms' of the gospel to pin a faith in the vague and nightmare uncertainties of spiritism* with its proven lies and impositions, its weird and preposterous shadow-world, its malicious and spiteful influences, its<sup>1</sup> shuddery possibilities? On the one hand is the vision of a sane, &quot;decorous world, wherein exists justice, peace,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and safety. On the other an Omorka abyss, peopled with irrational dreams and monstrosities. Should not any one fear death, if it meant a plunge into this frightful unknown, populated with gibing, unrepentant evil spirits, and distinguished even more by conscious pains and terrors? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New.Thought and Spiritism promise nothing, ’really tangible in the way of hope and consolation. Only the message of present truth, Bibletruth dispensationally understood and applied, does that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW THOUGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I am glad that there are people who boldly take issue with New Thought. In the “Finished -Mystery” I discovered some very illuminating ideas with reference to this—ideas with which I ‘ thoroughly coincide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For many years I have suspected that our marvelous latter-day civilization would terminate in an appalling cataclysm, although until recently Iwas not aware that there was Scriptural warrant for such an opinion. The ethics of the New Era have appealed to me as fallacies; and the popular exultation in the new freedom from the trammels of world-old standards of morality, as fatuous self-deception. While preaching evolution and altruism, the world has been fostering actual degeneracy and the most egregious selfishness. Contrary to the prevailing optimistic views I seemed to observe that corruption was creeping over the world. All seemed to be afflicted with an insidious, malignant malady—a disease, not of the fleshy but of . the spirit. This disease had toxic qualities, which stimulated and intoxicated, while it poisoned, deluding the virtuous with a spurious reinvigoration of vitality while undermining -their mental and moral stamina. It was impossible to have confidence in the world’s future, with the world under this spell. It confounded faith and made a mockery of hope, laying open to suspicion every profession of goodness as being either self-delusion op hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I think today that practically every one has accepted the teaching of New Thought in some form. It is the travesty of the Holy Spirit, founded on the esoteric philosophy of Hinduism, which has been adapted, to Occidental prejudices and popularized to become the forerunner of Spiritism, for which it prepares the mind and the heart. Nevertheless, in spite of its antagonism to the truth, it has unintentionally served the truth by disproving the contentions of higher critics and skeptical scientists that the supernatural is an absurdity. In revising their theories to admit “psychic law” the scientists and the higher critics have been driven to con- ’ cessions which render untenaWe their whole position with regard to the Bible. “Psychic law” obviously cannot furnish a plausible explanation for many of the Bible miracles; but if it is conceded that part of them are possible, it becomes illogical to dispute the rest merely because the laws governing them are not yet understood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Apparently all systems of belief- which conflict with the Scriptures are based on common fundamental errors. The sober scientist and the heathen mystic express the same ideas in different phraseology. The materialist argues that there are “only two actualities in the universe”—force and matter. In fact, he asserts' that radium discoveries, by disclosing matter to be a form of force, prove that there is only one. Between this view and that of the Sankhya philosophy of Hinduism there is a very close analog)<sup>-</sup>; for the latter declares that the universe is composed of two materials, akasa and prana. Akasa is the all-pervading essence out of which matter is formed. Prana is the infinite,. omnipresent power that transforms akasa into the material universe. Say the Hindus: “Gravitation, magnetism, thought, nerve-force, physical power — all are manifestations of prana. At the end of every cycle of existence . all matter resolves again into the original akasa, and all powers melt back into prana, existing as potential, instead of active, energy until the universe is recreated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The lure of New Thought is in its promise of super-human powers. I fancy every one has dreamed of flying through the air and exulting in the possession of, this power which no one else had. The Hindu yogi pretends that it is . perfectly feasible to acquire this power, and not only this, but the ability to walk unharmed on knife-blades, to flash light from his body, hear with the unaided ear sounds many miles away, . <sup>1 </sup>to enter corpses and animate them, to take pos- -session of living bodies and make them do his will, to read the mind, and to see spirit beings. . He claims that, not'only can he cure his own physical disorders by the power of his will and indefinitely prolong his life, but that he is able’-to make over the texture of his body—reconstruct it in such a form as pleases him. The , Rajayoga system, which like Buddhism is a development of the Sankhya philosophy, is the source from which New Thought 1ms drawn most of its alleged knowledge of psychic laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it any wonder that people, especially those of . natural mediocre capacities, should be tempted ■ by the promise of such extraordinary powers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Rajayoga teaches the cultivation of pranayama, or control of prana, /whereby the yogi expects to acquire unlimited control over the \ forces of nature, until he is able at will to swerve^ the planets from their orbits and to cheek the proper motions of the stars. It is strange that with so many aspiring yogis in existence our stellar map has remained unchanged throughout the ages, exclusive of apparent changes due to the precession of the equinoxes; for within recorded history there is no mention of any audacious yogi ever succeeding in dimming the . • coppery glare of Arcturns or in checking for an instant its three-hun«Ired-nfilc-a-second rush through space. Nevertheless, Rnjayoga claims to teach how this may be done: for it credits its super-adepts with such a plenitude of prana--yama, and in consequence such rapid vibra- -tions, that their influence is irresistible, so .that distant multitudes, entirely unaware of the' -yogi’s existence, will quite unconsciously obey his will. Very ingenious and plausible is the reasoning in the mystic philosophy of the . &nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hindus, and easy enough for the tolerant investigator to be beguiled into its web; for it elaborates a system based on pretended laws of nature which modern science cannot deny -w may have a foundation in fact. The Rajayoga , . purports to put magic on a scientific basis, -transmitting it to the prosaic Occident in the <sup>r </sup>form of New Thought. ■</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To some minds New Thought appeals as a <sub>hf</sub>- process of evolution, embodying soul evolution. The principle of evolution is an ancient concept, . especially discernable in Taoism, the doctrine ; of Lao Sze, the &quot;Old One”. Likewise it is a feature of the Sankhya philosophy, which ex‘ plains a cycle of evolution whereby matter is „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolved from soul and resolved into soul again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Like some Western scientists, the Sankhya ■ - school decides that God is &quot;an unnecessary hypothesis”, declaring nature to be “the mate.. rial and efficient cause of the universe”. It <sup>J</sup> supposes three sets of materials in nature. The highest manifestation of nature is Mahat, or “universal intelligence”. Each human mind is part of the cosmic intelligence. Buddhi, or intellect, is the individual Mahat. The mind fuhc-r » tion is to collect and carry impressions to the intellect, and the latter determines upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' Chitta, the “mind-stuff&quot;, is the engine wliich draws prana from the surroundings, and inanu-factures it into various vital forces. Buddhi is the finest state of existence of the materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The next stage is egoism. Next is the Tanmat rad, which cannot be seen, but only inferred. The Tan matras combine, become grosser, and produce the universe. Every day we constantly throw out good and evil Tanmatras, which are visible only to the acute perceptions of yogis. Churches and temples are holy because of the • good Tanmatras of worshipers which linger . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there. Buddhi, or intellect, is the first muni-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">festation of nature, from which all other manifestations proceed. Perception comes through the eyes, which carry it to the Indriyas, or sense-organs. These transmit it to Manas, the mind, which conveys it to Buddhi, the determinative faculty. The latter passes it on to Purusa, the soul, which receives it and gives it back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ Purusa is iniinat^rial. immortal, and infinite in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">number. It is immutable; but in Buddhi nature </span><span class="font7">first appears as imperceptible </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">matter, gradually growing grosser through various stages until * . it arrives at its grossest stage of actual, tangi-L • ble matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hindus say: “Mind is the instrument in the hands of the soul, with which the soul catches external objects”. Mrs. Eddy plagiarized this thought when she asserted that matter is ♦ a reflection of mind, or sp<sup>;</sup>rit. But she rather followed the Vedanta school, which declares</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that -Para Brahm, the Supreme Being, (the “God Mind” of Christian Science, the “absolutely totalized consciousness of the universe” of Emmanuelism, the “God within us” of Pantheism, in general) is the only verity; and all else is Maya, or illusion. But Mrs. Eddy harmonizes with the Sankhya doctrine in its dogma that the Purusa, or soul, is free, being merely joined to the body through ignorance. The *Sdea of a body is ignorance”: the soul is potentially divine; the goal of a yogi is to free it, through “psychic control”, from the limitations of normal existence. His instrument is the practice of Samadhi, or perfect c&lt; ncentration, whereby he achieves Pranayama, or control of the forces of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• New Thought tacitly instructs its votaries that the supreme- duty of man is the cultivation of the will. Its unconfessed thought is that the will is predatory, growing at the expense of other wilfi. One of its fascinating rewards is telepathy. The yogi cultivates Samyania, or perfect control of the mental powers, whereby he is able to “know any tiling in tne universe”: and to read the mind like an open book—still reiterating the ancient promise, “Your minds shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole tendency of these teachings is to inspire a presumptuous sense of equality, with the Deity, and a denial.of sin.- Says the yogi: “Silly fools tell you that you are sinners. It is downright rascality to say so. You are all God. Is not the whole universe you!” That is the point they wish to emphasize—that sin is an obsession, that e^il is non-existent. Mrs. Eddy cordially endorses this assumption. Once you accept, the cunscience is lulled to rest, all your latent selfishness is justified, and your “suppressed impulses&quot; are allowed free expression. What does it mattei* what peccadillos the flesh is guilty of, since the flesh is merely a shadow? How can one's acts injure another’s shadow? If the whole universe is you, have you not a right to do as you please with your own? Why should you waste sympathy on another’s woes, when you realize that the suffering is self-imposed, resulting from a train of “wrong thinking” (as Mrs. Eddy calls it)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Very subtle are their arguments, and subversive of moral sense, though difficult to refute with&quot; the unaided human reason; for if you</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">admit the premise that there is no inflexible standard of right and wrong, your judgment is snared, and the imagination may be convinced of anything. I think that the Almighty, realizing the' limited capacity of our little brains, must have formulated simple, beneficent rules for our guidance in the affairs of life. He did not explain the underlying reasons for these laws, because He knew our little finite under-Btandings could not grasp them. But we, in our arrogance and our presumptuous Conceit, repudiate His code, and so expose ourselves to cope unassisted with the wiles- of intelligences far more subtile and vastly better informed concerning the mysteries of nature than we ourselves, and whose sole purpose is to bewilder us and to bring us to ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Thought is intrinsically insincere. Unctuously it reiterates virtuous platitudes, prating of humanitarianism, temperance, reverence, benevolence, charity, honesty, mercy, good will to all. Then it teaches you how to ignore all the virtues, in fact, how to infringe the rights of others and to persuade yourself that you are benefiting them. It counsels altruism, explaining that it is &quot;enlightened selfishness”, shows you how to make selfishness the road to salvation. The yogi deprecates hypnotism or faith-her<sup>i;</sup>ng as very pernicious, and immediately discloses a means whereby you can obtain absolute control over another's being. Most New Thought cults instruct you how to cure ill-health and to correct bad habits in others &quot;without their knowledge”, by influencing their wills. Consoling yourself with the reflection that it is &quot;for their good”, you are taught to encroach on the most sacred rights of others and to cultivate a p.v thllesome and mischievous attitude toward your fellows. All this leads to a spirit of mutual annoyance, intolerance, distrust, suspicion, antipathy and, eventually, hatred. The goal is universal anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We used to wonder at the credulity of our forefathers and of the heathen with their belief in gkvsts and devils. Now we find influences at work that upset the false security of our materialism. All about us, though yet unrecognized. are the invisible hosts of malignancy, striving as throughout the ages to instill every evil t bought into our consciousness. Pos-sc-..’'<sup>1</sup>'- smue inkling,of the Divine Plan, these evil intelligences suggested monstrous imitations of its various features. Even the mysterious symbolism of &quot;the bride of Christ*, they apparently travestied grossly in the Hindu doctrine of Matthura, or &quot;perfect love”. This, according to them, is the highest stage of love, when the whole being is shaken in frensy with J inexpressible love of the Deity. The Bhakta, or devotee, voluntarily foregoes his hope of Nirvana, preferring to remain a separate entity through interminable cycles of existence rather than reunite with the Absolute. As a separate . entity he can experience indefinitely that love which recognizes all humanity as women, and Para Brahm, the One Man in existence, as his husband. So the Bhakta does not try to elude the law of Karma, which visits on one life the accumulated good and evil acts of previous Eves, but which the Hindus claim affects the • material welfare only, but cannot destroy the glory of the Purusa, or soul, which cannot be acted upon by anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Another New Thought analogy to Hinduism is the conception of Christ as merely a great spiritual or &quot;psychic” leader. The Yogis claim to possess a peculiar knowledge, or tight, called Dharma Megha, &quot;the cloud of virtue”. They say that aU the great prophets 3f antiquity had discovered this &quot;foundation of knowledge within themselves”, which the Buddhists call the &quot;state of Buddha”, the &quot;condition of infinite knowledge, infinite as the sea”—a state of peace, calmness and perfect purity. They claim that Jesus attained this condition, and became the Christ; and that all men may likewise attain it after they arrive at the state of Vairagyam, or renunciation—non-attachment to the attractions of the senses, when it becomes apparent that life is disillusionment, that no one succeeds in fulfilling his desires, that pleasure and pain are equatiy distributed and inseparable, and that love decays and is reaUy selfish. The purpose of the whole of nature is fo^ the soul to gain experience, so that it may be reabsorbed into Atman, or Infinite Self, of which it is a detached fragment. This is much like saying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that a man runs a race so that he can return to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Earth’s Oldest Empire</span></h4>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N DAYS when thought turns to leagues and associations of nations, world courts and &quot;super” states, it comes with a slight shock to be reminded that.there exists, and has existed for fifteen centuries, a super-government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is not within the scope of this article to delve much into the musty past, but rather, as was the custom two decades ago in all the leading journals—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Forum,</span><span class="font12"> the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">North American Review,</span><span class="font12"> etc.—to discuss this subject freely as a matter of current importance, and to bring out into the light the present condition and acts of this Super-State of the World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">'We scarcely need remind our readers that this is an examination of systems, not of individuals. No personalities are intended. Where individuals are mentioned, it is as the well-meaning but deceived agents of systems. There is no thought of malice—nothing but a sincere desire for the time when all will be freed from a great delusion, ami therefore for the genuine well-being of every man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning 'all truly beneficent movements, it is properly said, as Lowell puts it, that there “standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The common people are greatly beloved of God. “God must have loved the common people; He made so many of them,” observed Lincoln. Jesus said. &quot;God so loved the world [of common people],that he save his only begotten Son”. God speaks ofulelivering “th£ poor and needy”. He declares that He will “destroy the oppressor”. The people are the Father's special solicitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Behind all evil movements—any that directly or indirectly £ail to result in the common weal— stands another gdd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He is the adversary of mankind, the master politician of politicians, who plays one group pgainst another, in the determination to maintain and extend his pernicious control of the common people. This master mind is a mighty and super-wise, invisible and evil spirit. He works through an invisible organization of spirits like himself, and through the minds of organized classes who profit through his reign— through Big Business, the politicians, and through the ambitious and unscrupulous clergy. His name is Satan. He is “the god [mighty one] of this world”, or order of things. He is the “prince of this world”. He makes the undisputed claim that the power and glory of the nations of this world are delivered unto him—Luke 4:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not Merely a Church .</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12"> GLANCE into history of two thousand years ago shows that the then civilized world was ruled by a super-state, the Roman Empire. When in due time the reins of super-government slipped from the inert hands of the Roman Empire, they were almost immediately taken up by the great empire which to this day exercises or seeks to utilize governmental power, not merely over the hundred millions of peoples, but over the entire world. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The papacy is commonly, but mistakenly, regarded solely as a church; but that it manifestly does not correspond with the coinm'only understood definition of a church—“a number of Christians organized for united worship”— is evident from the considerations which follow —not that there is not a number of Christians organized for united worship connected with this system, but that this church is exploited by the super-system and utilized for the purpose of maintaining and extending the world super-government of this political entity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The degree of culpability of the most of the so-called “clergy” who are implicated in these un-American practices, is much like that of an agent of the Empire under consideration, wh® became informed on the subject, and ceased his activities' in behalf of the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“I nursed my religion from my mother’s bosom,” says he; &quot;my religion was born and bred in my bones; and I was taught at my mother’s knee that there was no other church that had a ghost of a chance of eternal salvation. . . . Up to a few years ago I was of the opinion that, my life had been well spent, but today I firmly believe that the major part of my life has been spent in erroneous doctrines and nonsensical teachings, as the broad light of wisdom and independent thought has penetrated the dark recesses of my bewildered conception of right and caused me to look upon things in general in an intelligent m</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">er From this time forward I am going to endeavor to undo, as nearly as possible, what I have helped to accomplish in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Upon such’ a man rests little culpability. It is to help many innocent men to understand what they are doing, that this article is written.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Curia Romana</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N THE dark ages the court of a medieval monarch was termed his 'curia”. The &quot;Curia Romana” is the political court of the world monarch who presides over the affairs of this empire. There is also an ecclesiastical “curia” for religious purposes, which is the center of the Roman system. It is the “Curia Romana”, or political center, with which we are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The monarch of this empire is the Pope. This title is not an exclusive one. It means &quot;papa”, or &quot;father,” and in the early Christian church was applied to any bishop, and today is the title of any priest in the Greek Church. Like the “Curia” it is one of the many ancient terms brought down from antiquity, and kept in use. However, outside of the Greek Church, the appellation “pope” is now applicable only to the Pope at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The &quot;Standard Dictionary” recognizes the political standing of the Pope, in the definition, “formerly ruler of the States of the Church, and still recognized as an independent sovereign”. The Pope, in fact, is as much a sovereign as is the king-;Qf England, or of Greece, or the former Kaiser of'Gennany, the late Czar of Rbssia or the present Emperor of Japan. That his is a super-state appears in his title, “King of Kings,” and in his claims to world sovereignty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Origin of five Erhpire</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">fT'HE 0 ri gift of the Papal Empire is thus traced by a Catholic writer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“When the Roman emperor lost Rome and all his possessions in Italy, they were abandoned to the barbarians. The emperors made no effort to recover them, and automatically lost civil authority over the people. The Pope then became civilly independent of the Roman emperors. His relations with them were purely spiritual. He never acknowledged civil subjection to ’ the new states that sprang up in Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Analysis of this interesting bit of tradition shows that it amounts to the refusal of a church to submit to a new government when a change in government takes place, as though the Methodist church had refused to submit to the Harding a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">dmin</span><span class="font12">istration when Wilson went out of power, and thenceforth had claimed for itself civil independence of the United States. The Methodist church could not defy the national government; but in those days the Roman Catholic church was too strong for the weaker governments of the times, and thus laid the foundation for the existence of the Papal Empire. The power-seeking clergy paid no heed to the apostolic injunction, “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers .... The powers that be are ordained of God . . . One must needs be subject . . . for conscience’ sake . . . for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing. . . . Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.” (Romans 13:1,2, 5, 7) It was therefore in a state of sedition and of insurrection against the powers of early times that the Papal Empire was founded, and it is still seditious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“To say that the Pope can be subject to a temporal prince, is to say that the soul is subject to the body, heaven to earth, or God to man.” “The Pope has the right to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ul state laws, treaties, constitutions, etc.; to absolve from obedience thereto, as soon as they seem detrimental to the rights of the church, or those of the clergy.”—Canonical Law at Prague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Archbishop Mannix of Australia recently stated that “he did not consider himself in the least bound by any of the governments. . . The orders were no more binding on him than if they were made by the Shah of Persia.” The papal Syllabus of 1864 says of the Roman Catholic system: “She has the right to hold kings and. princes to her jurisdiction, and of denying their power as superior to her own in determining questions of jurisdiction”. Pope John says: “Princes have no laws to give, but humbly to expect them from the Church. They have to obey, and make others obey.” Pope Leo</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The governmental system of the papal empire consists in practice of the following graded officials:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. The Pope, the actual or nominal head.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. The so-called “Black Pope”, the head of the powerful Jesuit order, often the power be-<sup>1 </sup>hind the throne.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. The Papal Secretary, sometimes more powerful than the Pope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. The Cardinals, or Princes of the Church, organized in\a s&lt;^-called &quot;College of Cardinals”, divided into cardinal bishops, cardinal priests, and cardinal deacons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. The Archbishops, in charge of provinces called Archdioceses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">6. The Bishops, in charge of territories called Dioceses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">7. The Priests, in charge of territories called Parishes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">A confusing factor is that the same persons act both as government officials for the Papa! Empire and in a religious capacity for tl-.c churches just as the Protestant “clergy” act in a dual capacity, and are both politicians and ministers. Many people know nothing or little about the governmental side of the system and think of the various officials and territories in their religious capacity alone. This misapprehension is cultivated by the Hierarchy, as the system of officials is termed, because it affords a blind or camouflage behind which the civil operations of the Papal Empire are carried on, until such a time as, in a given country’, the system considers itself well established enough to stand unveiled before the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">HE governmental system of the Papal Empire is rather a bureaucracy than an autocracy. It may operate as an autocracy, with the Pope as sole ruler, the capacity in which he is commonly set forth before the world. If the Pope should chance to be neglectful of his duties, or be imbecile, insane, or relatively weak ' in character, the government functions the same as under a strong Pope—the orders, pastoral letters, buds, and so on, coming forth as though by the Pope, when actually proceeding from the bureaucrats nominally subordinate to the head. Such a bureaucracy was seen in its perfection in the government of the Russian Czar, where the actual rulers were the Grand Dukes and their associates, and the Czar was utilized by them and made responsible for the acts and orders which they originated but which he signed. This fact was finally recognized by the Russian people; and when they deposed the Czar, they made a clean sweep of the Grand Dukes and the entire Russian bureaucracy. A not dissimilar condition existed recently in the United States, during the period when President Wilson was incapacitated to the extent of unconsciousness for some days and of utter incapacity for a longer time and when the Cabinet officers were not permitted to function in charge of affairs. The government seemingly ran on as usual, the orders were given by heads</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">of bureaus, and such matters as the President had been accustomed to attend to were duly cared for by men close to the sick man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The bureaucracy at Rome consists of departmen t s or bureaus termed “congregations”, twenty or more in number and each consisting of cardinals, consultors and officials. The chief departments are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. Congregation for interpretation of the decrees of the Council of Trent, which in 1545 condemned the Protestant Reformation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Congregation of sacred rites for decisions regarding- liturgy, rites, ceremonies, and creation of new saints. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. Congregation of the index, to condemn publications deemed prejudicial to the Papal Empire or the churches.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. Congregation of indulgences and sacred relics, two substantial sources of revenue.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Since the Council of Trent. 1545 to 1563, the system has been able to dispense with general (ecumenical) councils of the entire church. Such councils, composed of bishops from anywhere and everywhere, are liable to bring up matters not wished discussed in public by the Papal Empire, and -prejudicial to its interests”: and for the past few centuries the system has been able to get along very well, with the *'congre-gations” taking the place of the more democratic councils that characterized the early church. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Five Hundred &quot;Religious” Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HERE is a large number of religious bodies, or orders, about five hundred in number, organized to promote or help carry on the political or the religious activities of the Papal Empire of the world. The most important and active order numbers some twenty million members and is known as the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits, organized in 1540 for the principal purpose of fighting the Protestant Reforma-tibtjj then strongly under way. The officials from the highest down are: (1) General of the Jesuits, sometimes termed the Black Pope, as distinguished from the regular or White Pope, who is often controlled by the Jesuit head; (2) The Vice-General, next to the General; (3) The Professed, who are priests of mature age and of eminence in learning, to whom alone are committed the important affairs of the order, and who constitute the Society proper; (4) The</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coadjutors, who have no part in the election of a general, but participate in general deliberations, and from whom the heads of Jesuit </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font12">colleges .and religious houses are chosen. The membership is bound to regard any superior » officer as in the place of God and to obey im- ?. plicitly all orders given them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Among the items in the Jesuit vows are the t following, as authenticated in a Paris court of ’ law in 1761, revealing the political attitude of &lt;&nbsp;all Jesuits: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Pope hath power to depose heretical kings, • | princes, states, commonwealths and governments, all ’ being illegal without his sacred confirmation, and may j safely be destroyed. ... I shall and will defend this 1 doctrine to the utmost of my power. ... I do renounce </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical king, &lt;&nbsp;prince or state named Protestant, or obedience to any of their inferior magistrates or officers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the oath or vow taken by a cardinal is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I swear ... to try in every way to assert,-uphold, preserve, increase and promote the rights, even temporal, especially those of the civil principality, the liberty, the honor, privileges, and authority, of Holy <sub>; </sub>Roman Church, or our lord the Pope and the aforesaid &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">.successors. ... To combat with every effort . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rebelling against our lord the Pope and his successors.” |</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The oath of a priest includes the following: |</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pope . . . has power to depose heretical kings, ■: princes, states, commonwealths and governments, all i being illegal, without his sacred confirmation; and that 1 the v may safely be destroyed. Therefore, to the utmost ; of my power I will defend this doctrine and His Holi- -ness’ rights and customs.' ... I do renounce anil disown any allegiance as due to any Protestant king, prince or stare, or olx'dience to any of their inferior officers— . I do further declare that I will help, a.si.-t and advise all or any of His Holiness’ agents, in any place, wherever I shall be, and to do my utmost to extirpate the Protestant Doctrine and to destroy all their pretended power, regal or otherwise.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These portions of the vows cannot be construed as religious, but are political and exhibit the un-American position which those that take them are oath-bound to maintain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Papal “Americanism”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE foregoing represents correctly the “regular” attitude for every faithful Roman Catholic to take toward the church, the Papal Empire and eivil governments, as prescribed by the official law of the Empire. No admonition occurs more frequently in Rome’s literature than the adjuration to &quot;think as Catholics&quot;, that is, in harmony with the position taken by the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Among the political professions of Roman Catholics are: &quot;The Catholics of the world are Catholics first and always; they are Americans, they are Germans, they are French, or they are English afterwards”.—Priest D. S. Phelan, St Louis, Missouri. Says the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet,</span><span class="font12"> of Brooklyn, organ of the bishop of that city: “The Roman Catholic citizen of the United States owes no allegiance to any principle of the government which is condemned by the Pope”. Bishop Gilmore of Cleveland, Ohio, said in a Lenten letter: “Nationalities must be subordinate to religion, and must learn that they are Catholics first and citizens next”. “We do not accept this government,” affirms </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic World,</span><span class="font12"> “or hold it to be any government at all, or capable of performing any of the functions of a government; if the American government is to be sustained and preserved at all, it must be by the rejection of the principles of the Reformation, and the acceptance of the Catholic principles, which is a government by the Pope”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In consequence of the attitude required of Roman Catholics under oath to the Papal Empire the Constitution of the Republic of Brazil, adopted 1891, contains the following provision:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Article 70, paragraph 1: The following shall not be registered as electors (voters) for state or federal elections. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“4. Members of monastic orders, companies, congregations or communities of whatever denomination, subject to vows of obedience or rules or statutes, implying the surrender of individual liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">More than one country which has been troubled by the insistent plottings of Papal Empire agents against the government has been obliged in self-protection to expel from its borders every Jesuit or other person under oath or rule of the kind mentioned. _____ </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">REVIEW of the nature of the Papal Empire and its agents is necessary to a grasp of the significance of the present activities of what the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font12"> has termed &quot;that international nuisance, the church-state”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Prior to 1914 the number of ambassadors or ministers credited to the papal court—the Curia Romana—was fourteen. This year the countries actually represented, or soon to be, are about thirty. The published list is a little indefinite;' but the five represented by ambassadors are Peru, Chile, Prussia, Brazil and Spain, evidently countries in quite full agreement with the empire in important respects. According to the Catholic Press Association the others are Argentine, Austria, Bavaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, Germany, Monaco, Great Britain, Hayti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Holland, Hungary, Jugoslavia, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, San Domingo, San Salvador, Uruguay and Venezuela. Others expected soon are Finland, Esthonia and Latvia. Some of these are merely hopes. Great Britain sends a representative, but refuses to receive one and is not sure about continuing the arrangement. France has been in the quite doubtful column, as blooming hopes were somewhat wilted by a sudden reaction against the idea. British information is to the effect that the representation of Great Britain and France was. a temporary war measure entered into to counteract the plotting going on at the Vatican. Recent happenings in France disclose a strong coalition in the Government favorable to maintaining reciprocal diplomatic relations with the Papal Empire. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Owing to British censorship and propaganda, cable despatches emanating from London ure notoriously ■ unreliable, but according to the London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Post</span><span class="font12"> the proposition that the United States send a representative to the court of the Papal Empire was under consideration, secret negotiations were under way, through the late Wilson-Romanist administration. For quite a number of years this country was represented, until the break between Italy and the Vatican in the seventies. The fact that the 1920 Republican victory at the polls was in no small part a determined effort of the people to free the United States from the measure of Papal Empire interference with Americanism that prevailed during the World War, makes it quite out of the range of probability that the Administration would flout its constituency by so reactionary a proceeding as the establishment of political relations with the medieval Papal Empire. President Harding has definitely repudiated the plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">*'Concordats” or Treaties</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font12">X THE antiquated and deceptive lingo of this ■*- monarchy, a treaty with a foreign power is termed a &quot;concordat”. Diplomatic relations usually have to be preceded by a concordat on as favorable terms as the Empire is able to ’ exact. These concordats are often drafted in touch a manner as to interfere obnoxiously with the internal affairs of the countries entering them. For instance, before the World War a concordat was made with Servia. Not a few of the people of Servia are educated men, who have attended universities in Europe or 'America or the Roberts College in Turkey, where they have imbibed freely of the spirit of modern liberty. When weak King Milan of Servia, who lost his home standing because of disgraceful love affairs, made a concordat with the Vatican practically giving over the control of the educational system to the Papal Empire and the Jesuits, and placing church property and Romanist ecclesiastics out from under Servian law and courts and under the law and courts of the Papal Empire—the Canon Law, so called — it was too much for some of the liberty-loving Serbs, particularly the young men, who had hoped for a free Servia. Austria, which had been thoroughly under Papal Empire control, had assisted in the intrigues which saddled this reversion to medievalism upon Servia. A Servian college student, fired with indignation and seeking an objective for his wrath. shot and killed the heir to the Austrian throne, the man who had been most conspicuous in the betrayal of Servia. The bureaucratic government of Austria-Hungary, iimler papal management —like the papalized French government of 1921 —made demands upon Servia, impossible for a self-respecting people to comply with, opened war against that unhappy land, and started the fire which promptly became the holocaust of the World War. A staggering price is still being paid for this item of Papal Empire internied-dling.yvith the spirit of the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fact that the Papal Empire is a superstate, above all other countries, appears further in the terms imposed upon any country which makes an exchange of representatives. Ordinarily in the<sup>1</sup> circle of diplomats at the capital of a country that ambassador takes precedence who has served longest; but under the rules of the Congress of Vienna—capital of papal Austria — which is recognized in the capitals to which a Vatican ambassador is accredited, that official immediately becomes dean, or head, of the diplomatic corps. It would seem strange indeed to see America, founded by Puritan Pilgrims and dedicated to liberty, giving the supreme place in Washington circles to a Papal-Empire ambassador, while the American Ambassador at the Vatican court took last rank among the ambassadors there, as being the last to begin to serve at the Curia Romana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If the Pope Came to America</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE suggestion is sometimes heard that things have been getting warm in Italy, and that in due time the Vatican and the Pope might move to the United States, and occupy that duplicate of St Peter's and the Vatican buildings—the $5,000,000 &quot;Shrine of the Immaculate Conception”—a cathedral now under construction at Washington, on the Catholic University grounds. Most </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font12">ericans imagine that the coming of the Pope to America would not be different from that of any other very prominent clergyman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If the Pope were to come to the United States, he would necessarily come as a ruler, king or sovereign, indeed as a super-sovereign, recognizing no equal and no superior. He would retain and exercise in this country all his sovereign power and prerogative. The American people' would behold the anomaly of a separate and distinct sovereignty within the borders of the country, and not in any sense or degree subject to the sovereignty of the government of the United States, or of any State or municipality. Wherever the Pope made his headquarters, say for example at Baltimore, Maryland, the status of his palace and of his church and the grounds connected with the Papal Empire plant, would be that of a separate nation within the nation of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Within the sacred precincts of the papal plant the legal rule would be that of extraterritoriality, like that of civilized foreigners in certain semi-savage countries whose offenses are not permitted to be tried by the local courts, but only by courts of foreign countries. A criminal escaping from any part of Baltimore to the papal plant could not be touched by the Baltimore police, any more than if he had slipped out to Canada or to Mexico. To get-such an</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Spain and countries such as those in South and Central America. For a while after the initiation of the World War the Teutonic empires were actively represented at the Vatican. Then England and France (informally) and other countries which found themselves measurably out of the current of diplomatic affairs unless represented at the papal court, sent representatives to the place where more diplomatic wires crossed than at any other national court Governments of even Protestant countries found tt as inadvisable to stay away as it would be for an individual to attempt to market stocks without a stock exchange—the Curia Romana was the center of so many, of the important currents of world politics. Individual governments have only their ora country as a source of information, with diplomatic representatives helping, but the Papal Empire is a world-wide affair, with thousands or millions of subjects in every land and nation, in business, in finance, in poll-tics, and in every conceivable kind of affairs, and possesses, as a super-state, an advantage overwhelming in character. It is able to bring, internally through its oath-bound local subjects, no small pressure upon governments not yet represented at the Curia Romana, as well as externally by withholding its cooperation and that of its subjects in matters necessary to the welfare of some unrepresented government</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Governments, with rare exceptions, are composed of politicians, devoid of real devotion-to principle and ready to grasp at diplomatic —straws or planks; and the Papal Empire is able to offer some quite substantial advantages, for representation at its court—hence the recent scramble to get in. The more numerous and powerful are the governments represented at the Curia Romana, the greater to politicians seems the necessity of being represented—it grows like a snowball rolling down hill. So to quote </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Current History,</span><span class="font12"> “The Vatican is again a great power in world politics&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Everywhere politicians are turning for help to an Empire which by a nod can incite or quiet turmoil, unrest or disorder in almost any country on earth. The politicians of the Vatican, as the assembled departments of the imperial government are termed, being autocratic in tendency, favor autocracy, and have no hesitation in keeping alive the hopes of throneless kings wherever to do so serves their purpose.</span></p>

Demands for surrender of such criminals, if refused, could be enforced only by declaration of war and the siege of the pap*al plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• The Papal Empire would maintain at Baltimore its own army, or at least the nucleus of it, equipped with arms and munitions and separate from that of the United States. If the plant fronted the water the empire might have its own navy, composed of one or more war vessels. It would bring to Baltimore the Pope's aerial navy, consisting, according to press reports, of the two airplanes now held at the Vatican for a possible hasty exit from Italy. It would have its own wireless outfit for secret communications with foreign governments. Unless prevented by treaty with the United States, it would have the right to make such alliances with a foreign power, Germany for example, as would arrange for the filling up of the plant</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. with German troops fully armed and equipped for war. This was the case with French troops in the Papal States in Italy, when the Italian government made war with the Papal Empire, and on the dead bodies of fallen papal troops found the insignia and identification emblems of regular French troops belonging to regiments then existing in France, part of which had been detailed to service under the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As ruler of the Papal Empire the Pope would continue to receive the twenty or thirty ambassadors, ministers and representatives that now attend the Curia Romana at Rome, and the United States would be expected to send an ambassador or minister to the Pope and to receive one from him. Conditions like the foregoing actually exist today, and constitute an unsolved problem for the Italian Government.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>What Does a Nuncio Do ?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font12">HAT is it like to have an exchange of representatives with the court of the Papal Empire! This question arose in 1907 when the British Government was being importuned to take such action. But a nuncio (papal representative) had just left France, and his papers left in charge-of a subordinate were obtained by the French government. The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nation </span><span class="font12">for April 13, 1907, comments illuminatingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“A desire has at times been expressed by English Catholics to see a Papal representative resident in this country. The advantages of such a means of communication between the Catholic body and Rome are obvious. ‘Its disadvantages are even more obvious; and after the light thrown on the methods of Roman diplomacy in France, it is improbable that anyone who takes the .Vatican seriously will wish to see it directly represented among us. The English Catholic bishops are remarkable rather for the moral than the intellectual virtues. But they do not listen at keyholes; their bands are clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The government, if it erred in his [Mgr. Montagnini, the subordinate to the nuncio]regard, erred by overindulgence; for it was notorious that his house was a center of anti-ministerial and anti-Republican intrigue.

No one high or low is safe. M. Fallieres, M. Loubet, M. Rouvier, M. Delcas-e, play their part in the fantastic puppet show which presents itself to the Envoy’s imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;A contemptible figure, this Paul Pry of the Vatican; *&quot; and his employers-are, if possible, more contemptible than he; yet a menace to the public peace, which no civilized government can afford to tolerate; for he is the mouthpiece of what is ... a power in the world. Its presence is ubiquitous; its hands, its eyes, everywhere; nothing is too great, nothing too small for its interference. At the other end of the wire illustrious personages receive, record and welcome this mass of slander, fabrication and triviality. ‘I have nbt failed to make good use of the articles and books which you have sent me,’ writes the Cardinal Secretary of State; ‘I await further information; talk little; repeat everything; listen well’. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Three reflections suggest themselves on this miserable business. First, at Rome, truth for its own sake <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a virtue. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not one word that these men say can</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be believed. Solemnly,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> repeatedly, they have assured</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">us that the Pope's action in the matter of the Separation Law was taken on the all but unanimous advice of the French bishops. It was not so; and the highly placed ecclesiastics with whom the statement originated, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">knew that what they were saying was not true. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. &quot;Third, it is impossible that such a system should be lasting; the feet of the colossus are clay. To urge that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it represents religion is the merest sophistry.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> From</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">: first to last there is not a word of religion in this cv-respondence—of piety, of goodness, of zeal for souls. It is politics, corruption and intrigue throughout; the power behind it is one with which the ideal and material forces at work in society are alike incompatible; whose claims the' development of the conception of the State</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> had made it impossible for any modem Government to admit. The llontagnini papers have at least this merit, that they put the issue clearly; no one can doubt now</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1 what Rome means. The conflict is between two ideals of civilization, the dead and the living; sooner or later— sooner, probably than later—the living will win.”</span></p>

It is affirmed by Roman Catholic authorities that the church is not in politics.</span></p>

In Austria, according to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman,</span><span class="font12"> a Roman Catholic weekly at St. Louis, “the clergy ... counseled that the Catholic woman of Austria would not evade the performance of her political duty.... His Eminence [Cardinal Pifil] secured for all sisters and nuns, even those strictly cloistered, papal permission to take part in the elections. . . .

In Germany the Centrum [Catholic] Party has about a fifth of the parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Italy the Catholics or “Populari” have a compact voting block of 100 votes in the Chamber of Deputies. “The Clerical Party in Alsace-Lorraine is exceedingly strong.” says the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font12"> In Belgium “the Catholics . . . have come out with a clear majority”.

<p><span class="font12">In Portu g a i, according to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Tribune,</span><span class="font12"> of Dubuque, Iowa, “the Catholics have organized a political party for self-defense. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Having stirred up the people, the Bishops</span><span class="font12"> have brought about the establishment of a Catholic centrum with its own press organ, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Union.-</span><span class="font12">The hew organization has sent a telegram to the Holy Father pledging its loyalty to the Holy See and guaranteeing the united determination of the entire body for the defense of Catholic interests.

<h6><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The Nonpartisan Me thod</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N EUROPE the Roman Catholics come out into the open with Catholic parties under various popular, democratic or even radical names; but in the United States they do not as yet have a separate national party, but employ the Nonpartisan League method of seeing that good Catholic candidates appear on all tickets, so that a Papal Empire subject may win, whatever political parties succeed. Their church members are instructed when either a Protestant or a Catholic may be voted for, to vote for the latter, and to vote for the one of two Catholics who is the more devoted to the “Church&quot;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Many non-Catholics,” says the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Missionary, </span><span class="font12">a Catholic journal, “fear us as a political organization and are afraid that the Catholic Church will dominate and rule. We are working quietly, seriously and I may say effectively”. ‘.‘Undoubtedly,” says Dr. O. A. Bronson, a Catholic writer, “it is the intention of the Pope to possess this country. In this intention he is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">aided by the Jesuits and all the Catholic prelates and priests.”</span><span class="font12"> Says the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Sun:</span><span class="font12"> “The Pope has given the order to make America Catholic. . . . The first step in the making will be the election of one of the American Cardinals to the Papacy and the removal of St. Peter’s to Washington, [then] every non-Catholic will be driven out of the army and navy.” “If the church,” says Dr. Bronson again, “should direct the Catholic citizens of this American Republic to abolish the Constitution, the liberty and very existence of the country as a sovereign state, r and transfer it to the crown of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte [or some other Catholic ruler], they are bound by a divine ordinance to obey”. The possibility or practicability of Roman Catholics, numbering 17,735,553 out of 105,683,108 American population, or 16.7 percent, seizing the reins of the government, was clearly demonstrated in Russia, where the Bolsheviks, reputed to number hut 600,000 originally, by force of compact and disciplined organization and well-planned acts seized and held the Russian government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N THE 1920 campaign candidate Cox was reported as trying to use the church in the fight for the League of Nations, in a hopeless attempt to carry on a campaign intended to take on the tone of a religious crusade. The effort was predestined to failure because the Roman Catholics number but a sixth of the population, and until much more numerous would not find it good politics to work through a Catholic party as in many other countries. The preponderance of Roman Catholics in the Democratic Party outside of the Southern states is owing to the fact that some twenty years before the Civil War that party seemed to be the one most likely to remain dominant and Catholics were advised to join it, evidently with a view to ultimate control. The Civil War and rise of the Republican party spoiled well-laid plans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">In Austria the attempt was recently made to five the national government over bodily to the apalEmpire. The Christian Socialist (Catholic) party tried unsuccessfully to make the country a fief of the Catholic Church; under an arrangement or concordat, the Vatican would directly govern Austria, the same as the Pope ruled over the States of the Church in Italy up. to about 1870. The Catholic parties in Europe^ especially are working together to create a powerful union of the national governments, <sub>4</sub> which they seek to control, on Dr. Bronson’s principle of &quot;patriotically” sacrificing one’s own country if thought expedient by the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;There are strong Christian Socialist elements,” says the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;in Italy. Bavaria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, whose cooperation is being sought by the Viennese leaders. The latter are stated to be negotiating with the Vatican in an attempt to obtain the Pope’s consent to their putting the suggestion before the'Allied. conference. . . . The transformation of the [Austrian] republic into a papal state would satisfy the desire the Popes have never abandoned for a measure _ of temporal power.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Austria, tried to do what Cardinal Manning of London declared England should do: &quot;The British mlhisters ought io apply to Rome to learn the civil duties of British subjects”. To help England into the straight and narrow path of Rome, Manning declared at Westminster before assembled prelates of the Papal Empire: &quot;It is good for us to be here in England. It is yours, right reverend fathers, to subjugate and to subdue, to bend and to break the will of an imperial race!&quot; At the University of Wisconsin, at Madison, Priest H. C.

<p><span class="font18">F</span><span class="font12">OR a decade or two there has been a noticeable drift in America toward the unificatioa of all the lay organizations of Roman Catholics. Shortly before the 1920 election a veritable panic of centralization took possession of Papal Empire officials in America. It seemed- to burst upon them that they were &quot;up against&quot; a sudden crisis of grave proportions; the imperative need was for the immediate organization of every resource for united action. The crisis was represented to the flock as an &quot;opportunity”. Whether it was bad news from Europe, or the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">immi</span><span class="font12">nent fall of the largely Catholic Democratic party, or a command from the Pope to Knights of Columbus at Rome to hurry up with “making America Catholic” will appear in due course of time; but as from sheep in a storm the cry went forth to “get together”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the World War the American hierarchy worked the army, navy, official Washington and the country at large through an agenoy called the National Catholic War Council. At the onset of peace the domestic activities of this &quot;Council” were taken over by the National Catholic Welfare Council, an organization designed to embrace within its bosom practically all lay activities. In it are organizations for men and others for women, sO that the energies of every willing worker may find expression.</span></p>

Cowardice would challenge heaven’s wrath in such a crisis!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The new central organization is avowedly the • hierarchy of Papal Empire officials. Says Dr. . Slattery: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Catholic Hierarchy of America, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">operating as the National Catholic Welfare Council,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> desires to unite ’ In the National Council of Catholic Men, our men of America and all our organizations of men. . . . Let us unite under the leadership divinely granted us, the Hierarchy of Mother Church [Empire].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is not a call of power, but the cry of weakness and<sup>-</sup>of the dread of impending danger. It makes manifest that—unfortunately for • the many good and sincere individuals — this 16.7 percent of the population who seek to control the government of the United States and to subjugate the American people to the Papal Empire see plainly a writing on the wall, “Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin—weighed in the balance and found wanting”. And the nearly ninety million non-Catholics rejoice that soon the rest of the sentence upon that Empire of Darkness will be divinely executed: “Mene;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished . it. Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Peres; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians [the common people]”.—Daniel 5:25-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Systematic Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">T IS interest! however, to observe the systematic organization of the hierarchy in action. The National Catholic Welfare Council has five departments, each under a bishop: Education, under Archbishop A. J. Dowling of St. Paul; Laws and Legislation, under Archbishop — now Cardinal — D. J. Dougherty of Philadelphia; Lay Organizations, under Bishop J. Sehrembs of Toledo; Social Action under Bishop P. J. Muldoon of Rockford. Ill.; Press ' and Publicity under Bishop W. T. Russell, of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Charleston, S. C. The men’s branch of the Lay &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Organizations Department is termed the Na-’ional Council of Catholic Men, into which Dr : Slattery's Macedonian cry is hoped to draw \ all the men’s organizations and most of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">other faithful laymen of America. The system &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">divides into dioceses, of which there are about</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">handrad, and down to parishes, where local • representatives will work to bind the laymen * and the women tightly into bundles—&quot;to burn . them”, as the Scriptures interestingly picture the divinely ordained dissolution of the system in the great time of trouble just ahead.—Mat-&gt; thew 13:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of up-to-date activities are to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">entered into and developed, to interest laymen. During the war the National Catholic War Council maintained an organization practically duplicating the entire army, navy an&lt;J civil .. organization of the federal government, with &gt;&nbsp;the purpose of &quot;assisting” government officials. .1 It is psychologically impossible to sustain such zeal as' a big fight awakens, without having another fight on, but the effort is being made:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The National Council of Catholic Men will develop</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the great flood of good will and splendid effort poured</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by our Catholic laymen for the winning of the war.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Financial Resources</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE financial backing of the Papal Empire is reputed to be immense, and undoubtedly is. But in such hard times as the entire world ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has seen since the war even the vastest re; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sources have been subject to unprecedented</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">; shrinkage, and incomes ample in 1913 for the &lt;&nbsp;work in hand now have to be doubled Or trebled ’ and in some countries multiplied by six to ten. Religious empires are having a hard time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priestly representative of the Empire in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">j Lynn, Massachusetts, has made the admission I that the branch managers are having a hard time , to pay all the bills for the care of the Sisters, parochial schools, etc., for the reason that the cost of living is so high and there is much less coming in than formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However in the United States in 1916, the latest available figure, the value of Roman Catholic Church property was reported in the - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1921 “World Almanac” at $374,206,896, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">* expenditures at $72,358,136, or 22.3 percent and 22.0 percent respectively of the corresponding United States totals of $1,676,600,589 and $328,809,999. ^Thih makes an average expense per</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I member of $4.60. as compared with Methodist i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$11.84, Presbyterian $18.72 and Protestant</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Episcopal $20.62. Owing to the drying up of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">i European streams of funds, Roman Catholic men are complaining in every direction about the increasing exactions of the priests. This makes it not unreasonable to think that the &quot;church expenditures&quot; reported in the “World Almanac&quot; do not include all the money which has been expended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The quite common custom of expecting every person entering many Catholio churches to deposit at least ten cents would in a year, with the ninety percent claimed of attendance amount to $4.68 per member. A former member of a church in the United States says that just before he left the church the amounts demanded had doubled and had reached the following figure; pew rent $2 to $6 a year; monthly collections 20 cents to 42 cents; July picnio $1,000 from 400 members, or $2.60 each; in 1919 the members were taxed for the picnic, but there. Was none; Easter collection $6; Christmas collection $S; baptism offering $6 each from godfather and godmother; wedding $25; burial $25; masses $2 up. In all, the dues for the family totaled $85 a . ear, and free-will offerings averaged $15, a total of $100 a year—$20 per member. Sodalities, Sacred Heart Societies and other organizations, parochial school expenses, etc., draw, out much larger sums from unwilling pockets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition, the church being in a poor neighborhood, the rector wished to move out, and insisted on having a new church to cost $100,000, paid for free from debt in five years. It was partly, says the man, to escape an unbearable financial burden, as well as to avoid the increasing arrogance of the rector, that </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">he left </span><span class="font12">the church, after he had learned a little about the truth of the Bible, and realized that, as concerned his future life, he was incurring no danger whatever.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In one drive for Catholic charities in New York city $969,801.88 was obtained. On the return of Cardinal Dougherty a purse of $500,- -000 was planned for him. In St Paul the will of Michael H. Foley left $75,000 to the church, besides something for the Knights of Columbus. In Quincy, Illinois, John Haggerty leaves all his property to the church, including special amounts for masses to help his soul, and a few others, out of an imaginary purgatory. In Brazil the bishop of Tabaute publishes a catalogue entitled “An Immense Treasure Acquired by Little Sacrifices”, with all kinds of proposi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">tions to get the coin from the people in the diocese, including cash prices on masses for the dead and on indulgences from sin. In Brazil people do not seem to know that John Tetzel died some four centuries ago in Europe, after starting the Protestant Reformation through the crimes promoted by bis trade in indulgences^</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Profitable Business</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12">TNDULGENCES are profitable. They have -*• often been farmed out, like county patent rights, or as taxes are fanned by oriental governments. Kohlrausch, a popular German historian, savs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The sale of indulgences was let out for entire provinces, to the highest bidders, or farmers-general; and these again appointed several subfarmers, who for the sake of gain committed the most shameful abuses. They selected men of eloquence and impudence to excite the minds of the people and to induce them to purchase by wholesale. They sold indulgences for the heaviest crimes committed; for pillage of churches, for perjury or for murder; nay, the promise of indulgence could even be obtained </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> the commission of the contemplated crime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is difficult to see that this is religion; and an institution doing a business of this sort is not even a business enterprise, to say nothing of a church, but is a criminal conspiracy which ought to be restrained or reformed, if not destroyed out of hand. The Papal system still sells indulgences in Spanish American and other semi-civilized countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Among the many auxiliary feeders to the clientele of the Empire are the various charitable institutions, including the Houses of the Good Shepherd, found in every sizable city. While doing much good, and tax free as church property, many of these institutions are operated for profit as laundries. The inmates are chiefly boy and girl orphans. Whether these waifs originate in some measure as illegitimate children, as in Cuba and other Catholic countries where illegitimacy is rife, is not within the pbrview of this article, nor is the question whethv &gt;&nbsp;the inmates are overworked, underfed, locked 'ip in cells for punishment, and more nr less neglected. These are moral rather than civil questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But tli'J? political influence of the Papal Empire has’fhnade America Catholic” to the extent that the ordinary magistrates' courts in certain American cities sentence girl petty offenders, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">including Protestant girls, to</span><span class="font12"> serve their t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ime</span><span class="font12"> in these religious institutions. According to the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sun and Herald,</span><span class="font12"> on July 20, 1920, a Protestant girl, Elizabeth Shultz, nineteen years old, of 33 South First Street, Brooklyn, N. Y., arraigned before Magistrate Folwell, a Roman Catholic, was sentenced and told that her actions merited </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a year in the House of the Good Shepherd,</span><span class="font12"> a local Roman Catholic institution. 'Tm a Presbyterian, and you are not going to send me to a Catholic home,” declared Miss Shultz, in dqz fence&quot; of her constitutional rights. ‘&quot;The other homes are filled,&quot; was the answer. After a dash for liberty, and the application of force by officers, this Protestant girl, ankles and wrists manacled, was delivered behind the locked doors and spiked walls of one of what Senator T. E. Watson terms ‘‘Rome’s slave pens”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These institutions, under the extraterritoriality of the Canon Law of the Papal Empire, are exempt from inspection by the constituted eivil authorities. In the State of Georgia there exists the Convict Inspection Law, requiring the regular inspection, by state or eity officers, of all penal institutions, including those of the Empire; but all attempts to make inspection have been defied by Bishop B. J. Keiley, of Savannah, and no Governor of Georgia has ventured to carry the law into effect. True to its seditious origin at the fall of Rome, the Papal Empire at its will flouts the laws of nations, states and cities, while posing as tlve sole depository of law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Pittsburgh, Pa., according to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pittsburgh Catholic,</span><span class="font12"> the financial report of St. Paul’s Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum contains the following items of operation in 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “Extraordinary Disbursements” included $17,608.59 on a coal mine, and $4,103.08 _ on laundry machinery. The total for year was $323,041.25, including a $153,561.77 payment on contracts for new school building. The year’s operations, after paying for the buildings, had a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">cash balance</span><span class="font12"> of $127,345.03.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some of these institutions, tax free, supply low-priced laundry service, in competition with commercial laundries, paying taxes. Some Americans patronize them. Those inmates who are sentenced by civil courts are essentially convict labor, deprived, however, of the ordinary and at best limited protection afforded by state inspection of factories, business places and charitable and penal institutions. The very comfortable income sheets of the sanctified sweatshops' suggest that there is a good profit in cheap-labor laundries, and that the Sisters, continually visiting homes and business houses for charity for the laundries, are crowned with success in their labors of love for the Empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">In Mexico so much productive real estate was owned or controlled, tax free, by the~ Papal Empire, that it became a political issue; and (he property was largely taken over by the government, and is now being doled out to the common people. In France a contributing cause of the upheaval of the Revolution and that which some tw&lt; decades ago disestablished the “church&quot; ami caused the confiscation of its property by the government, was the vast amount of French real estate directly or indirectly in the hands of agents of the Papal Empire. The amount of property owned in the • United States, not by the churches, but by the hierarchy through the bishops and cardinals for the Pope, including Roman Catholic churches, schools, institutions of various sorts—and laundries and coal mines—is roughly estimated to run to several billion dollars.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Extraterritoriality</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">T IS often a matter of comment that priests and other officials of the system appear to be practically exempt from arrest, or at least from successful prosecution in the civil courts. This is because there is tacitly in force in the United States the principle of extraterritoriality, which was mentioned as operative in case the Pope should come to Baltimore. Property and officials of the Papal Empire everywhere are in many respects subject, not to the law of the country, but to that of the Empire, the so-called Canon Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This law operates in many ways. In certain cities iKis said to be the boast that a faithful lay subject of the Papal Empire can commit almost any crime and “get away with it”. Roman Catholic convicts in prison, who can get in touch with the hierarchy, say that there are two ways bf getting out—politics and religion. A priest commits a crime, there is a spasm of subdued press publicity, the district attorney talks softly, the grand jury indicts, and after the public forgets, the indictment is quashed or dropped without publicity—and the offender, secreted safely in some, investigation-proof institution, is finally spirited off to another country, to enter upon a new field of endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Immunity of the clergy from prosecution is provided in the 1911 “Mutu Proprio Decree*' of Pope Pius X: “We enact and ordain that all private persons, whether of the laity or of the sacred orders, male or female, who without permission of the proper ecclesiastical authority, cite before lay tribunals any ecclesiastical person whatever, either in criminal or civil cases, and shall publicly compel them to be present in court, shall incur excommunication reserved in a special manner to the Roman Pontiff”. By the Canon Law the clergy are to be free from taxation: “Canon X. Without the consent of the Pope no tax or rate of any kind can be levied upon a clergyman, or upon any Church •whatsoever”. This is the origin of non-taxation of church property. If exceptions are observed, as in America, and France, it is to be tolerated under protest, only until the “church” becomes powerful enough to revoke the obnoxious regulation; for, “Canon VIIL The Pope has the right to annul state laws, treaties, constitutions, etc.; to absolve from obedience thereto, as soon as they seem detrimental to the rights of the church, or those of the clergy”-.—Canonical Law at Prague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Irresponsible Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">F ONE of the ■‘'faithful” gets into court, the value of his oath may be estimated from this authoritative pronouncement by the “infallible” Pope Innocent XI: “If any, either alone or before others, whether asked or of his own accord, or for the purpose of sport, or for any other object, swears that he had not done something else which he has done, or in a different way from that in which he has done it, or any other truth that is added, he does not really lie, -nor is he perjured”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The unreliability of Papal Empire adherents, including the governments of countries and their treaties, was spoken of by Oliver Cromwell in 1656: “Make any peace with any state that is Popish and subjected, to the determination of Rome and of the Pope himself—you are bound, and they are loose. . . . There is no Popish State we can speak of, save this only [France, as he imagined], but will break thair promise or keep it as they please, upon these grounds, being under the lash of the Pope, to be by </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font12"> determined.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is because the Papal Empire is conceived of as a divine super-state, to whose will the national governments are expected to bend In all things. Even on the basic Canon Law no reliance can be placed; for being the creation of the Pope it can be altered by him at will: &quot;The Pope alone has the right to define the limits of his own authority”.—Cardinal Manning, of England. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thus in the Papal Empire exists a wholly irresponsible power of an extent limited only to the physical power at the command of its head. It is the outside limit of autocracy, and in a world fast turning toward the full light of liberty it has no place. The world cannot be made ’‘safe for democracy” until this evil genius of the dark ages reaches the end divinely decreed.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has dften been said of poHticians that they always “have their ears to the ground”. Up to within a very few years, until the World War made it a certainty that the world was going democratic, the Papal Empire was against republics and government by the people. It was Boman Catholics that assassinated the greatest man America has ever produced, who was obnoxious to the Empire with his advocacy of “government of the people, by the people, and' for the people”. The Papacy naturally favors kings, as easier to manage than entire peoples, wherever kings can be made popular. Many of the republics which were to be established under the &quot;self-determination of small peoples” now have kings instead of presidents, as Poland with a constitution calling for a king; Hungary, just self-dedicated to King Charles; and Greece, where republicanism was chased out in favor of Constantine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Variety of Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12">NEW phrasing of democracy has been invented to meet the pressing need of seeming to favor government by the people. &quot;The Pope,” says a Paris despatch, “faced the necessity of recognizing democracies or of politically disappearing from the diplomatic world. Pope Benedict has frankly announced his choice of the former.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The great outstanding fact in the world today,” said the Pope in a letter to Cardinal Lucon of Rheims</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">France, “ia tha everstrengthening current everywhere toward democracy. The proletariat classes, aa they are _ called, having taken the preponderant part in the war, desire in every country to derive therefrom the maximum of advantage.&quot; ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Papal Empire, however, will necessarily ; remain an autocracy until its end; but the better <sup>T </sup>to control the common people, these religious politicians announce that “politically the Vati- ‘ can has joined hands with democracies and cast its lot with the new world-wide liberal movement. . . . The Vatican will hereafter accept democracy as the only source of political power, and will work to build up and permanently * establish democratic government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A few years ago the Infallible One denounced as heresy the doctrine that rule should proceed from the people—then he was courting Kaiser </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Wilh</span><span class="font12">em and the Hapsburgs. In 1890 Pope Leo XI 1.1 declared that &quot;the sovereignty of the people ... is well calculated to flatter and inflame many passions, but . . lacks all power of insuring public safety and preserving order’*. Since then democracy has brightened its hue; for in 1919 Bishop J. P. Carroll of Helena? Montana, speaking ex cathedra declared: “The conditions most favorable to the growth and prosperity of the church are freedom and peace, and these are more likely to be guaranteed in a democracy than under any other form of political rule&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The 1919 formula is, “The people </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">under God </span><span class="font12">are the source of all political power. This they transmit to their rulers. . . . The Catholio Chureh has nothing to fear from the new worlddemocracy. She welcomes it with radiant brow and a heart full of confidence.” (Bishop Carroll, in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Oatholic Mind,</span><span class="font12"> May 8, 1919) This, how- . ever, was before the 1920 election, when the Masons and other non-Catholics began the final process of turning the Papal Empire out of America. The key to the new formula is the words “under God”; for no one in the orthodox sense is “under God” unless he is under the , Pope, who, verily, is held to be “God on earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The English historian Macaulay says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The experience of twelve hundred eventful years, ; the ingenuity and patient care of forty generations of &lt;&nbsp;statesmen, have improved that policy [of Rome] to such perfection that, among the contrivances which have been devised for dec•■■iv': g and controlling mankind, it , occupies the higlv'.-t place”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">j John Henry Shorthouse, author of “John I ' Inglesant”, comments:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Springing from the worst traditions of decadent । Pagan Borne, the Papal system never was a church. It never was anything but a propagandist machine for extracting forced obedience and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">alma</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> from an ignorant, a deceived, a t.-rrified world.

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">T HAS , already been shown that separate from and imposed upon the Roman Catholic ! churches proper, which as churches have the same right to exist as other religious bodies, there is a claimed world empire, the Papal Empire, seeking through an ambitious and ! avaricious hierarchy to exercise dominion over all the governments and over all the activities of every kind of all the peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">, It must be understood that these activities are' partly good and partly bad. It is a privilege to give credit to the self-sacrificing activities of innumerable Roman Catholics who as 1 priests, members of orders, or as laymen and laywomen. are doing a wonderful amount of good in the world, as befits people who profess to follow Jesus in His work of doing good. All praise to them! But among them have crept ambitious persons who have sought to exploit the church proper as a mechanism for the amassing wealth and exercise of civil power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That some of these men have conscientiously believed that this was their duty and privilege cannot be doubted, nor that many have consciously done evil. Put whether right or wrong in intent, the papal system as a civil agency has demonstrated to the utmost degree the innate possibilities of the union of Big Business, the church ijnd the state. The judgment of the world of thinking men is that such a combination is evil in the extreme, and that throughout the entire world it ought to be prohibited.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>“Make America Catholic”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">T IS the avowed purpose of the Papal Empire to &quot;make America Catholic”; that is, to subjugate the United States to the will and the dominion of the Empire. Great hopes are expressed. &quot;There is a consensus of opinion among all Catholic leaders,” writes Jesuit Kiev. J. Danihy in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Western Watchman,</span><span class="font12"> “that the opportunities of the Church in America are greater now than at any time in our history.” Mr. Slattery, who is Executive Secretary of the Bishops’ “National Council of Catholic Men,” adds: “With the establishment of the National Council of Catholic Men there comes for the Catholic people of America the birth of a new era of life and action, of hope and achievement”.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not merely the Catholicizing of America is the anticipation. Hope reaches out with wide vision, and Priest F. L. Gratiot says: “Our ideals are the world’s hope”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“An accusation,” says the organ of the Cathplic Foresters, “which is brought against us is that we want to make America Catholic. It is true, as far as it goes, but it hardly begins to tell the whole truth. The fact is that we want to make the whole world Catholic. . . . If the whole world were Catholic, there would be no discordant religions [i. e., no Protestantism—Brackets are the Editor’s throughout], no sectarian animosities, no duplication of religious work. There would be one Faith, one Church, one standard of ethics, one rule of conduct. . . . The kingdom of God [the Papal Empire] would have eome.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In America Archbishop Dowling of St. Paul says that excellent progress is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Yesterday we had nothing, we were nobody. Today, as in Tertullian’s day, we discover that we fill the land. We are millions; we are firmly established; we are deeply rooted; our churches are everywhere; our schools are being multiplied; our institutions are legion. No church in the land can assemble such crowds, can marshall her men in such thousands, can count her children by such millions. It is the welcome phrase of our orators and our preachers. It is the vibrant note of our most acceptable seers and prophets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Yet every adherent of the Papal Empire knows that athwart the path lies the shadow of a cloud—the storm cloud of liberty-loving people, that in country after country has blotted the Empire out. Every resource of the hierarchy is being strained to postpone a little the day when the American people shall take the Papal Empire in hand; for then this medieval autocracy must depart to its European habitat— provided that Europe will then have it</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Progress in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE acts of the subjects of the Empire are properly to be interpreted in the light of its published policy. In the United States, when one considers how small a proportion of the population are favorably interested in the Papal Empire, remarkable progress has seemingly been made toward occupying and consolidating places of power as a vantage ground for further operations. Hany of the higher strategic positions are intended to be occupied by Empire officials; but until the membership of the Empire increases considerably, only the lower places of influence are taken. For example, where it is impossible to have a presidency, a governorship or a mayorship held by a loyal Empire subject, the position of private secretary or of chief clerk answers; for all the work of the official necessarily is executed through the lower assistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Where business presidencies or general managerships are as yet inaccessible, the superintendencies or the foremanships afford a complete control of lower personnel of a business, as well as advantage ground for direct influence on the men at the top. The occupying of any position means the rapid filling of all possible lower places with Empire subjects and the weeding out of unfriendly non-Catholic persons, with the practical certainty that, as office boys naturally rise to presidencies, the higher places will in due time be held by Romanists, and the entire force be Catholicized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not a few non-Empiro managements, perceiving the transforming process going on in their organizations, have found it desirable, for the interests of their business, gradually to discharge Empire managers, superintendents and foremen, and to weed out the unhealthy overproportion of Empire workers. This process is now going on in New England and in other industrial sections of the country. In some instances this is done in a fanatical spirit; but in most cases it is executed as an ordinary business precaution, to minimize a tendency for blocks of employes animated by a single external purpose to act at times in a manner prejudicial ^0 good business policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the French Catholic portion of Canada it is a matter of common observation that the management of mills is affected unfavorably by the united action of employes acting in harmony with the suggestions of the local priest, who in mueh of French Quebec reigns supreme in local education, industrial, religious and civic affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the federal government the tendency to monopolize Empire forces has appeared. In the Civil Service Government Printing Office, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Navigation the constant drift is toward Empirizing the personnel of the offices, Under President Wilson’s Papal-Empire administration seventy-percent of the appointments were Empiristsr— altogether too large a proportion in a country where they number but 16.7 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fact is that religion should not enter at all into the matter of public appointments; but it necessarily does, owing to the fact that it is made a business by agents of the Papal Empire, who are determined to place that organization in a position where it will be able, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">as the supergovernment of the world,</span><span class="font12"> to dictate its will in all branches of human activity, political, economic, industrial, educational and religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Statistics compiled by persons interested are to the effect that 90 percent of the police in cities of over 10,000 population are Catholic; a majority of the councils of 15,000 cities and towns are Catholic; 62 percent of all the offices, elective and appointive, are held by Catholics; 75 percent of the teachers in the twelve largest cities are Catholic; 90 percent of the New York State officials and employes are Catholic; and so on—indicating a zeal for possession of places of power and influence worthy of a better cause than the subjugation of a free country to the medieval Papal Empire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The arrival of a cardinal prince at an American port does not mean merely the coming of a higher kind of clergyman, but that of a sovereign prince, who can be officially received only with delegations of officials, trainloads of subjects, processions, brass bands, and a throne flanked with the highest civil officers obtainable. “A prince of the church is dead. A mighty chieftain is fallen,&quot; declared Cardinal O’Connell, of Puritan Boston, in the eulogy at the imposing funeral.of Cardinal Gibbons at Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Kneeling in the “prince’s” church were the official representatives of Great Britain, France, Belgium, Poland and the South American nations, Governor Cox, representing the State of Ohio, Governor Bitchie, representing the State of Maryland, and Postmaster General Will Hays, representing the President of the .United States.

<p><span class="font18">J</span><span class="font12">UST what are the conceptions of liberty of this medieval institution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Listen to Jesuit Frederic Siedenburg, Dean, Loyola University, Chicago, recount in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">_______________________________„„______ ... ,,,,___________________________________________ . ...........----- ... .</span><span class="font6">।</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Mind</span><span class="font12"> the achievements of Pap'al Empire agents, as he interprets them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“It was a bishop of the Church, Stephen Langton, who inspired the barons of Runnymede to force from King John the Magna Charta, the liberties of England and of the world. It was the representative of the Church who reaffirmed the body of our civil law, habeas corpus, trial by jury, and no taxation without the consent of the taxed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning the Papal Empire’s connection with Magna Charta the following </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">facts</span><span class="font12"> may be of interest as illustrating “history” as written by Jesuit pens:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Pope Innocent III,” says </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New Age,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “the ruling pontiff at that time, strongly condemned Magna Charta and excommunicated the English barons who had been instrumental in compelling King John to grant it. Stephen Langton, the primate of England, refused to publish these excommunications and was therefore suspended from his functions as Archbishop of Canterbury by Pandulf, the Pope’s legate; and his suspension was confirmed by the pope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Listen<sup>1</sup> again to Jesuit Siedenburg, and try to figure out if you can, how much of what he says is fully supported when all the facts are considered; for the Jesuits as editors, authors and professors are systematically doctoring up history to make it appear that the Empire always favored the things that are now popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“And who shall recount the social services of the Church ? During the wars and upheavals which ravaged Europe century after century, she built every bulwark to defend the weak and the persecuted; she secured the right of sanctuary to the oppressed; she enacted canons against the wanton waste of human life ; she instituted the Truce of God, which arrested the cruelties of war during the latter part of each week. Thus was the Church ever the champion of the weaker nations and members of society; she stood h tween the Roman master and his slave, between the feudal baron and his serf, as she stands today between the profiteering capitalist and the exploited wage-earner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thus is history adorned for the faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘‘Reasonable” Liberty</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19210622_files/g_E_19210622-13.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">U T what of liberty! Benedict XV in a pastoral letter to Cardinal Gibbons expresses it in the phrase: “Retaining a most firm hold on the principles of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">reasonable</span><span class="font12"> liberty . . . ” It is important to see how the American meaning of liberty must be modified to conform to the adjective “reasonable”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A further complex appears in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Le Matin’s, </span><span class="font12">of Paris, analysis of the Vatican’s aims: “Adaptation to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">democratic</span><span class="font12"> spirit in the West, support of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">monarchical</span><span class="font12"> reaction in Central Europe, and temporal and spiritual colonization in Eastern Europe”. In other words, a “liberty” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">reasonable</span><span class="font12"> enough to cover democracy and autocracy&quot;—to include Abraham Lincoln and one of the bloodiest tyrants of modern times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In France since the Dreyfus affair, in 1896 the uncompromisingly Catholic monarchic-clerical party has incessantly intrigued against the liberties safeguarded by the republican form of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“In Portugal,” says </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Monitor,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “the bishops of the country have steadfastly defended the rights of the Church [Empire] and the liberty of conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is this a new and genuine liberty acceptable to prince and pauper, radical and reactionary, autocrat and martyr—or is it a fresh and impudent juggling of a sacred principle with phrases moulded 0 r hidden 10 deceive the thoughtless until, bound in dark-age fetters, they see themselves taken captive again in snares of words and phrases, to an ancient and bloody tyranny?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>What “Reasonable” Liberty Is</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE phrase “reasonable” liberty carries the same thought as &quot;under God”—i. e., under God’s representative, the Pope of Rome. Unquestionably the reasonable and logical atti- , tude -of a created being toward his Creator is one of obedience; and this is the essence of Christian liberty, because the law of the God of Love is so kind and broad as to permit and j encourage the utmost development of that lib-' erty of action which does no harm but only good to any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But it is not such a subjection as the Papal Empire asserts is its right from all mankind, and which it is ready to enforce as soon as it grasps sufficient civil, military, naval and economic power. It is a one-man liberty—freedom for the Pbpe of Rome alone in the whole world, with absolute and cruelly enforced submission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Papal Empire “worked” this “reasonable” liberty upon Europe for hundreds of years. Whether it be liberty or not let the dark ages, the Pilgrims and Puritans who fled from the Empire spirit to inhospitable New England, answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This strange &quot;liberty” is explained in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The - &lt;&nbsp;Providence Visitor—</span><span class="font12">the brackets are ours, for I clarity of thought: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ ___ . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Those who would find the authority for government <sub>w</sub> aolely in the will of the people may have desired to secure a free field for human activity, but true [reasonable] freedom is possible only under the authority [the* Pope] that protects it. The first requisite for civil government is that it have stability. The only -real. -T stability ia that which is founded on God [the Pope]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">because God [through the Pope] is the one immovable, immutable and eternal. The doctrine that authority . comes from God [the Pope] through the people recognises the right of freedom for human activity, and at the same time gives to government the necessary element of stability.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">the right to require the State not to leave every juration of Papal Empire agents to their sub- man free to profess his own religion,” affirms jects to “think always as Catholics”, i. e., with Pope Pius IX. .</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The brackets convey the intended thought that the Pope is “God upon earth&quot;, and their insertion illustrates what is meant by the ad-pernicious mental substitutions in expressions which seem perfectly harmless to non-Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, such language, unexplained, deceives the simple, who throw up their hats when they hear phrases they love coming from the mouths of representatives of the super-government of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The clergy dogged the unfortunate’s steps to the gallows, rack, stake or other instrument of death, praying for him, and beseeching him to recant and reform.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The. ideal condition, and the condition that Jesus Christ hks giien us as a model to go by, is a free church, <sup>e</sup> a church^ree to make known the whole counsel of God, and not an ab.-vlutely free state, but a .-tate that stands by the church and enforces her ordinances.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The founders of America,” said- Priest John J. Burke, Congregation of the Sacred Heart, recently at Utica, New York, &quot;planned courageously, hopefully, few a nation that would grant to men personal, political, religious and industrial liberty. The settlers on the shores of the Chesapeake had first given to the world the political gospel of religious toleration. America means the devotion of the individual to the [Papal Empire] standards of religious liberation, of political . freedom [under the priests], of industrial liberty. We can live together in justice and peace, and we can live together under [Papal Empire] authority and in ‘liberty’.&quot; (Brackets ours) ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The original charter of the Maryland colony was granted by Protestant England only on condition that it contained the religious-liberty clause; otherwise it would not have been given. This is not mentioned in Rev. Burke’s address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The trick of logic by which deception is planned is that of an incomplete premise; the reasoning based upon it is usually so faultless, or even brilliant, as to carry the hearer away. For example Father Burke bases his argument on liberty, on the existence of the admirable religious-liberty clause in the charter granted Lord Baltimore, but omits the all-important fact of the forcing of the clause upon the Papal Empire colonists to prevent religious intolerance. In few papal utterances seemingly in favor of liberty—or kindred popular subjects— are all the facts given to start with, and the flawless argument ensuing either misleads the hearer or produces in him a mental perplexity which he cannot understand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No papal argument should be accepted at par value without a careful search for something</span></p>

Part of the training of such writers and speakers is to first prove that a thing is right, giving every reason; and next, to prove that it and all the reasons are wrong.

In 1564 Pope Pius IV, zealous to execute the decree of the Council, issued an edict, from which the following are ■ excerpts, which was designed to help “make the world Catholic” again, by control of thought (brackets ours) :</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">S</span><span class="font12">UCH bills have as yet failed of enactment into laws, but evidently Archbishop—now Cardinal—Dennis J. Dougherty’s “Department of Laws and Legislation”, of the National Catholic “'Welfare” Council—backed by the Knights of Columbus—has not been idling away its time. Concerning the lobby maintained at Washington by the Council and sub-organizations, and its busy offices, for the purpose of •making America Catholic”, the following shop talk from the Council’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font12"> is illuminating as to tire effort being put forth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• ■ -“The Laws and Legislation Department is keeping in constant touch with the several departments of the Government in order that Catholic [Empire] interests shallie properly safeguarded. Successful results have been thus far accomplished through the intimate contact of the Laws and Legislation Bureau with the Government in several imp.prtant matter-.....The</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Department has been in.-trnnumta! in c mbatting the proposals y to Rationalize [thiough tin* Smith-Towner Bill] the edncihioual systems of th&lt;- country. and has thus far T&amp;en successful in its opjiosition to proposed adverse Americanization legislation. The Department was also prepared to aid in opposing the proposed amendment [to improve the public schools] to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Michigan Constitution. . . .When the Laws and-Legislation Department becomes thoroughly organized, the Welfare Council will have direct contact not only with the National Government but with every State legislature in the Nation, so as to be able to inform the Catholic [Empire] body concerning legislation that is either favorable or inimical to its interests. When it be.omes generally known that the Catholics [Empire subjects] of the country have such a Department in Washington, it is believed that much misunderstanding will be eradicated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Papal Empire adherents number the small minority of lfi.7 perceut of the population of the United States. A prominent Catholic authority states that the chief danger to the country conics from’ “small but active minorities&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1528 v. bat afterward developed into modern liberty was in danger of extinction through a proposition made by the Papal Empire that the teaching of Protestantism should thereafter be restricted to the territory it was already taught in and that in other regions only the “well-recognized” papal religion might be taught. A bold stand by the Protestant governments stopped this restriction, which would have destroyed the new movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1921 a like proposition embodied in a bill was passed in New York State. It restricted the free exercise of the constitutional right to the teaching of religion, to classes of “well-recognized” denominations. What constituted-, &quot;well recognized” was not defined in the bill. This omission makes it possible to bring about public prosecutions of religious teachers of every kind until they become “well-recognized” or until their classes are broken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another New York State bill provided for a state bureau of secret police, responsible only to the Governor and making possible an uncontrolled inquisition into opinion, after the manner of the Russian secret police or the Papal Empire “inquisitor of heretical depravity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A further bill provided an inquisition compelling tests of &quot;loyalty” to be applied to all teachers of every kind in the state, without defining the term “loyalty”—a term which during the war was utilized to cover a multitude of sins. Failure to meet the conceptions of loyalty, religious or otherwise, of papal agents in public positions, could conceivably bring judicial penalties upon persons guilty of nothing more than differing from the majority in re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ligious matters. If the Quaker movement were not &quot;well-recognized” what chance would a Quaker with his conscientious objections have against the penalties of such laws </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Every liberal element in the state was up in arms against these bills—which with characteristic Jesuit cunning had been slipped through the Legislature at the last moment without due opportunity for discussion. As these laws represent progress in the direction of “reasonable” liberty, no objections were heard from those that have at heart the grand movement for &quot;making </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Arn</span><span class="font12">ericn Catholic&quot;.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>77ie </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Empire and the Courts</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N THE United States the final law-making power is the Supreme Court at Washington. Any court is a law-making body, because its decisions are taken as precedents of weight. As precedents are innumerable, and on any side of any question the personal bias of the court, whether engendered by environment, beliefs, or the spirit of the hour, cannot but influence the kind of precedent selected out of the variety to choose from. It is humanly impossible for any judge, however conscientious, not to act in this manner consciously or unconsciously. Hence courts in different jurisdictions decide in an opposite manner upon the same question, until the decision of some court, higher than they, hands down a precedent governing </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font12">lower courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some control of the tendencies of the courts is possible through the existence of judges holding certain beliefs, economic, political, or religious. A judge of a Wall Street environment and one of a rural, labor, socialist, or like environment could not be expected to select identically the same precedents for their decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thus over a period of time the law drifts in a given direction, in favor of some classes and against others. Reactionary judges decide one way, and liberty-loving and progressive judges another way. On the existing bench of the Supreme Court of the United States are two judges of undoubted liberal views — Justices Holmes and^BrsJndeis. Of the seven others some are quite reactionary. Justice McReynolds is reactionary and more than once has left the court room when a minority decision was being read by the progressive Justice Brandeis. Jus</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The possible grasp of the hierarchy upon the minds of high officials of the United States is suggested in this story by Bishop John P. Carroll, of Helena, Montana: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is related of Chief Justice Taney, of the United States Supreme Court, that while awaiting his tun to go to confession one Saturday night in the Cathedral of Baltimore, a laboring man about to enter the confessional came down and said: ‘Taka my place. It ia not becoming that the Chief Justice should bo kept --waiting so long? Mr. Taney replied, T am not Chief Justice here. I am only a criminal at the bar.’ Before her altar king and peasant, governor and governed, learned and ignorant, white and black—all are equal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a number of decisions* since the beginning of the war the drift has been perceptibly reactionary. In one of the most recent ones where the issue was the right of the Postmaster General to refuse second-class rates at will to any journal and thereby destroy the publication, the • Supreme Court struck a Now at liberty of the -press by affirming this right There had been several directly opposite opinions rendered by this court but in this instance an almost for- &lt;&nbsp;gotten regulation buried in an old law was dug up and utilised to support a decision which gives a reactionary Postmaster General power to destroy half the newspapers, or indeed aH </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font12"> them, if so minded, with only a belated redress in some court of law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">According to Justice Brandsis in his minority opinion, the decision oonoerning the Postmaster General violated Constitutional Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8. He added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Tfce Postmaster General conceded that it [a recant war law] did not confer the vague and absolute authority practically to deny circulation to any publication which in his opinion is likely to violate in the future any postal law. The grant of that power ia construed into a poat'2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rate statute passed forty years ago, whioh has neve.-before been suspected to containing such implications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">... If under the Constitution administrative officers may as a mere incident of the peace-time administration of their departments be vested with the power to issue such orders as this, there is little substance in our bill of rights, and in every extension of governmental functions lurks a new danger to civil liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If there were an Empire agent as assistant Postmaster General—the official making recommendations of this kind — and a reactionary ' Postmaster General, the possibilities which the Empire sought to reach in 152S, through the</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Catholic news service, but a general news service that would be clean and healthy. “I believe,” continued he, &quot;That if St. Paul himself lived in “'our day, he would have presses running in every part of the world, turning out Catholic newspapers and Catholic literature of all kinds.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“If the Catholics of America,” continues the editor just quoted, &quot;had raised $.5,000,000 and invested it in five newspapers, these papers would now be worth $5,000,000 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">each. . . </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">.

<p><span class="font12">The liberties of the people are not particularly affected by the Catholic press, which serves to keep up the spirit of the few faithful that subscribe. But the key positions on hundreds of secular publications — editors, city editors*. reporters, superintendents and managers—are occupied by Papal Empire agents. These men make it their business to see that as little as possible is admitted to the columns reflecting on the “system”, ami as much as expedient reflecting on any opposition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">It was the seditious activities of the Jesuits about three hundred years ago that caused the Japanese Emperor to drive them out on fortyeight hours' notice, and to close the Empire to “Christianity” until the the middle of the last century. Like action was taken by the Chinese Emperor who drove them out, but carefully protected them while they were making their exit. Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order in 1773, but Pope Pius revived it again in 1814.

<p><span class="font12">HE Catholic prelate is always a patriot,” exclaims </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font12"> one of the journals published for public consumption by the Papal Empire. “The Cardinal was only a type of the average Catholic Prelate, in whose heart love of country holds a place only second to the love of God [the Pope], and who. proclaims that [that brand of] patriotism is enjoined by religion itself.&quot;—[Bracket ours]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the World War no class in the United States was so obviously patriotic as the agents of the Papal Empire. They were vehemently patriotic; they exuded patriotism. There can ba not the slightest question that they supported the government,' that they were at the elbow of every governmental official with the helping hand, to the extent of organizing a duplicate auxiliary government — the hierarchy working under the trade-name of The National Catholio War Council, with departments and divisions named after the departments and bureaus of the government, manned and equipped to &quot;assist&quot; in every possible direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The words and professions of the bishops, archbishops and cardinals — and of the profiteers — volubly demonstrate that they were patriotic. Hear Jesuit Siedenburg, Dean of Loyola University, expound Papal - Empire patriotism in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The-Open Mind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The church holds aloft the principles of patriotism for which men ore willing to live or die for country.... On account of these principles she gives her blessing to a devastating war.... At home [both in the United States and Germany] she prays for victory and for honorable peace; she upholds the hands of our President [Wilson and Empirism] and his counselors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cardinal Gibbons prayed: “Let us pray that divine assistance guide, direct, mold and fashion the actions of the President of the United States”. At the same time the direct opposite was being prayed for by Cardinals Bertram, Fruhwirt, and Piffl respectively of Breslau and Munich, Germany, and Vienna. Austria, to say nothing of Skrbensky, of Olmuty, Austria. The majority prayer favored the winners, with only five Teuton cardinals against an array of fortyeight' Allied cardinals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Much farther goes Jesuit Joseph A. Mulry, President of Fordham University, New York city, for he explains that because “the powers that be are ordained of GqJ”, what they may say is the voice of God: “The sublime Declaration of Independence [drawn up in large part by Jefferson on principles enunciated by Paine, Voltaire and other enemies of the Papal Empire] . . . means God. . . . The very coin on which we engrave, the motto, Tn God we trust’ [now withdrawn from many of them] means God. Every message of our Presidents means God.” That was while Wilson was President; now there is as President a thirty-second-degree Mason, Warren G. Harding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cardinal O’Connell, of Boston, is outspokenly patriotic: “We must obey society and its laws. ... We must obey God [Pope Benedict XV], the Master of our lives and liberties, and the laws of the State, our constituted authority.... Tin; bulwark of this country against the forces of treason is the Catholic Church.” The newspapers resound with the patriotism of Papal Empire agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why then did Thomas F. Ryan, declare, “If the Irish in this country had been worth a----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">they 'Vould have gone down to Washington and told the Englishman in the presidential chair that not an Irishman would fight until Ireland was liberated&quot; .’ Why say this bravely on April 5, 1921, instead of two or three years before, when it would not have been so easy to stand up for the real ideas of the Empire?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">HAT devoted officials of the Empire cannot possess the sentiment of true patriotism is obvious from their innumerable utterances against republics, and modern liberty, and their exaltation of the Empire above the nation. If they ch'ance to be patriotic for a particular government, it is because it serves the purpose of the Empire temporarily to favor that government. As Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes, of New York, puts it [brackets ours] :“The canonization of Joan of Arc as a saint is an event of far reaching value in this that-it emphasizes love of country, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">based on love of God</span><span class="font12"> [the Pope]”. If the Pope says “Be patriotic”, his official is patriotic; if he says, “Be unpatriotic”, the vassal of the Empire is unpatriotic. This “reasonable” patriotism is in strict harmony with the doctrine of “reasonable” liberty. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In his address to Pope Benedict XV, on the occasion of the visit of several hundred Knights of Columbus to Home, Supreme Knight Flaherty told His Holiness that it was </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">possible</span><span class="font12"> for Empire subjects to be patriotic: “During the war, the Knights of Columbus showed that loyalty to Catholic [Papal Empire] ideals </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">is not incompatible</span><span class="font12"> with devotion to country”. However, as suggested in the National Catholic Welfare Council </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font12"> this .is feasible only for a country already or soon to be subjected to the Empire:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Rev. I). S. Phelan, priest and editor of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman,</span><span class="font12"> brings out clearly the devotee’s attitude toward, first the Papal Empire ■and last and least the national governments:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Catholics of the world love the Church more than they do their own governments, more than they do their own nations. . . . We of the Catholic Church are ready to go to the death for the Church. . . . Tell us that we think more of the Church than we do of the United States; of course we do. Tell us we are Catholics first and Americans or Englishmen after-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. wards; of course we are. Tell us in the conflict between</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the Church and the civil government, we take the side</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Church; of course we do. Why, if the Govem-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ment of the United States were at war with the Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Papal Empire], we would say tomorrow: ‘Tp hell with</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the Government of the United States’; and if the church and all the governments of the world were at war, we . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would say: ‘To hell with all the governments of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' afterward. There is no doubt about it.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By no stretch of imagination can such agents <sup>1</sup> of the Empire be called patriotic. It is to be clearly understood, however, that this is not the mental attitude of the average Roman- Catholic church member who is loyal to his country, but it is by oath the attitude of all priests, ! Jesuits, Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals, who constitute the hierarchy imposed by an Italian power upon the churches; they are the . officials of the Papal Empire, and it is this seditious position into which the hierarchy are _ striving diligently to force all church members.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">During the early stages of the Civil War, Empire subjects enlisted as freely as non-Cath-olics, and there was no reflection upon their loyalty or patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Part of the most strenuous work done by President Lincoln was in preventing other governments from officially recognizing the Confederacy, which was successfully accomplished, with one exception. As time proceeded the Confederacy was recognized by the Vatican, the Papal Empire. As cited in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Neiv Age, </span><span class="font12">a Masonic organ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“In a' letter to his ‘dear son, Jefferson Davis,’ recognizing the Confederacy, the Pope branded- Air. Lincoln as a tyrant and usurper in endeavoring to destroy the Confederacy. After the reception of this letter, statistics tell us at least ninety percent of the deserters fromthg Union Armies were Romanists. This letter and attitude of Rome, we Protestants believe, was the main inspiration of the Romanist cabal in Washington, D. C., that culminated in the murder of President Lincoln, one of the noblest characters that ever graced our sinful yworlfl. Every intelligent Romanist knows that Mr. Lincoln was not the only President of the United States murdered by a Romanist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The men that plotted to assassinate Lincoln’s entire Cabinet were Empire agents, as were the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">t</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">assassins of McKinley, and Garfield, and the man that shot Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The statistics of Civil War desertions, estimated carefully, and published in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font12"> of August 30, 1891, and the Boston </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Globe, </span><span class="font12">September 27, 1891, are: Americans, 75.48 percent of the enlistments and 5 percent of the desertions; Irish Catholics, respectively 7.14 percent of the enlistments and 72 percent of the desertions; all other nationalities 17.38 percent of the enlistments, 23 percent of the desertions. This sudden change in loyalty of unsuspecting Papal Empire subjects manifests in a clear-cut&quot; manner that their patriotism is toward the Empire, which directs it toward this government or that at its will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a Rome despatch in the Chicago </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune, ‘ </span><span class="font12">November 18, 1920, discussing the “fear” of Pope Benedict of war between America and Japan, it was brought.out that faithful Romanist Venezuela had become an ally of Japan, and closed with the significant suggestion, contrasting papalized Venezuela- with Protestant America: “There can be no doubt where the influence and moral support of the Holy </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">See </span><span class="font12">will be in the event of hostilities. The Vatican-, support will go to the nation or nations in which Catholic faith is strongest”—in other words, with Venezuela and her Asiatic ally, and against the United States. Where in such an event would “the faithful” take their stand in an America not yet made Catholic!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ambassador Harvey in London tries to tell a phase of the truth about the war, and is immediately and vociferously denounced wherever Papal-Empire newspaper men exist. In 1920 in connection with the Presidential election Editor Harvey had published the famous “Immaculate Conception” cartoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Also at London Admiral Sims says something about the Empire agents in the United States, and hears from it from every Empire editor in America. Early in 1920 Sims had written an article for the TForM’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Work,</span><span class="font12"> exposing the acts of the Papal Empire in Ireland during the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The politicians who from fear of their Empire constituencies denounced the Admiral, had failed to observe the signs of the Empire’s imminent fall. As explained editorially in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> for June 17, 1921, a paper which, too, may have had a like experience: _</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“A Washington dispatch in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> says that the politicians there who were so prompt to d.enonnee Admiral Sims for what he said about the Sinn Feiners have been hearing from their constituents and the country in general, during the last few days, and are beginning'to fear that they made a mistake—that by expressing rage against the Admiral they lost more votes that they gained and seriously decreased their own political stock in trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“These apprehensions are more than justified, and the mistake made was the one to which politicians are lamentably prone—that of listening to a noisily voluble, but minute minority, au’d forgetting the vastly greater number of people who for the most of the time are inaudible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“When this majority, as in the present instance, does find its voice, it speaks with authority, and it is speaking now with an emphasis that may well be terrifying to those who, to the extent of their ability, were fighting for the Germans, while Admiral Sims, to the extent of his, was fighting against them.'’</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">- Jesuits and of the Knights of Columbus, says of Empire agents: “They... .are loyal to whatever flag floats over them, teaching always obedience to every lawfully constituted authority”. The Papal Empire doctrine is, however, that no government is lawful unless properly subjected to the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The flag of the British Empire floats over Canada, Australia and Ireland. Were Papal Empire subjects loyal to the British flag during the World War! When the British Empire was at death grip with the Imperial German Empire in 1918, Lord Curzon ([noted Father Murphy of Killena, Ireland, as hc' ing said on April 28, ■ 1918: &quot;All Irishmen are asked by Irish hierarchy not to do anything to facilitate conscription.. If any policeman goes out to force Irishmen to join the England army and is shot down, he will be damned in hell, though he may be in a state,of grace that morning.&quot; Father Dennehy of Eyries said: “Any man who in any way assists conscription will be excomipunieated by the church, and the curse of God wifi follow him”. These words could not have been uttered “from the alter” without the approval of the bishops a^d of Cardinal Logue of Ireland; and they would have had to have the approval of the Vatican. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Empire “gets out of it” by a “diplomatic” statement; says </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Courier cCltalia</span><span class="font12"> of Rome:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Holy See always has left the episcopacy of each ■ country free to take the attitude they think best in the internal affairs of their country.. Thus, whatever Cardinal Logue may consider to deal with conscription in Ireland cannot affect the impartiality and neutrality of the Vatican in this war, and is not to be considered as a violation of the policy constantly followed by the Holy See since the war began.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Australia the Empire’s priests encouraged an anti-British attitude and, according to the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font12"> of July 29; 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In conformity with his [Premier Hughes] dedaion not to harbor in the commonwealth those of any party or faith convicted of working for the disruption of the country, Mr. Hughes is taking active measures to rout out seditionists and pro-Germans. It was pointed out by the Prime Minister that every effort made to prevent the deportation of Father Jerger was the work of men of no standing, who were appealing to the elements of disruption and disloyalty. ‘No trial by jury was merited by the' priest/ Mr. Hughes said, 'since he was convicted on evidence furnished by a fellow priest, clearly stamping him as a traitor? &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Archbishop Mannix, of Melbourne, was the chief agent of the Papal Empire in Australia during the war, and conducted himself in such a manner as to incur the marked disapproval of the British Government. In the French-Canadian Romanist part of Canada, the priests taught the same resistance to conscription, and otherwise conducted themselves seditiously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Quite obviously the &quot;Church” does not teach everywhere “obedience to every lawfully constituted authority&quot;, but hands out such statements in countries, like the United States, for the consumption of a public ignorant of Empire ways.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ou more than one occasion I have pointed out that Boman Catholics who are disposed to be loyal to the [British] Government under which they live may find themselves in an awkward position owing to the claims made on them by their Church. If they a^e devout believers in the doctrines taught them from childhood, their Church has the first claim on their allegiance, and whan the demands of Rome come in conflict with.those of the State, there can be no question as to whlCfli&quot; they ahMl obey. It follows then that the allagiano, qf a Roman Catholic to the State is at best a very (justified one. ... No one doubts . . . that there are thousands of Roman Catholics who would prefer to remain loyal and law-abiding citizens of the State, but their Church . . . has encouraged disloyalty, and the great majority of the laity have abandoned all pretence of allegiance to Great Britain. Nor is this the worst, for many Roman Catholic officials, while retaining their posts and drawing Government pay, have been playing into the hands of rebels, acting apparently on the old maxim that faith need not be kept with heretics.”—Belfast </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weekly News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">John Wesley (1703-1791), founder of Methodism, said of the desirability of Papal Empire agents in a country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“I insist that no government, not Roman Catholic, ought to tolerate men of the Catholic persuasion. I prove this by a plain argument—let him answer who can—that no Roman Catholic does or can give security for his allegiance, or his peaceable behavior. ... It is a Roman Catholic maxim, established not by private men, but by a public council, that ‘no faith is to be kept with heretics'. ... It is plain that the members of that Church can give no reasonable security to any Government for their allegiance. . . . Therefore they ought not to be tolerated by any Government, Protestant, Mohammedan, or Pagan. You may say, ‘Nay, but they will take an oath of allegiance'. True, five hundred oaths; but the maxim, ‘No faith is to be kept with heretics,' sweeps them all away as a spider's web. So that no governors that are not Roman Catholics can have any security of their allegiance. Again, those who acknowledge the spiritual power of the Pope can give no security for their allegiance to any Government; but all Roman Catholics acknowledge this.''</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font12">N OCTOBER 23, 1917, occurred the disastrous collapse of the Italian army. It was not a military defeat, but the work of the Papal Empire officials, who sought to let the army of papalized Austria through to bring about the overthrow of the hated Italian Government and the reestablishment, in the turmoil, of the temporal power of the Pope. The facts were as follows, according 'to Herbert Corey in the St. Paul Pioneer Press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It was not the result of a military defeat. It was a strike. The men of a victorious army 'downed tools’. That it coulu not have been successful without a most ocmprehenaiv* and well organized scheme of treachery, ia evident. But this treachery does not smirch the honor cf the great part of the very men who threw down their guns and deserted their posts. The treachery was 'higher up<sup>1</sup>. . . . For weeks, perhaps months, the men of the Second Army and of certain elements </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> other armies openly discussed this plan to throw down their riflea and go home, thus bringing the war to an end. . . . During this period of incubation the pro-peace traitors behind the line &quot;used every means of propaganda possible. . . . ‘Peace has already come. Do not throw away your life,’ was the cry in thousands of letters written by peasant wives to peasant soldiers. Some one [the priests] had told the women that peace had been made. They [the women] were obviously sincere. ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“There is what is called in Italy the ‘Vatican propar ganda’. . . . Some members of the Pope’s entourage are known to be pro-German. . . . There are other honest, God-fearing, selfless men who did not look beyond their parish walls. They were encouraged by propagandists to preach ‘The Holy Father's Peace*, that is, an appeal for peace which was built by propagandists on the structure of the Pope's latest peace letter. ... A ‘prayer chain' covered all Italy. 110 ‘Pope’s Peace’ were sincere men and women who only hoped to put an end to bloodshed and to call back the wanderers to their homes. But the effect on the men in the trenches was disastrous.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The day before the “strike” there was a huge distribution of forged newspapers to the men in the trenches. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Corrniere della Sera</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Gio male d'Italia</span><span class="font12"> are two of the most widely read papers in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“One morning,’’ continues Mr. Corey, “huge bundlee of newspapers came to most of the Second Army's trenches. . . . False stories blazed in them: ‘British cavalry raiding Naples and shooting down women and children in the streets’. ‘French soldiers have sacked Turin and have set fire to Genoa.’ These were two of the false stories in these forged papers; The regiments from Sicily heard that Sicilian homes were being invaded, and the regiments from Turin received the papers which told of murders in Turin. If there had been a doubt before of the success of the' ‘strike’ propaganda these forged newspapers removed it. The men were determined to go home and see for themselves. But there was no doubt before. The journalistic* forgeries only removed the last probability of resistance. . . . The night before the day on which the collapse was to have taken place, the negotiating Austrians were quietly removed from their trenches. Their places were filled with Germans, to whom general orders had been issued instructing them as to the positions to be assaulted: ‘Press on as rapidly as possible,’ these orders read. Tou will meet with no resistance.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Such things are not done in an army without treason among the officers. It was the work of Papal-Empire agents in high circles, and back of it was the Vatican.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The British and the French press and officials publicly charged tire Vatican with that disaster. One of the Papal Secretaries at the Vatican, Cardinal Gerlach, the Pope’s confidant, was charged with treasonable activities by the Italian Government, and took a swift vacation to .Switzerland. Both the English and French Governments found it necessary to send representatives to the Vatican to watch and prevent the pro-German activities there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In their “reasonable” patriotism the Roman Catholics in the United States excelled during the World War.’During the Civil War they made an opposite record, and in the 1848 war with Papal Mexico at the battle of San Pablo, says </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New Age,</span><span class="font12"> “there was a St. Patrick’s Battalion fighting stubbornly against the United States troops. They were commanded by Colonel Thomas Reilly, and the whole battalion, we are informed, was made up of deserters from the United States army.” In the Spanish-American War, when Manila surrendered, Leo X1H was sorry he had not died before the victory. In order to bolster up the claim of super-patriotism the Empire agents allege that nearly forty percent of the American troops in the Revolutionary war for independence were Irish. They were Irish, but they came from the north of Ireland, from Protestant Ulster; for the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">immi</span><span class="font12">gration from Catholic Ireland had not then begun.</span></p>

There were just as many slackers and shirkers among them as among other groups of human beings. , . . They had not even squatter rights to the land on which they settled themselves, and got themselves into innumerable legal difficulties with the crown [including the War for Independence]. ... In spite of the severity of their punishment and the espionage system with which they safeguarded the morality of the colony, in 1642 Governor Bradford himself complained against the ‘sundry notorious sins' which had broken out, complaining particularly of ‘drunkennoM and uncleanness’. . . . On the religious side they rejected not only the Established Church of England, but also the fundamental principles of religion. . . . For many years they lived without a minister.

<p><span class="font12">2 'T'HE Papal Empire by a process of infiltra-* tion of agents seeks to control every agency and institution likely to become of national importance. One of these is the American Legion, an association of ex-service men of the World War. Its first National Chaplain was a Father Kelly of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The attempt was then made to bind the Legion to the hierarchy, through the Knights of Columbus, but unsuccessfully. The Knights had left a surplus of some .$7,000,000 of the money contributed by all classes for the purpose of alleviating the hardships and sufferings of. American soldiers. A surplus sum. under like conditions, the Young Men's Christian Association turned promptly back to be used for soldier relief. The Knights conceived the scheme of currying favor with and controlling the American Legion, not by giving the $7,000000 back where needy or sick soldiers would benefit by it, but by offering to huild in Washington a $5,000,000 •■.Memorial&quot; building to American Soldiers. The string in the un-American-, proposition was that the building committee should consist of three American Legion . committeemen, one committeeman appointed by the Secretary of War, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">three by the Knights ’ of Columbus,</span><span class="font12"> thus putting the balance of power of control tjf tlje Legion in perpetuity in the hands, of the Phpal Empire via the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kni</span><span class="font12">ghts and the American Hierarchy. The offer was very properly rejected by the American ijegion, which evidently prefers to render undivided allegiance to the government of the United States, instead of most of it to the Papal Empire and whatever is left to Uncle Sam.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Jesuit Influence on Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12">CCORDING- to a prominent educator eighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- percent of what is taught in the colleges, is worthless. The situation is somewhat better in the high schools and in the grammar schools, whose curriculum is, however, quite unsatisfactory. Where did this general educational in- . efficiency originate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Painter’s '“History of Education”, it is stated that the Lutheran Reformation brought into being a system of Protestant schools of an exceedingly practical character to which the people were increasingly sending their children; for the schools not merely imparted information but developed judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To offset this the Jesuits inaugurated a system of “Jesujt schools”, which aided by propaganda leaped into popularity. The subjects taught, however, related to antiquity, such as Latin-and Greek, were not particularly practical, developed the spirit of pride and emulation as against that of efficiency and workmanship, lacked intrinsic value, or tickled the vanity of pupils and parents with showy oratory, &quot;commencements”, and other useless oj harmful fads, and did nothing to develop good judgment</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The definite purpose was so to educate people that they would be devoid of good judgment, as far as education might have instilled it, and -be credulous, gullible, easily led hither and thither, and in general moulded into pliable subjects of, and contributors' to, the Papal Empire, Big Business and the politicians. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The entire world is endangered from the in-, sidious work of the Jesuit mis-educators; for it is from these Jesuitical characteristics that education suffers everywhere on the basic principle of the &quot;church” that it is better for the people to be ignorant in this life than to think a little for themselves here and be damned hereaC’er.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Battle in the Schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">P</span><span class="font12">R I JI AR IL Y the battle-ground for and against freedom is in the mind — in the mind of the child; for as the child is taught or mistaught, the nation will be. It is in the nursery and the school room that the future of the world is wrought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Victory has seemingly crowned the intrigue of the Papal Empire in the Jesuit plan to ruin the good judgment of young people by means of a perverted world system of education. Still further control of education is sought, up to the obliteration of any other schools, because, admits Archbishop Austin Dowling, of St. Paul:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Catholics, in proportion as they are loyal to the Faith of our Fathers, are loyal to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">owr</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [parochial] schools</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; our regret is not</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> that we have so many [parochial] schools, which cost a great deal‘of money, but that we have not more schools, whatever they may cost; for our efforts must be to provide schools for all our *• children, since </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">without our</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [parochial] </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">schools thora will be no church</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Empire].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So pressure is brought upon the faithful. The priests are warned by the Baltimore Catholic Council that “the priest who hinders, or through negligence does not encourage the building and maintenance of the [parochial] school, and does not recall the repeated admonitions of the Bishop, deserves removal from the Church--. AVe decree that hard by every church, where it doe ar not exist, a parochial school is to be erected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Parents are informed that it is a “mortal sin” to send children to public schools. The “Mission Book” of prayer giving directions for preparation for a “General Confession”, requires the parent to ask himself about his children, “Have you sent them to heretic or godless schools, to the danger of their faith?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Wherever feasible the Papal Empire gets along without schools, or as little schooling as possible. The countries where the Empire has ruled longest, as in Mexico, South America, Spain and Italy, have the maximum of illiteracy, beggary, poverty, and profit-producing superstition, and the minimum of enlightenment, prosperity and intelligence among the common people. The United States once stood at the head in literacy, until the flood of Empire immigrants reduced it to below ninety percent. Nearly eighty percent of the Mexican people were illiterate ten years ago; and owing to the commotion in which tile* country has been kept by Jesuit plotting, about eighty-five percent are illiterate now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Roman Catholic education, after hundreds of years of opportunity, left the English barons who signed the Magna Charta so illiterate that most of them had to make their marks in signing the paper, because the Papal Empire had not taught them to write. The common people were in a pitiable condition of ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The priests held tightly to the monopoly of education which gave them the “privilege of clergy”, under which even if a priest committed a crime, the little learning that was in his head made him so valuable that he was exempt from punishment—very likely the extraterritoriality of the Canon Law helped</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">; at any</span><span class="font12"> rata it was the rarest exception for a priest to bo punished at all or adequately by his bishop, and the viciousness and corruption of the special-privileged clergy cried to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In poor Poland—faithful child of the Empire —according to Paul Scott Mowrer in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Globe, “one</span><span class="font12"> of the greatest burdens which Poland has to bear is the legacy left by Russian and [papal] Austrian rule. In Posnania, where the [Protestant] Germans held sway, there is practically no illiteracy, but in Galicia 40 percent, and in former Russian Poland 60 percent of the inhabitants can neither read nor write. Obviously, true democracy under such conditions, is impossible,” is the damaging admission to close with. The only creditable thing there for the Papal Empire is that in education the autocratic Russian Empire of the Czara, the worst in modern history, was worse than it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Spain, says the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The campaign for improvement in the education of women in Spain, in order that they may exercise theix proper influence in the social struggle now in progress, has been taken up by Francisco. Bergamin, former Minister of Instruction, who in the course of an address in Madrid, declared that he must confess that neither the rich nor the poor women of Spain had opportunity to acquire adequate instruction. He argued that the present system has resulted in women being virtually useless in domestic life. Among the laboring folk they are ignorant of ordinary hygienic principles. The laok of comfort brought about through the want of knowledge has led people to seek salvation in terrorism and anarchy which could easily be avoided by the emancipation of women.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Papal Empire is hard put to — if it educates people, they graduate into infidelity or Protestantism; if not, they take to anarchy; either way, they have little use for the Empire of Darkness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_____________ ..</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Empire Schools in Canada</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N CANADA, says a writer in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Science Monitor; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘&quot;There can. be little doubt amongst those who have’ given the matter any study, that the chief obstacle in the way of educational progress in the [Papal Empire] Province of Quebec is the Education Act of 1841. Under this act, which ia a part of the Constitution of Canada, everything, apparently, that could be done to emphasise the cleavage of religion and race in the Province has been done. The prevailing system is one of separate schools, divided on strictly religious and racial lines, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> the duplication is carried out even where the question of language does not exist, as in the case of the Irish Boman Catholics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In an extensive study of “National Problems” by the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences the gravest problem which Canada has to deal with is that created by Papal Empire agents in the Province of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The idea of the parochial school is all wrong,” says </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New Age,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “It separates children into religious groups, footers dislike and enmity and destroys the very taproots of democracy. The effort should be made to get together in every way possible to promote good citizenship.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It might be suggested: Why not have also in each community “hard by each church”, a Meth- odist school, a Baptist school, a Christian . school, a Quaker school, a Presbyterian school, a Mormon school, a Lutheran school, and an aristocratic Episcopalian school—if the Romanist parochial school is such a good idea—each teaching its little narrowness and finally getting the entire population split up into hostile factions! Give Ireland good public schools for twenty years, and there would never more be an Irish question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In certain localities the parochial school crowds out the public school. This constitutes an educational problem in Quebec. In Jefferson, South Dakota, the Empire parochial school added a full high-school course, and forthwith all but a handful abandoned the public high school,,.which found it inadvisable to keep on with a full corps of teachers, but continued with one member of the faculty. In a certain Kansas locality the parochial school reigns supreme, having crowded out the public institutions;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">* this was the place where the mobbing of prominent Nonpartisan League lecturers took place, the Papal Empire having gone on record as opposed to such democratic organizations. The mob which tried to destroy the Union Club building on Fifth Avenue, New York, was made up largely of products of the parochial school. In France in twenty-three of the ninety French Departments, 813 primary public schools are attended by only one-tenth of the children of school age, while the same number of parochial schools have a total attendance of 95 percent of the entire school population of the villages. The minister of education questioned whether he should not order the closing or the regrouping of many public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Costly Schools &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;DAROCHIAL schools cost the members of the dioceses a substantial figure a year per pupiL American parochial schools as a whole cost $36,000,000 and serve 1,600,000 pupils at $22.50 per capita; in Indiana $1,000,000 for 30,000 pupils at $33.33; in Chicago $2,000,000 for 90,000 pupils at $22.22 per capita; and great is the grumbling of the laity as the cost rises of the education they pay for to please Empire agents. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font12">erican public schools in 1918 cost $763,678,089, served 20,853,516 pupils at $36.63 per capita, and supplied a far better education.., To help out the Empire’s schools the effort is made to draw upon public funds raised by taxation, on the argument that the parochial school saves the public school a certain amount of expense. Americans would rather pay more and have all the people properly taught. In Syracuse it was found that the religious schools got their coal and part of the Sisters’—teachers —salaries paid from public funds, under a Romanist superintendent of schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Last November the Georgia State Convention of the Southern Baptists passed the following resolution: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“We view with grave alarm the disposition of the • Roman Catholic Church to tax us through the state with the support of its institutions; we especially oppose being compelled as taxpayers to maintain parish schools, which are and should be purely private institutions; and we protest against the attempts in various sections of the country to prevent freedom of speech by mob violence, to curtail the freedom of the mails, and to close the press against the discussion of these questions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Fess bill in Congress provided that in the distribution of funds for playgrounds, athletic fields, gymnasiums and equipment, private and parochial schools were to share with the public schools. In New York City money for</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">charitable institutions went 2.7 percent to Protestant Episcopal plants, 8.2 percent to Jewish, 47.8 percent to Papal Empire institutions and only 44.8 percent to public institutions'. In a recent Pennsylvania State appropriation for “charity” 6 Jewish institutions got $284,000.00, 13 Protestant institutions $232,000.00, and 43 Papal Empire institutions $1,560,689.20. Not one of them should have had a cent of public money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- ■ To put a permanent check upon depredations by religious institutions upon public funds the following Federal Constitutional Amendment is proposed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Neither Congress nor any State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use the property or credit , of the United States, or of any State, or any money raised by taxation, or authorized either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding by appropriation, payment for the services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;'^Needless to say, the National Catholic ‘•'Welfare” Council would fight such a proposition, as it successfully fought the Smith-Towner Bill and the School Amendment to the Michigan State Constitution. The Smith-Towner Bill would appropriate $100,000,000 for various uses of public schools in states which enforce publicschool attendance, conduct all instruction in English, and allow no money for parochial or private schools; without interference of the Federal Department of Education with Cabinet officer to be created, it- is intended to prove a kind of “big brother” to states which for one reason or other have been backward in education. It is a broad, public-spirited measure, receiving the support of most of the non-Catho-lic five-sixths of the people, and will doubtless be passed in the near future, when the poli-ticiansSn Congress realize that Papal Empire threats are more bark than bite, and that there is a determined and overwhelming majority insisting on the abolition of minority control of American ^affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“United^ action” was taken by the papal sixth of the population, which by an avalanche of communications and of “influence” stopped the passage of the Smith-Towner bill under Wilson early in 1921. In the confidential letter dated</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">January 19, 1921, from the National Catholic &quot;Welfare&quot; Council to the priests the following directions were given: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Dear Reverend Bather: To appeal to you for aid in unifying Catholic protest against the Smith-Towner bill is obviously unnecessary. . . z You are doubtless familiar with the efforts we have made daring the peat two years to accomplish the defeat </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> the bill. Both of our major political parties in National Convention withdrew all promise of support to this measure, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">which we deem fatal to the best interests of American</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Papal Empire] education. We are communicating with our five thousand societies of Catholic men to urge that they be prepared for action; that they be prepared upon notice from us to wire their Congressman as societies and to have individual members and friendl of members, non-Catholic as well as Catholic, also wire protests to their political representatives in Washing<sup>1</sup>-ton. We earnestly request that you bring our statement to the attention of influential persona, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">especially nan-Catholics,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> that they may be ready to send protests to their Congressmen. We request that no protest be sent either from yourself of your friends until you receive deflnite word from us. The effectiveness of a protest is its opportuneness. We will let you know by telegraph or letter. Such protest, whether from yourself or others, should be based on the dangers which the Smith-Towner Bill involves for public education [really for Umpire education]; the heavy, unwarranted increase which it will mean in public taxes, and the-unjust and unequal distribution of those taxes. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No referenoe should'be made to the damjer which it holds for ew Catholic</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Empire] </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">schools or for any other specifically religious interest.... </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We trust that in all oases, as in this, you will work with us to the end that our laymen may be one, as our church [Empire] is one; that with one mind, as with one heart, we may light the fight for country and for Church [Papal Empire] against all the forces of evil [real liberty] that openly, or insiduously, would subvert the best interests of man [RomanisnS].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, the'bill was to be opposed </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font12">“patriotic” grounds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">VEN in Ireland the tide is turning toward the public school. There the Pope himself is solicitous about his usurped “right” to control education; in a letter to Cardinal Lj^gue, of Armagh, it was not confidence but anxiety that was manifest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“What you write regarding the condition of things in which your country at present finds itself, causes us, as is right, the greatest solicitude, more specially what you intimate—that a law is proposed which, were it to be sanctioned, would destroy the inviolable </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Church [Papal Empire] and parents in the education</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of youth. We pray that God may avert from Ireland meh a calamity. Do you, however, continue with your clergy, to defend Catholic [Empire] interests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It being held by Pius IX in the &quot;Syllabus of Errors’* that it is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">mortal error for “popular schools open to children of all classes . • . </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font12">freed from all ecclesiastical authority, government and interference . . . and to be fully subject to the civil and political power,” the “clergy” misrepresent the facts and say that “the public schools are nurseries of vice; they ■ are Godless, and unless suppressed, will prove the damnation of this country [Empire]&quot;’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Monsignor Capel predicts that “the day is not far distant when Catholics at the order of the Pope will refuse to pay the school tax, and will send bullets into the breasts -f the officials who attempt to collect them”. Strong language! Russians have been deported as undesirable aliens for less than this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Being unable yet to prevent public schools or destroy them, the agents of the Papal Empire endeavor to control them. Empire agents are planted on school boards. Insufficient building accommodations are provided. Graft prevails unceasingly in school expenditures. Funds are diverted to private religious schools. Public school teachers are kept down in pay to a day laborers wage, and the best ones are driven out of a profession that, for its public utility, ought to be the best paid. Extraordinary demands are made upon the teachers’ time, requiring day and night and all--unimer work. Inquisitions are inaugurated into their private opinions, such as the recent so-called Lusk “loyalty” laws in New York, something not demanded of any other class of public employes. Wage increases are refused until non-Catholic teachers leave the schools, and Empire instructors take their place, when salaries, are raised. Religious instruction is barred, including the reading of the Bible, and a secular condition is created as a basis on which to denounce the schooK. as godless. It is needless to say that delinquency prevails in a not less degree among parochial school pupils than in the public schools, but the hitter are painted as &quot;nurseries of vice and erinic &quot;.

<h6><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>Empire Progressiveness</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12">N IMMENSE amount of welfare work is in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- progress or planned by Papal Empire agents at the expense of the laity, who complain of the mounting cost of hierarchy schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work in cities may be. illustrated by that in Toledo under Bishop Joseph Schreinbs. The . annual report of the National Catholic Community House covers a wide range of activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work is modeled on much the same lines</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font12">that of the Young Women’s Christian Association, and originally found its inspiration in that Association's success in attracting Catholic girls and young women. A like work is conducted in many cities for boys and young men —obviously the fruitage of the success of the Y. M. C. A. in drawing Catholic boys outside of Church influences. The Catholic welfare institutions bear popular names, such as “Everyman’s Club” in Portland, Oregon, “Workingmen’s Club” in Denver, “Everybody’s Club” in 'Seattle, “Workman’s Club” in Salt Lake City, possibly as a mild camouflage of the religious character of the institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Such work is under the general guidance of the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare Council, which is the Empire Hierarchy under another name. There is no question that it is good work. If the motives were purely religious or moral it would not be open to question in the slightest; it is of interest in this connection purely because such endeavors and the genuine religious zeal of the church membership are utilized to strengthen the hold 7hich the Papal Empire can get upon the people. As usual, the difficulty is not with the common people, but in the ambitious ecclesiastics who seek a pernicious control over the minds and pocketbooks of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Social Action Department publishes a number of, on the whole, very useful textbooks, on a simple question-and-answer plan, for the instruction of the unlearned in civics, the social question, the Constitution, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another live subject taken up in a “Reconstruction Pamphlet” is “Cooperation Among Farmers and Consumers&quot;. This states the problem of the inexpensive distribution of products sold or purchased by farmers, outlines the history of cooperative efforts to bring producer and consumer closer together, and outlines detailed plans for organizing and carrying on cooperative societies by which the desired aim may be achieved. Such a program is recognized .by every farmer as desirable, as giving him a higher return, and a lower operating cost, and by consiynerp in cities and towns as lowering their living expenses. Where proper legislation is lackingVletailed for s of bills for legislatures are given, as the basi.- in law for the most successful operation of cooperative movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is a far-seeing and seemingly broad-spirited plan for assisting classes that need -such help in their problems. It is the Church lending its helping nand to the people; for the societies are to be manned by Empire agents, and of course, directed by the priests and bishops. If successful it will remove much of the distrust among the American people, which originated in the Protestant &quot;rebellion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A considerable educational work, reaching 200,000 men, is carried on by the Knights of Columbus, in night and day classes and in the supplying of courses of study in correspondence schools, business colleges, colleges and universities. Institutional activities prevail in the innumerable organizations of the laity, men and women, boys and girls. Block parties in oities are under Church auspices. Catholic hospitals in New York city treat 30,777 cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No one finds anything but good in these things. But the proper work of the Catholic churches, as churches, is made the basis of, and is exploited by a hierarchy for, illegitimate ends connected with the superimposing upon all the people of the world of a government which will exact and enforce obedience in religious, political, business and home affairs to me minutest detail. This is objected to not merely by the . billion and a quarter non-Catholic people of the world, but by </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">considerable proportion of the Catholic membership, who perceive the proper limitations of church and state, and do not </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ap</span><span class="font12">prove of encroachments either way.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>The Empire and Labor</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N CONNECTION with the labor movement the autocratic Papal Empire long took no interest in the aspirations of working people to better their condition, but rather sought to make them contented with their earthly lot, with the better hope of something worth while, after at least a thousand years in the fires of Purgatory. Some three decades ago the Empire officially banned the Knights of Labor; bnt when Catholic workmen insisted that they were going in, church or no church, the Empire shifted its position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of late years the labor movement has been coming to the front, and in many nations is in power, or nearly so; and the Empire knows that it has to agree with the new movement, or go under. So Empire agents are vociferous in their endorsement of the aims of labor.</span></p>
<div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">In the labor unions in this country so many of the leading positions are held by Human Catholics that it may be said that the Empire has control of that movement It is not surprising to hear Frank Morrison, Secretary of the American Federation of Labor, say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘&quot;The so-valled ‘open-shop’ is supported by the bench, the bar, politicians and practically all the daily newspapers, but it is significant that the greatest moral force in the country stands with labor on this question. The theory of Big Business is rejected by the Church. The representatives of the Church, regardless of creed, denounce the so-called ‘open shop’, and declare it is an attempt to crush organized labor. . . . The National Catholic Welfare Council, composed of representative bishops of that church, declare that the •open shop’ is a mask for non-uuionism. and is- not only a menace to wage-earners, but threatens the whole structure of industrial peace.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The world over, the Empire seeks to buttress its power by an appeal to working people. It pretends that it has<sup>1</sup> forsaken its still obvious alliance, with Big Business and the politicians, and with deceitful words tries to hold the common people in the fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To be consistent the Empire should exercise its power on employers of labor, such as the Catholic men prominent in the great corpora. tions, in behalf of the workers, for example, in ’ the steel business. A prominent Catholic, C. M. Schwab, of the Bethlehem Steel Company, is reported in the press as saying that the American worker must reduce his standard of living to the German level. This was before a Big Business audience, in an address to the New York Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Schwab had just returned from a visit to Rome. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the shipping business the ship workers struck for proper wages. Admiral Benson, head of the Shipping Board, which leases vessels to ship-operating companies, was favored by Pope Benedict with knighthood in a high Empire order. Admiral Benson issued a warning to 'he ship operators that*he would take all Government ships away from any operators grarttiqg the wage demands of the men. Either the hierarchy is hypocritical in its attitude toward labor and only wants to hold them in the church by that means, or it has very little influence with employers and Big Business. In either cash it hj a v&lt;ak support for the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thinking men take little stock in the utterances of eirlesiastics. and in consequence, as a European writer says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Slowly, but surely, with the irresistible movement of a geological subsidence, faith is waning among the workers, and even among the peasants. -One may gafaly assert that about twenty years ago nearly every One held to some creed. Freethinkers were few and to-=,be found only in the middle class. Today the workmen who follow no particular creed number millions, and as their hopes of a heavenly kingdom dissolve, other hopes assert themselves.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thus the hand of the Papal Empire grown palsied and there slips from its grasp the power it seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The purpose back of the welfare, labor and farmer work of the Empire is this: They hay® seen the popularity and efficacy of welfare work, as started and conducted by non-Catholics. They paid no attention to it until the membership began to slip. Now they have taken it up as a propaganda agency to promote the popularity and advance the interests of the system, religious and political. In time they will be found backing a variety of welfare and labor laws, with the expectation that a grateful populace will occasionally vote for laws in the interests of Empire political ends. “You scratch my baric, and Til scratch yours.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' '</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Empire and Immigrant</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE immigrant has suddenly become the object of solicitous attention by the Empire. In Italy and other ports of embarkation the dreaded Methodists are meddling with the principal source of supplies for the American hierarchy. When the emigrants assemble at European ports a Methodist spy gives them some little comforts, and a few pieces of literature in the emigrant’s own language, telling him some of the facts about Protestantism in America, the liberty of religion, etc. Without “faithful” immigrants the American princedoms -of the Empire will languish, for it is hard enough now to keep the newcomers lined up as good payers, and their children and grandchildren become hopeless cases after contact with American youngsters and the public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As says the National Catholic [Empire] War Council </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font12"> &quot;The immigrant problem is one, of the most important confronting the United States; it is one that affects not only the country, but </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the yeuered interests of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">church</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Empirel rts </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ucll.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Social Action Department's preliminary study indicates the necessity of having a national Catholic organization, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">recognized</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> by the Immigration Bureau of the Department of Labor, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">coOperating</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> with it, to handle this problem from the standpoint of the national [Empire] interests connected with it. ... A Catholic organization, which would help the new arrivals at ports of entry, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">keep them out of the hands of proselytizers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">[Protestants] and exploiters, guide them to their destination, give them a fair picture of American opportunity and [&quot;reasonable”] democracy, even accompany the trainloads that go West from the ports, and in every way try to welcome and inspire the new arrivals, would be of vast benefit to the immigrant, to the country, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to tHe church&quot;'</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Empire].</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When something is to be done for the Empire, such as warning immigrants against American liberty, public schools and other ideals of a free country, the Empire agents wrap themselves in the flag, assume the pose of patriotism—the “reasonable” kind—and- start “cooperating” with the United States Government. Their zeal to be “recognized” suggests the origin of the phrase “well-recognized denominations” employed during the war in draft regulations and in 1921 in the Lusk “loyalty* laws of New York State for the purpose of making trouble for humble Christians not &quot;recognized” according to the standards of the Empire agents and their un-American “Protestant&quot; sympathizers. Immigrants had been coming to this country a million strong a year, but no such patriotic zeal was manifested by the Empire until the Methodist terror began its deadly work in the Empire’s European strongholds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is no more reason why the United States Government should help the Papal Empire hold on to its subjects than why it should assist the Moravians or Mennonites. There are reasons why the Government should want the immigrant informed as to any hostile purposes against . American liberties. The soil of America furnishes a free field for all religions on an equal basis, and it is un-American for the Empire to suggest that “such an agency could direct the new arrivals to the farms and to localities </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">where their faith would not be endangered. </span><span class="font12">Connections could be established with like organizations in the European countries to protect further the interests of the immigrants” —meaning the interests of the. Empire in the immigrants. The Empire, according to the Catholic press, herds the immigrants together in colonies where “the faith” will not be endangered, the foreign language perpetuated, the people kept in parochial schools and oat of public schools and away from the real spirit of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If there is to be a “recognized” Romanist agency “coilperating” with the .United States Government, why not have more of a good thing —“recognized” agencies for the Mathodists, Bahaists, River Brethren, Latter Day Saints, Finnish Evangelical Lutherans and the Vedan-tas ! Not all of the immigrants are Empire subjects, and it is not fair to have Empire agents working on both Catholic, Protestant and pagan newcomers, without the Government giving the other churches a chance to work on the incoming Catholics.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>The Protestant “Rebellion**</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE attitude of Romanism toward Protestantism is usually imagined by Protestants to be merely that of one church toward another —the jealousy of an older and less pure church toward her younger and more attractive daughters. The matter cannot be properly understood without a knowledge of the existence of the Papal Empire as a civil power; for the Empire as supreme regards Protestantism as a rebellion, a revolt, and is strengthening itself and weakening Protestantism for the time when the rebellion may be put down by the methods whereby a government destroys sedition and rebellion in a revolting province. It is going to be an Herculean task; for the “revolt” has a membership of 167,000,000 compared with the 288, 000,000 membership of the Empire. The papaoy has just fifty percent of the Christian population of the world, the Greek church with 121,000,000 making up the difference in the total of 576,000,000. This is one of the considerations which throw light on the exaggerated selfimportance of the papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The time must not be forgotten when the Pope was civil ruler of the States of the Church in Italy and had an army of his own, which fought on actual battle fields with real gunpowder, guns, cannon, swords and bayonets, against the armies of the Italian Government, or in more ancient days fought the various enemies on which the Pope ordered his generals' to make war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ The Empire still has an army; the nucleus </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">exists </span><span class="font12">today in the so-called Swiss Guards, .which protect the Vatican from invasion, and are armed with the most modern and murderous weapons. The Pope occasionally speaks of &quot;the militia of the Pope”, and non-Catholics suppose i - it is a figure of speech; but not so, for in every i nation where the Papal Empire operates, this &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;militia is a'real thing. It is an army, with</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;various branches, including a military intelli-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">t gence service, consisting of the Jesuits, claimed ? to number many millions—twenty millions, says one Romanist writer. In the United States the Knights of Columbus, numbering about a million are in the &quot;militia of the Pope&quot;. In addition is a number of &quot;religious” orders, masquerading under a variety of cognomens, but all armed and drilled, formerly in public, but not so much ao during the recent countrywide scrutiny of i the Papal Empire and its nature, purposes and methods. In 1920 these organizations were unit</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font12">under a single head, the National Catholic &quot;Welfare” Council, and they are believed to ; number some two or three million men and scouts, who can be armed and placed in the ' field on short notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Numerous stories have been afloat for many I years about stores of arms secreted within Papal Empire institutions, some of which have been seen by non-Catholics. One of these instances was reported by an acquaintance of the writer, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">teamster assisting in unloading to the basement of a House of the Good Shepherd several hogsheads of ‘‘maple sugar”, one of which broke and proved to be full of rifles. When inquired as to the purpose of such preparations a Papal <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empire Bishop answered that they were for</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the purpose of affording the advantages of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">organization and drill to the members, but not for the use to which guns and ammunition are usually put. &quot;It is certain that the truth may be hidden when we are not obliged to tell it,” teacheslhe “Moral Theology” of &quot;Saint” Liguori.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Tlf </span><span class="font12">ETII(\DI5^T Methods of Proselytizing in Italy _$Are Exposed,” is the headline of an article in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Ilayister</span><span class="font12"> of Toronto. —<sup>J</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;The “menace” has so aroused Archbishop Vec-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">cari, of Bari, Italy, that he is going to start doing the poor Italians a little good — with American money. He blames the Methodists and the Y. M. C. A. for &quot;making philanthropy the instrument of proselytism and turning Italian Catholics- from the faith,” and has begun a couple of philanthropic institutions. Evidently &quot;doing people good” had not taken a philanthropic turn, until the advent of the Protestants. The Methodist crimes are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Methodist centre in Bari, a city on the Adriatio Sea, 150 miles from Borne, is in a large building which they recently bought for 150,000 Dre ($8,007). In tha upper stories of this building the Methodists conduct schools for boys and girls. The whole main floor ia , equipped as a club. There are pool rooms, reading rooms, smoking rooms, and other facilities for education and recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Besides conducting a school, which is attended by several hundred boys and girls, the Methodists in Bari provide meals without charge to these children and others. Coffee and bread is served in the morning, a light lunch is provided at noon, and at three ’clock the children are given bread and marmalade. Before leaving the institution in the evening they get a meal of bread and meat. They also contribute clothing for the children of the poor. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The books and tracts which the Methodists circulate among the Italian people of Bari are such aa would poison their Catholic faith. In this work of spreading their literature the Methodists have the cooperation of the Y. M. C. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“His Grace, the Archbishop, has become alarmed at the propaganda of these American secretaries, and has warned his flock against the insidious evil which has arisen, but unless the Catholics are able to give the people an equivalent or better institution, the Methodist centre is certain to do immense harm. To many of those who are very poor, and especially to those who lack proper instruction in their religion, the free food and clothing are a temptation that may succeed in alienating them from the Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the faithful in America can pay in some more money:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Rev. Vito Lattanzi, secretary to Archbishop Vaccari . &nbsp;&nbsp;. has been sent to this country [this costa</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$600 round trip first class, and has to be raised, too, by the faithfuljto collect funds for the welfare centra which His Grace intends to found in Bari. Father Lattanzi saya that the cost of the institutions which are contemplated will be about $50,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is going to cost more than $50,000, when operating expenses are figured up, including several $600 round trips to America.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Empire and Violence</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">WO great weapons in the armament of the Papal Empire are deceit and violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Government is ultimately a matter of applied force. The Crusades of the dark ages were the Empire’s authorized application of violence to the ends desired—the destruction of Albigenses and Waldenses, tens of thousands of whom were butchered; the “rescue” of the “Holy Sepulchre’’ from Moslems and Jews, of whom thousands were massacred within the walls of Jerusalem; the torture of millions by the Empire’s secret service, the Inquisition; tin- making of laws for subordinate civil governments and the turning over of tens of millions to the governments to be dealt with. The Papacy as super-government obliged the kings to make “suitable” laws for the punishment of heretics, and then turned over to the rulers persons found to be heretics; the rulers tortured them, some more and executed them as sedition-sto and law-breakers; and on this flimsy sophistry any Papal Empire “Bishop” will solemnly state » that the “church” [as a church] never killed _ anyone — and non-Catholics believe the thiu-‘ veiled lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not a little of the disorder and violence throughout the world is traceable to Papal Empire agents. The various “white terrors” in European countries are reported to be carried on by ex-service Romanists cooperating with Big Business representatives and agents of the governments. <sup>ir</sup>Wrath against reason” is the Empire policy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE. World War taught hitherto “civilized” countries the value of the lie, as a means for effecting desired ends. Governments, with-■ Out exception, deserted the plain truth and lied shamelessly to the common people, and to one another. Treaties and sworn statements became “scraps of paper”. Propaganda filled the air, the press, the atmosphere of Big Business, and the pulpit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. “The nineteenth and twentieth centuries,” explains Robert Lynd in the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the subject, “On TellingbLit'-.” &quot;have been a time of great discoveries. . . The greatest discovery of all, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• has been the latest—the discovery of how to tell a lie without so much as a prick of the conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is possible it might never have been made if it had not been for the war. Happily, during the war all countries went in for the manufacture of propaganda as an important branch of. munitions; they made their statements as they made bombs, and for the same purpose. Their object was to inflict damage on .the enemy; and every statement was judged, not according to its accuracy, but according to its effectiveness as an explosive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“It must have been in the propaganda factories, I imagine, that the secret of the perfect lie was discovered. The Ten Commandments wore suspended for the duration of the war; and statesmen learned, to their surprise, how much better they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">coul/l get</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> on without them; many thinkers from Machiavelli down to Nietzsche had already timed us to free ourselves from the base servitude of morality, hut the thing laid never been actually done before on the grand scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“During the war, however, it became jtossible to call Lord Haldane a German, a profiteer, a patriot, and Mr. F. S. Oliver, a sage. You were allowed to call the sun the moon as it passed over Berlin; and people believed you, if you said that you had seen an army corps of Russians eating ice-cream from a barrow at Charing Cross. That was the glorious thing about it—people actually believed you. That was the greatest discovery of the war, next to the uselessness of the Ten ‘ Commandments ; statesmen realized that human beings could be got to believe anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Similarly a modern statesman could find no difficulty in explaining the decapitation of King Charles I as fin outrage on the part of Cavaliers, who had discovered that the King was selling them out to Cromwell; they could even tell you the exact price. If you protested that the evidence of the complicity of Cromwell in the King’s death was overwhelming, they woidd indignantly denounce you as the friend of assassins; and again a loud cheer would show that they had won the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The lie, indeed, is triumphing today like a false religion. The Jews worshiped the golden calf; we worship the brazen ass.

Men have been sent to jail before now for telling the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">THE Papal Empire, however, has never heed-</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font12">ed instruction in the secret of “the perfect lie”. It was of this chief characteristic that St. Paul spoke prophetically: “Even him whose coming [presence] is after the working of-Satan [father of lies] with all power and signs and lying wonders; and with all deceivableness </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">unrighteousness in them that perish; </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">because </span><span class="font12">they received not the love of the truth. . . . and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.”—2 Thessalonians 2: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jesuits are taught to argue equally well on any side of a question. To them a lie is a means to an end; the better the end the better the lie. Newspaper offices are filled with Jesuit editors and reporters, who make much of the alleged “news&quot; quite unreliable. They misrepresent issues; hide the main points and argue on trifles; make false statements, and build on them a chain of reasoning; make claims that do not exist; state, as in regard to the Smith-Towner publiceducation Bill that it has certain features which it does not have, and will produce certain harmful results which it will not produce. The Vatican pursues a given course until likely to be unsuccessful; thereupon it publishes a &quot;denial” of what was a fact; the hierarchy of a country, as in Ireland, will egg the people on to violence* up to the point of inviting legal penalties, and over night reverse itself, and make the world * believe the untruth. In New York the movement to oust Socialists from the Legislature is pursued - to the point of damaging the party in Sower, when the power behind the throne with-raws, and the movement seemingly fizzles out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the Papal Empire cause has been advanced a little, and on the advanced position the Empire entrenches itself, consolidates the ground, and prepares for another advance. This is the method of procedure the world over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An officer of an anti-Empire organization is convicted in court of a vile offence, on the sworn testimony of a soldier, whose name indicates Empire persuasion. A publisher of an anti-Bmpxre journal is convicted of violating the postal laws and sent to the penitentiary, on the sworn testimony of postal inspectors, a great proportion of whom are Empire adherents. A clergyman openly opposes the Empire, is charged with immorality and debased before his associates, and publicly in the papalized press. One of the crimes which an Empire adherent may commit and be promptly absolved of by confession and absolution at the hands of an Empire agent, is perjury. &quot;One may use restrictions in taking an oath,&quot; affirms theologian “Saint&quot; Liguori;'&quot;whose writings contain nothing worthy </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">T&gt;f</span><span class="font12"> censure, and the faithful may saturate themselves in them without the least peril; the doctrines of this Saint are now the doctrines, not only of Italy, but of Europe and of the Catholic world,” confirms Pope Pius VH and the Empire hierarchy. &quot;No faith is to be kept with heretics,&quot; announces the Council of Constance. Any charge whatever made against a person opposing the Papal Empire is to be regarded with the utmost suspicion, as probably, backed up by perjury and being a mere &quot;frame-up”.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>The Empire and the “Y”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12">T^OB The Young Men’s Christian Association, after it had got along smoothly with the tiger for many years, the World War afforded an opportunity for the Papal Empire to stick the knife in to the hilt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The &quot;Y&quot; was given charge of the army commissariat, or the sale of supplies to the soldiers, and in that capacity was obliged to sell what was in its charge for that purpose. This function it faithfully carried out, and in addition -gave away millions of dollars of articles to the soldiers — more than all other organizations put together. The Knights of Columbus were also restricted in some degree in the giving of certain articles, but disregarded the restrictions measurably, and also distributed millions of dollars worth free, and created an impression that they served the soldiers free, while the “Y“ charged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Boys are influenced by what they hear talked, regardless of facts; and the slurring of the “Y* became, a habit throughout the army and the country at large. This was Papal Empire propaganda, and was attributable to the fact that the &quot;Y&quot; is a Protestant organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">John B. Mott, head of the International &quot;Y”, said during the war: &quot;In the Italian army we have placed the most dynamic literature; and... when the story of the war is written, if the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. are not on record as the identified Evangelical Church of America, then I will hand in my resignation&quot;. W. 0. Easton, Philadelphia “Y&quot; secretary confirms, with this: “Catholic boys coming to the Y. M. C. A. should do so with a full realization of the fact that the Protestant aspect of the Christian religion is not softpedaled. . . . The Y. M. C. A. stands squarely upon the Protestant faith and . . . represents the Protestant viewpoint* ____. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. - &nbsp;&nbsp;- ■—-—----------</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “Y” is obnoxiously active in Borne. It was not surprising therefore that “Pope Benedict, replying to an address by the visiting American Knights of Columbus, attacked the spreading of propaganda in Rome by an organization which he did not name. He said it aimed to deprive the youth of their birthright of Catholic [Empire] faith. The Pontiff urged the Knights to establish a counter propaganda.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Afterward his Holiness named the “Y” defi-_ nitely, ordered the American hierarchy to get ’ busy, and report in six months on results. Associate Secretary C. V. Hibbard, of New York, promptly backed water, and said: “It had been abundantly substantiated that the Y. M. C. A. is not a proselyting organization”; he could think of no reason for its being the subject of a papal attack. Associate General Secretary J~. S. Tichenor recited “delightful - cooperation” with many Roman Catholics, including Father Burke of Washington and Dr. John Neill, former Commissioner of Labor. “If the Y. M. C. A. will just quit proselytizing, the friction will cease to exist,” suggests the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catho-•<sub>f</sub>— lie Citizen.</span><span class="font12"> “The Y. M. C. A. has avoided proselyting,” says Secretary Knowles Cooper. And, says the editor of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font12"> “I have traveled, and have seen ‘Y’ activities in Peru, Chile, and Argentine, South America, and I know that the institution does try to proselytize”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“There was no general ban placed on the ‘Y’ by the Pope,” he adds. But it is different in Mexico. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">El fiestaurdor,</span><span class="font12"> a Papal Empire weekly of Mexico City &quot;censored by the ecclesiastical authorities”, and therefore “regular”, announces eternal torment for Catholic boys joining the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“News from Chihuahua informs that the Very Illustrious Jo.-1? Quzada. Vicar-Capitular [or general] of the See has issued an excommunication decree against the Catholic young men who dare to affiliate with the Y. M. C. A. organization once the decree has been published. Taking into consideration the aforesaid, we expect That many of our young men will immediately sever their connection with the Y.M.C.A. If as Catholics they cannot form part of an organization enemy to the Church [EmpireJ, as patriots they should also deny their sujsjiort to the Protestant American Arganization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There arc'phices, then, where it is “unpatriotic” to &quot;Ke in the “Y”. In Mexico the Empire does not have to camouflage its intentions. If ‘ the “Y<sup>r</sup>” is Protestant, as John R. Mott says it</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">is, the time is near when it will have to take a definite stand; for Papal Empire apologists are not likely to stay popular when the “tidal wave of anti-Catholicism” expected by Romanists, mounts to its height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N MEXICO practically all the progress that has been made in a century’s uphill and dangerous fight for liberty had been made by the Masons, who are striving to bring “Masonic Light” to that darkened country. The land of Mexico had been appropriated by the aristoo* racy and the Empire; but some improvement was made under Diaz the Mason, some was attempted under one of Mexico’s high-minded men, Madero the Mason, and now under Obregon the land is being given </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">io</span><span class="font12"> the common people against the united protests of Wall Street and the Empire. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Between the Masonic fraternity arid the Catholio Church there ii antagonism inherent in the nature of the organization; the one seeking the broadest liberty of thought, and the other striving to stifle all revolt against the self-constituted authority that would hold the mind and soul in thraldom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Masons of the Continent,” remarks the Papal </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “claim credit for the revolution in Portugal and the consequent ‘persecution’ of the Catholic Church in that country. In France, Spain and Italy the leaders of the anti-clerical parties are Masons. . . . The anniversary of the fall of Papal Power is a Masonic holiday in Italy. The unspeakable [to the Empire]Nathan was head and front of Italian Masonry, whose honor roll contains the names of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Crispi [famous Italian patriots]. ... In the past two hundred years every organized opposition to the Church [Empire] had its inception or found ite greatest support in the lodges. In that time it would be difficult to name a single prominent enemy of [papal] Christianity who was not identified with Masonry. Only one blind to the tacts of history could fail to see the malign [to th&lt;&gt; Empire] influence of Masonry at ths bottom of the conditions in Mexico and other Latin American countries.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the regular papal rites is called “the General Intention of the Apostleship of Prayer against Masonry”. And with good reason; for a tidal wave is not merely on the way, but here —as says a Masonic journal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“We have the right to summon, not only every Scottish Rite Mason, but every Protestant in religion, every true patriot and lover of his country, whether the subject</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papacy,' to resist to the uttermost the aggressiveness</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">! of the Roman Catholic Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The recent convention of the militant Masonic Clubs at Washington, does not spell a good omen for the Empire, nor the fact that Wilson-ism — Empirism — is dead, and President Warren G. Harding, as a thirty-second-degree Mason, at the parade of the convention “gave * the grand salaam in answer to that extended to him&quot;, and the shout that went up, “We love you, <sub>:</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Harding; for you are one of us!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Empire and Socialism</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">B</span><span class="font12">U T the particular bugaboo of the Papal</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Empire is the family of which Socialism is a member. A dreadful fear possesses the hierarchy and the priests, that the dark fate might overtake them that settled down upon the Russian clergy—stop their plotting and put &gt;&nbsp;them to work earning an honest living like other ' people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• What is the Empire’s official attitude toward '■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socialism! &quot;The Bishops of Holland and of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany,” Jesuit Rev. Peter Findlay tells us</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">in the Toronto </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register,</span><span class="font12"> “in joint pastoral letters, and many other Bishops — each for his own diocese — have condemned Socialism. So, too, have the last three Popes, for the Universal Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“We declare,” says Pius IX, “that all those incur, by the very fact, excommunication reserved to the</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• Roman Pontiff . . . who join sects . . . which plot either secretly or openly against the Church [Empire] i or lawful authority; as also all those who give to such j lects any assistance whatever.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">! “All Catholics,” continues Jesuit Finlay, “sin griev-, oualy .who themselves accept or propagate Marxian</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Socialism; who join an association which professes it;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">\ or enter into or remain in any society or body which u affiliated or united with a Marxian Socialist associa-bon. Catholics who join such a Socialist association, or society or body which is a unit in it, incur exconununi</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cation, with all ita spiritual consequences [hell fire,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">j roasting, broiling, devils, etc.]. The Dutch Bishops wrote advisedly: ‘The alternative is — either Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' or Socialist; but to be a Catholic and a Socialist at ■ the same time if an, impossibility. . . . Catholics sin mortally and incur excommunication, who become or remain members &quot;of the Labor Party and Trade Union Congress, which by formal resolution, has united with • the Socialist International.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Empire puts the Socialists with “the beasts that perish”; for “the Catholic Church [Empire] has the right and duty to kill heretics, because it is by fire and sward that heresy can be extirpated . . . the only recourse is to put them to death. For the highest good of the Church [Empire] is the Unity of Faith, and this cannot be preserved unless heretics are put to death.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The issue is plain between Socialism and the Empire. Both cannot exist permanently to- .. • gether. And in country after country the issue is joined and bloody conflicts mark the attempted extirpation of the Socialist “heresy&quot; at the hands of the Empire, Big Business and the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In America the Knights of Columbus have a traveling lecturer named Peter W. Collins, who puts this in to his lecture to fellow Knights: “Socialists should be so handled that in a few minutes they will be scurrying into holes and , corners to hide, or seeking hospitals to have their wounds doctored&quot;. “They that take the sword </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">shall</span><span class="font12"> perish by the sword” is perhaps one of the Master’s admonitions yet to be noticed <sup>1 </sup>by Jesuit Collins. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fight is carried into legislative bodies. On the pretext of unpatriotism Socialists are thrown out bodily from the New York Legisla-hire: and the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font12"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;There is nobody who is weak-minded enough to believe that patriotism or Americanism had anything to do with the ouster of the Socialist Assemblymen. ... Exclusion of duly elected Roman Catholic representatives could easily follow such a precedent.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">OR the Papal Empire has become the selfelected guardian of law and order, with liberty or without liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Deportation is recommended: “If the members of the ‘red’ organization don’t like this country, • let them go home. If they do not go, then we will have to send them there.”—It was Cardinal Gibbons that spoke. But, says a witty writer, “Rome opposes radicalism, and hounds the ‘reds’, but there is nothing more red than the red biretta, or the red cassock of a Cardinal • Prince of Rome”. In France Monsignor‘Montagu ini was deported as an undesirable alien, on account of his plotting against the French Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Archbishop Hayea of New York stated that “a secret dlaorganlxstlon wan going forward, threatening the fabric of American institutions”. Americans know that this is not the “reds&quot;, but that the plotting is by agents of the Papal Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nevertheless the Empire poses, as the BigBusiness </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Trail Street Journal</span><span class="font12"> puts it: &quot;It would almost seem as if the age-old consistency of the Boman Catholic Church [Empire] remained as the nation’s last barrier against Bolshevism”. ''’ The Bishop of Duluth, John T. McNicholas is sure of it: “The Church [Empire] stands as adamant against the violence, the injustice, the indescribable calamities which the destructive forces, rising from the ruins of the world, would now spread over Europe and the rest of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Italy Big Business and the Empire incited the Fascist! against the Socialists; and the carnival of burning, shooting and killing and of reprisal against reprisal that has ensued, has only aggravated the “red&quot; movement, and disconcerted those that brought it on. Incitement ,-to violence is a poor way to allay violence. &quot;Like begets like.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But as the Empire always profits from the turbulence of war, so it is profiting through the “red” menace, by its pose as the protector of law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It has been many centuries,&quot; says B. F. Kospoth, of Switzerland, “since the friendship and assistance of the Vatican have been sought so eagerly as today by the rulers of Europe. This recrudescence of power the Vatican owes to the Red menace. For it has at ite command the spiritual force without which mere material force is impotent to vanquish Lenine and his works. ... So it is no wonder that all the European statesmen, no matter how frigid their feelings may have been in the past toward the Vatican, have set out ou a pilgrimage to Rome, to beg the loan of this force in their battle against Bolshevism.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And so the “Church” links its fortunes with thos&amp;'of Big Business and the politicians, in a day when the only safety would lie in doing to the people that justice which might destroy the causes of the radical protest against intolerably conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Says the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nation,</span><span class="font12"> September 18, 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The independence </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Poland ia threatened from the West, not from the East—from Paris, not from Moscow. The Polish Government has been almost aet aside. . . .

For the Vatican is entirely in agreement with the French Government in regard to Poland, since it desires a reactionary Catholic Power to take the place of the Austrian Empire. The candidate of the Quai d’Orsay [French Big Business], the Russian dmtgrds [fugitives], and the Vatican is M. Dmoaki...... .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Dangerous to Poland and to Europe as are the imperial- . 1st ambitions of General Pilsudski, M. Dmoski would bo far worse. He is a reactionary clerical [Empire agent] and anti-Semite, who would be the tool of the Quai d’Orsay, the Vatican and the Russian Counter-revolutionaries. His policy would be one of pogroms and a White Terror [papal ex-service men in mob action] at home.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;A land of tears and sorrow” is the description of'the Quaker relief workers in Poland. The Polish government is in the hands of-adventurers, aristocrats, papal agents, and other so-called “patriots&quot;, who are responsible for the economic ruin of the country. Production in industry is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">oft</span><span class="font12"> 75 to 90 percent from the disorder caused by these men. The total income of the government is three milliards, but the salary list to pay the Papal Empire adventurers on the Government pay-roll is thirty-six milliards for 410,000 employes, “one of the most monstrous bureaucracies in Europe”. The papal-ised government, which is a typical Empire affair, is unreliable and has broken more </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">than </span><span class="font12">one peace agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">'“There has been no unity of purpose for the common good,” says the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “They have been more busy in intriguing to supplant one another in power and in office than in defending the national interests. They have lost the confidence of the Allies in their stability, and have to a great extent alienated the sympathy of the Entente. They do not listen to the advice of those to whom they owe the restoration of their independence. They do not adhere to their pledges, and manifest disregard for the engagements entered into in their name by their properly accredited plenipotentiaries abroad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Among the items in the Wilson [Empire] administration credits to foreign borrowers were: “Navy supplies to [papal] Poland $2,266, 709.66”. As Poland is an inland country this sounds like one of the Wilson notes addressed to Switzerland requesting the cooperation of the Swiss navy. Senator Reed made the charge in January that $40,000,000 of the money advanced to Poland for relief was spent on the Polish army, though this was “denied” by friends of the Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Between Germany and Poland lies Silesia, an important coal and industrial section, German territory for 700 years, developed by Germany before the war, which has been voted to Germany in the recent plebiscite, but “internationalized” by the papalized League for thirty years. In the steps for the vote the Papal Empire took strong action for Catholic Poland and against Protestant Germany. According to the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies,</span><span class="font12"> the Polish priests organized religious pilgrimages and conducted propaganda from the pulpit, until the Pope, seeing that they were going a little too far for the usual secret methods, intervened through the Nuncio to Poland. According to an Empire journal: “Handbills have been distributed to the Roman Catholic population — the great majority of the people—declaring that a delegation of Upper Silesian Poles visited the famous shrine of the Virgin Mary at Czensto-chowa, and asked her whether she desired Upper Silesia to remain German or become Polish, and that she distinctly said ‘Polish’.” The loss of the Silesian coal fields would complete the economic ruin of the Protestant part of Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pearson’s Magazine</span><span class="font12"> for March, 1921, vividly compares Catholic Poland and Upper Silesia under Protestant auspices:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Poles, who prefer to remain under German rule, have very intelligible reasons for desiring the superior civilization. They are mostly miners-; and they know very well that in all matters of health, housing, payment, safety, insurance and labor conditions generally, they are infinitely better off under Germany. They knajy something of the dirt, disorder, disease, poverty and oppression across the frontier. They know also that even now the German mark is worth five or gii Polish marks. Above all, they are free from Conscription as they are, whereas under Poland they would be subject t&lt;\ a militarism much worse than that of Prussia ever was. To counteract these arguments, Korfanti [Papal Empire Polish general], under [papal] French protection, terrorizes todav, and-threatens, literally, mas.-acre tomorrow, if the plebiscite goes against</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Poland. . .If the plebiscite had been taken under [Protestant] British auspices, we could have awaited the result with some confidence. As it is we can only say that the [Papal] French are giving another proof rf their unfitness to decide any international question.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">General Korfanti did invade Upper Silesia as soon as the vote had gone in favor of Germany. Before that took place it was predicted by an official in Silesia, &quot;The Germans are entirely disarmed now; the peace saw to that. If the plebiscite does not go to suit them, a few thousand Poles smuggled across the border . would become patriotic Upper Silesians, burning to unite with. Mother Poland. Korfanti would be delighted to manage that.”—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nation, </span><span class="font12">May 25, 1921. The same </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span><span class="font12"> gives this gem illustrative of Empire methods:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Poland[Empire agents] made almost incredible efforts to play on the ignorance and the superstition of the Poles in Upper Silesia. I have a newspaper in my possession written in Polish and. published in Kat-towitz. Its leading article is by a Polish, priest, setting forth with much detail that the Holy Virgin was really born in Czenstochowa—a Polish town containing a holy shrine—that she speaks and understands only Polish, that everyone must pray to her in Polish, and vote for Poland in the plebiscite!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What a paradise for the priests would be “America made Catholic”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fraud and Bluff</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12"> S THE Papal Empire destined to rise and fill the earth! Are the deeds of the dark ages to be indefinitely repeated! Is the world to bow forever under the Egyptian bondage, political, economic and religious, of the Pope of Rome and his all-embracing super-government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Empire is a tissue of fraud and bluff. Says the London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nation,</span><span class="font12"> of April 27, 1967, speaking of the expose of papal methods in connection with the then famous Montagnini papers: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Another method, that of carrying things off by whit can only be described as an impudent and mendacious policy of bluff, has been preferred by the clerical press and its supporters. The publication of the Montagnini papers in France, while described as an outrage on th* part of the French Government, has resulted, it is said [by them], in the discrediting of the French Ministry and the justification of the Vatican; and so loudly and so repeatedly has this been asserted that some at least of those who have committed themselves to the statement, it seems, have hypnotized themselves into the belief that it is true.” This is a characteristic instance of Papal Empire bluff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Tlu* alleged strength of the Papal Empire in the United States is another gigantic bluff. The thoroughly loyal adherents of the Empire are insignificant in number—less than a sixth of the population; they depend for their power on the vote of the other five-sixths, who are becoming awakened to the fact; their chief political lever, the saloon, with its blocks of votes to control the balance of power is gone; in business they are chiefly in subordinate places, which they have utilized in so many instances to betray the . interests of employers by filling the business with eo-inembers of the Empire, that the room of Empire devotees is coming to be considered more welcome than their company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In all the centuries the Popes in nearly every instance have Ix en Italians. Italy with 40.000, 000 population compared with the 2S8.000.000 memltership of the Papal Empire, or 13.9 percent, has the Pope, and thirty-three out of sixty-six cardinals, or fifty-three percent, a controlling interest in the concern. Contributions and gifts of the papal world flow like a golden river, the ransom of kings, into the Vatican.- In the entire history of the world, never did the in-fsiders in any scheme concoct so brilliant a plan for amassing wealth and exercising power without limit as these Italian ecclesiastics have done in .this Empire scheme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Balance of Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N PRACTICALLY every country in the world where the Papal Empire is a figure, it no longer possesses the dreaded power which it exercised during the dark past when whole populations were Catholic. It now relies upon that slender reed, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the balance of power.</span><span class="font12"> Those that have the balance of power are virtually rulers, because they are able'to vote this way or that and complete a sorely needed majority fpi; parties almost but not quite holding control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rut the tide against them is rising: and soon the balance.&lt;&gt;f power will vanish in the face of the all-powerl'ul non-Catholie parties, which will expos?-the obnoxious Empire and its methods, and sweep the Empire into oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dark Clouds in Sight - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font12">HAT are the signs which indicate the approaching obliteration of the so-called “super”-state?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">'‘Unless we willfully close our eyes to the -igns of the tor.u&gt;,” asserts Bishop Arthur J. Pro-.u i ts, D. D., of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">San Antonio, Texas, in the Brooklyn </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tablet,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;we cannot fail to see the dark clouds on the horizon, portending difficulties and persecution for the Church in America. There is, for instance, the growing tendency to tax all church property [including laundries, coal mines, etc.]......Would it not terribly cripple the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">activities of the Church, if this movement succeeded </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">T*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Justice Cohalan of New York has said, &quot;A great wave of anti-Catholicism is beginning to sweep the country”, and that in order to combat it Catholics must arm themselves with the formidable weapons of education and deeper spirituality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">They have had fifteen centuries of opportunity to show what they wanted to do in this direction, and now the time of their judgment has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Does it not seem strange,” complains Archbishop Hanna of San Francisco, in a sermon at St. Louis last October, “that after all our years of Catholic training in this land of ours, that our teachings have made so little impression upon the public mind of this nation?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is nothing strange to Americans. Oil and water do not mix; neither do &quot;reasonable” liberty and American liberty; and they cannot exist together on the same soiL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Archbishop Dowling of St Paul says in TAe </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New .World:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I venture to say to you that, so far, we Cat holies of the United States have done little or nothing which gives us the right to think or say that the future of the Church in this country is assured. Up to this, the faith of the American Catholic has been largely a derived faith, the faith of the immigrant, whether Irish, German, Polish, French, Italian, or whatever the country of its derivation may be. . . .1 repeat it, the Catholic movement in the United States, so far, has been largely controlled by the momentum it received in other lands, and bears the characteristics and the limitations of its origin. It is rather a congeries of movements, unrelated and disunited.....It does not yet appreciate the economics</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of combination, the strength of solidarity . . . .The literary expression of Catholic thought, being outside the range even of the best regulated pariah, is desultory, uneven, inadequate. Nobody who examines the publications which appear on the tables of the public libraries of Chicago, or any other large American eity in whose vicinities millions of Catholics live, would judge that the I 'atholic l»dy was anything but a timid, touchy, and a sur ly negligible group of citizens, who were not yet acclirmit •&lt;!.■'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In other words, it is hard to make this Italian weed flourish in the summer heats and wintry frosts of America’s bracing atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Statistics confirm the Dowling statement. American churches in 1920 gained 667,000 or 1.6 percent, an improvement over that of 1919, when the gain was 44,000 or 0.1 percent The indigenous churches showed fairly good growths in comparison with the 1.15 percent population increase, as follows: Methodist 3.0 percent, Presbyterian 1.97 percent and Baptist 1.9 percent The Boman Catholic net growth, assisted by only a small immigration, was 0.81 percent. The gross loss in membership is reported at 600,000 a year. Surely the country has got to have plenty of immigrants, or the Empire will show a shrinkage instead of a growth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N POLITICS and business the Empire is losing ground. In Boston, the citadel of &quot;Prince” O'Connell, the use of the uniforms of the army and navy, which Wilsonism [Empir-lam] would have allowed, was forbidden by President Harding in the parade for the recognition of the Irish Republic; and &quot;South Boston is sizzling tonight because of the stand taken by army and navy heads in this district,” comments the papalized </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font12"> At the MacSwiney parade some months before under acting president Tumulty the troops paraded in uniform. And &quot;reasonably” patriotic Mr. Harrigan, head of the Republic parade wired the President of the United States: &quot;Are these officials Americans or satellites of foreign governmentsT Are they autocrats, or is this a democracy! They say no authority can revoke .this decree. It is for Washington to say whether they are supreme. As Americans, we demand action in the name of 125,000 citizens of our state, and the revocation of orders from Ruckpian and Dunn” [Boston military and naval officers]. President Harding answered: “Anny and navy commanders have authority to direct the forces under their command&quot;. It is hard for Empire agents to give up the usurpations of the recent past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;Republicans get postmaster jobs,” which signifies that Papal Empire men must relinquish their secret espionage over the mail of </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font12">ericans and give way to loyal citizens of the country. “The Administration is about to make a clean swebp of Democratic Federal officials in Baltimore,'&quot;'-tsays the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font12"> Hon.

Isn't it about time that the same thing was done to the City Administration, beginning at the head [a Tammany selection]!” In numberless American cities the ejection of Empire agents is rapidly progressing or fully achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was a bitter disappointment to the Knights of Columbus that the American Legion did not walk into their trap to control the Legion through the $5,000,000 memorial building. Supreme Secretary William J. McGinley says:</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N THE &quot;church” in America there is trouble bubbling against religious autocracy. Sixty Catholic citizens protest to Archbishop Hayes of New York &quot;against the infusion of politics into the Catholic church”.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Among my acquaintances are many who have attended St Patrick's for years [th* Archbishop's church J —some since it was built—and they barely know th* names of their pastors, only aa they catch them from others.

Does not th* Archbishop think that the burning words of denunciation hurled at England on every occasion through pulpit and ‘secret’ teaching, are sufficient to place the blame for the recent outrage [the Union Club affair] at the door of the church? More openness and less secreqy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">would gratify many who are wavering on. the steps thereof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a priest is ejected from the parsonage for an alleged “long list of grievances, centering on an alleged dictatorial manner assumed in handling affairs of the congregation&quot;. In Waterbury a priest quits his pulpit to uphold his views, in defiance of the censure of Bishop John J. Nilan. Says the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register,</span><span class="font12"> of Toronto: “The so-called upper class of Catholics in America interpret freely the ordinances of Holy Church, when they condescend to notice them at all”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">South America is the hold of a dead hand. What little momentum there ia in her church life is maintained from without and not from within the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In all my recent Journeys on that continent during the last year, I saw scores of churches in a condition of decay more or less marked, and only two new churches in the process of erection. [The Bishop must not forget that 40,000 Protestant churches are vacant in the United States] Decay, mold, scores of bats flying through dilapidated ceilings; sagging roofs and fallen plaster are to be seen everywhere except in a few wealthy churches in the great cities of Argentina and Chile. Such conditions are only symbols of a deeper mental and spiritual decay, which leave the system open for the attacks which are being made upon it. These attacks come from three different local quarters: Governments, journalism, and the lecture platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Blow after blow is being struck at the body of South American Catholicism. One by one Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador have voted down the old Middle Age intolerance embodied in the laws, which made it a crime for 'any person to preach or teach or otherwise maintain, any doctrine or doctrines, contrary to those established by the Stats', substituting therefor complete or partial religious liberty. .... [And New York State passes a 1931 law forbidding religious classes except those of &quot;well-recognized” denominations, practically creating in the United States an established religion, in defiance of the American Constitution! But the Empire is near its end, even in New York State]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The journalism of South America strikes hard at Romanism. It does this openly and persistently, finding the superstition and immorality of the priests texts • for endless journalistic homilies. There is published in Buenos Aires a weekly comic paper like the ,4sino of Rome, and somewhat like </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> of New York. It is maintained partly for the purpose of ridiculing friars, priests and the Catholic faith in general. Its cartoons are leveled at immoral and medieval priestly leadership. It is estimated that two hundred thousand copies of this paper are sold weekly on the news stands, in the street cars and suburban trains of that metropolis of the Southern Hemisphere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And in Ne^r Y&lt;jrk it would be with fear of the mob, the assassin} the bomb and the boycott that a daily newspaper would emulate the liberty of the press of Argentina. In Michigan the Grand Rapids </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font12"> was threatened with Em</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">pire boycott. It came out against the Empire and in two months increased its circulation 3,000 copies &quot;because the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Newt</span><span class="font12"> could not be muzzled by the powerful influences that sought, first, to keep the parochial school amendment from going on the ballot and, second, because it dared • to favor the amendment”.

French clericals egged on poor Charles toward his crown in Hungary. Catholic France on one side and Catholic Poland on the other seek to appropriate most of Protestant Germany's coal lands and do what Charles V could not do, make her helpless. French power and intrigue back file Turkish Kemal to weaken certain central European countries. The “unholy trinity” in France favors the union of Catholic Austria with Catholic Bavaria, to further weaken the Protestant portion of Germany. Every place where there is turmoil in Europe, the hidden hand of the Papal Empire may be glimpsed; for the Empire profits by the sudden advantages gained in warfare. But the tide is rising in France, and America’s sister Republic soon is expected to take her place again as a friend of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Army after army was thrown against Russia by Poland and the French Imperialists, bankers and clericals, and no more bitter disappointment cams to the Vatican than the downfall of Kerensky, Kolchak, Denikin, and Wrangel, on whom many hopes had been pinned of fairer days for the Papal Empire. “Viviani fails in American mission,” a headline in a New York paper, brought no brightness to Empire circles. It was no longer the pro-papal Wilson that had to be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If the wfeepiftg Charles had, with his co-plotter Bishop-Mikes, won the throne of Hungary, though it had plunged many people into war, it would have greatly advantaged the Pope, but the journey “only brought him disappointment and disillusionment”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Jugoslavia, formerly Servia, where Papal interference brought on the World War, there has just been a considerable weakening of the Clerical [Empire] Party, which with the Moslems and moderate Radicals had constituted the last Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Roumania is giving the Empire no rest. According to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Bishop Count Majlath appeared before St. Peter’s [Empire] throne as a plaintiff about the hard-lot imposed on Latin Catholies in New Roumania. The Government is trying by violent measures to propagate a schism at the expense of the Catholic Chureh and is slowly sapping Catholic ecclesiastical [Empire] life, the liberty [to plot]&quot; of the religious communities [of monks and friars] and the right of disposing of Catholic churches. In consequence there is a general legal uncertainty in Catholic life, unworthy of a civilized state. The lot of the rural clergy is especially sorrowful. Deprived of support, many Catholic ecclesiastics were obliged to leave their posts and to accept positions as officials or teachers. [Oh, grief and sorrow—to have to work for a living!] Priests defending ecclesiastical rights [Canon Law] against the state-power, were arrested and, according to Hungarian papers, some Catholic ecclesiastics are said to have been punished even by cudgelling. [Must be hard for them to learn to obey the law] In Cziz-Czereda all the seculars [monks] have been punished with twenty-five conings because they sang a hymn of Our Lady in the Hungarian language. A Roumanian Official censor is present at all sermons and occasionally interrupts the preacher if the latter turns aside from the religious topic approved by the censor [stops political speeches from the pulpit]. On All Souls Day, Roumanian soldiers destroyed candles in many churcli yards in Transylvania. [Candles are expensive when the laity pay for them],... With what hardness they proceed is shown by the fact that the Government forbade all pilgrimages to the Roman Catholic Pilgrimage Maria Radna, and expelled the Franciscans of that place except two” [who probably obeyed the law].</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In India, according to the Madras </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mail,</span><span class="font12"> quoting the Jesuit Archbishop of Bombay, “often it has seemed that the very fabric of the Church [Empire] in India was endangered”. On account of their Jesuit anti-government activities </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">America,</span><span class="font12"> a Jesuit organ, says: “Seventeen Oblates of Mary were put into concentration camps in Ceylon. The same indignity was soon inflicted upon twenty-five Jesuits in Bombay. A similar fate overtook many others. Deportations began. From India alone eighty-eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">priests, twenty-four clerics and Brothers and twenty-five Sisters were carried away.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">America </span><span class="font12">calls this, as it would call the former expulsions of Jesuits from many nations, &quot;a great crime against Christianity”. “The world [Empire] is sad,&quot; it concludes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When “Bible-Burning Dougherty”, as Archbishop, burned 2,000 Protestant Bibles in a <sup>1</sup> public square in the Philippines, it so interested the public that they bought 3,000 more of the ’ Bibles.

The Fascist! • &quot;shoot up” Socialists, and the latter shoot back, and more trouble has started than the Italians know what to do with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Pope Benedict makes capital out of his clemency in calling off the “war” which has been on since 1870 between the Papal Empire and the Italian Government. His Holiness cancels the famous veto against Catholic princes visiting the Vatican or the king of Italy until the “war” should be wound up. This enables the kings of Spain, Belgium and other places to come and call, and is exploited as an illustration of the kindly beneficence of the head of the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The facts are that the right-about-face of the Vatican was forced by the common people. As reported in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> the Spanish people felt that it was an indignity to the throne for Alfonso to be prohibited from visiting anyone he wanted to. Things at home were being made so unpleasant for Alfonso that he brought pressure to bear on the Pope to let up on him. Albert, king of the Belgians, felt bad that he alone of the heads of the Allies was unable to call on either the King of Italy or the head of the Empire. So the Pope called off the war with Italy, Alfonso will call first, according to the Baltimore </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is still more trouble in Italy, because the Protestant &quot;rebels” have .“invaded” the country. The Protestant “offensive” has taken the fohn b f huge-caliber Bibles, missions, schools,-tolieges, hospitals, dispensaries, orphan asylums, cooking schools, farm colonies, visiting nurses, charities and social-service. Some 80,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">persons have become Protestant through the preaching and teaching. This &quot;enemy” proposes , to reduce the defences of the Empire at the 1 <sup>: </sup>capital, Rome. “To the tenacity of Protestant- * j ism’s plans for conquest the Catholics of the ■ Latin nations must oppose a watchful resistance - । that overlooks nothing.&quot; The people rather , like the attacks by a people more nearly Christian than those in charge of the Empire. The Red Cross abroad, too, is &quot;in bad”. Father Mao Mahon says that &quot;the war brought Catholics ' into contact with un-Catholic [Protestant] principles”; the Bed Cross had &quot;taken the body from i.; the cross as its symbol, a symbol of shame when unrelated to the body”. The Y. M. C. A., too—. though doing an immense amount of good work —&quot;fails to realize that love of neighbor is secon- ; dary to love of God”.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“I began to see and understand the evil sources of !; the sad Church conditions in America, and of the , world-wide contempt for Church administration. Many -American Bishops, before going to Rome, order a special : collection, as a special gift from the diocese to the Pope. ■ The Cardinals and the Monsignors in Rome can tell who is receiving that money and for what purpose. Bribes, favors and misrepresentations have never agreed with truth and justice. Where protected privilege rules, truth and justice are banished. This is the reason why f so many priests say: ‘There is no justice in the Church'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“I visited nearly every church in Rome. They contain priceless works of art, but are practically used as public museums by the foreign visitors. Practically speaking, the Italian people of Rome are not going to church. . The open disrespect in the churches for the Blessed Sacrament is unbelievable to American Catholics...

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Church government of Rome was rejected [by the Italian people] because it was a government of favors, and of influence against common rights.

<h6><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Away From Rome!</span></h6>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N PROTESTANT Bohemia, camouflaged as &quot;Czechoslovakia”, a tremendous movement is under way, an exemplification of the fact that the world is breaking away from Rome. The “church” press puts it thus in language reminding of the dark ages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' “Information has been conveyed to the Holy See,” says the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic News,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> “that some priests of the Bo-hemisjir clergy, at whose instigation senseless requests had been previously made from the same See, held these days an illegitimate meeting, proclaimed with an attempt at schism, separation from the church of Rome, the Mother and Teacher of all other churches and the Center of ■ Unity, and constituted themselves into what they call a national church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Supreme Sacred Congregation [department] of the Holy Office [Empire] on which rests the obligation of guarding faith and morals, heartily detesting so grave a crime, believes it to be its duty to lose no time in reproving, condemning, and excommunicating the above named church, which in point of fact through the present decree, in the name and by the authority of Our Sovereign Lord, Benedict XV, reproves, condemns and excommunicates. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It will be necessary to inflict upon them as soon as possible all the other penalties and irregularities established by the Sacred Canons. [Catholic Poland's mobilfcefi army, for instance] The Bishops [Empire officials afld thought-controllers] of Bohemia, as is their ■ duty, will take steps to bring the import of the present decree at once to the knowledge of the faithful entrusted to their care in the manner which they deem most suitable, and to dissuade them by every means • from yielding support to the schismatic faction so that the faithfuHthemselves may not fall under the same excommunication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The extent of the damage to the Empire may be estimated from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Baltimore American:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Priests of all orders, as well as those who during the Austrian regime </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">contributed millions of crowns yearly to the Catholic treasury,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> have joined this formidable separatist movement, with the result that hundreds of churches .are no longer celebrating mass, while the few remaining Boman Catholic priests are unable to find more than 10,000 of their flock in all Bohemia. More than a million Bohemians have left the Romanist ranks, generally taking the church buildings and priests with them, and allying themselves with the new national church of Czechoslovakia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the League of Nations—“the image of the beast” (Revelation 13:14)—has a chance to shows its usefulness to the Pope, of whom it is asserted: “The Pope is the League”; for “it is understood that Papal officials are considering making an appeal to the League of Nations to induce Czechoslovakia to pay for the churches which were taken without the slightest formalities, as well as to indemnify the former priests until the chaos in central Europe is overcome”—in other words, have somebody w’age war on Bohemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was in 1415 A. D. that the Papal Empire seized, and burned at the stake, as a heretic, the martyr John Huss. In 1921 the ghost of a wicked past rises across the way of the Empire, and in all Bohemia the unanswerable question is thundered at Rome: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Why did you burn John Huss?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is a most momentous event when a whole nation remembers the spirit of its great past, breaks the shackles of autocracy, and steps out of darkness into light. A fire has been kindled in Bohemia which shall burn the Papal Empire to ashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1914 the clock of the ages struck the hour for the beginning of the divinely ordained destruction of the Papal Empire and its Protestant associates. We see the fire blazing in Bohemia. In Roumania it smoulders. In South America “the smoke of her torment ascends”. In many countries the fire is warming up. In the United States it blazed up momentarily in the 1920 elections. The next few years will see the whole world aflame against this Papal Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fire that burns the Empire is the beacon light of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Students of the Bible, from the Reformers to the present time, find that the Papal Empire was foreknown by God and clearly delineated in the prophetic Scriptures:</span></p>

In Revelation as a component part of a series of ferocious beasts (governments by violence) — Revelation 12: 3-17; 13:1-10, 12-18; 18:1-7, 1524; 19:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Its acts and characteristics: Daniel 7:8,11, 21,25; 8:10-12, 23-25; Revelation 2: 9,13-15, 20; 4: 9,15-17; 13: 5-10; 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Its imminent dissolution: Daniel 2:34,35; 5: 25-30; 7:11,26; 8: 25; Revelation 15:8; 16:19; 17 :.8,14,16; 18: 2,5-10. 20,21; 19: 2, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The affairs of the present order of things are so shot through with those of the Papal Empire, that the end of the one connotes that of the other. Both are wrecked by increasing knowledge among the common people. Both are</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">shams and humbugs. The existing &quot;civilization* : is anything but civilized. The Papal Empire, to which is practically ended, is a small counterfeit of the real kingdom of God, which is com-ing—&quot;Thy Kingdom come.” The Papal Empire &nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">comprises the insignificant fraction of seventeen ' percent of the world’s population; God’s King- I dom will include a hundred percent.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Economizing Gasoline:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">HE question of supply and demand of gasoline is becoming a serious proposition in many portions of the United States today, and we are told it is much more serious in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not many months ago, in central Indiana, the attention of the writer was called to long lines of autos at a filling station, awaiting their turn to get gasoline. It was said that the demand far exceeded the supply and that whenever the auto owners learned that a certain filling statiort was getting a supply of gasoline, they would go immediately to get in line for limited supply. The limit was placed at two gallons for touring cars and three gallons for trucks at fifty cents per gallon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Any invention that has a tendency to economize gasoline becomes a matter of vital interest to practically all car owners; and if the invention can, by demonstration, prove itself meritorious, something worth while has come to the surface. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thibwriter has looked into the merits of the Carbur-aid that was brought to our attention in a recent issue of The Golden Age; and in my humble judgment, this invention will do much toward .economizing gasoline and, to some extent at least, relieve the situation of gasoline shortage lb certain localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My investigation shows that the principle involved in this invention is that of vaporizing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By P. D. Pottle</span><span class="font12"> (D. O'.) the gasoline before it enters the ignition chamber. The vaporization, I find, is accomplished by abstracting hbt air from the engine, carrying it to the Carbur-aid by means of a metal tube, The hot air passes through the fan of the device along with the limited supply of gasoline; and a hot gasoline vapor is thus produced, which . increases the motive power of a given quantity of gasoline to a remarkable degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is a known fact that liquid gasoline will produce carbon when it is burned. This is caused by the excessive quantity of coal oil therein, or a lack of proper refining. Vaporized gasoline, produced by means of hot air, explodes readily, with greatly increased power, and consumes the entire liquid; the oil portions being greatly atomized and vaporized at the same time and entirely consumed in the explosion. It can be readily reasoned that a vapor thus produced will not only be higher in power efficiency, but additionally, be practically free from the carbon-producing quality of the ordinary method of producing power from gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was the pleasure of the writer to ride in a Ford machine in a test trip of the Carbur-aid, . ■&quot;* the trip covering approximately 48 miles; and while I do not remember the actual saving recorded in that trip, I do know that it was considerably over one-third of the quantity of gasoline consumed in operating without the ‘ Carbur-aid.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">Personally I think this invention should merit the investigation of our Government officials who are interested in the law of Supply and Demand of gasoline, to the end that it may be the means of greater savings along this line and possibly a decrease in the price thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">[The C'arbur-aid, mentioned in The Goi.den Age for April 13, 1921, seems to be giving very excellent results everywhere, from reports which Yeach our office. We learn that with its use Ford owners are obtaining 25 to 36 miles to a gallon of gasoline where the previous average was 17 miles. Some </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">large eouctn n»,</span><span class="font12"> as Ine. Proctor and Gamble Company, makers of the famous Ivory soap, are installing the Carbnr-' aid on all their Ford machines.

<h5><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>Perfume—$5 a Drop </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph Greig</span></h5>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12"> CURRENT news-item records how tire Parisian elite are all agog over a new perfume which is being sold at $5 a drop. It is said to be produced from seaweed, of which a whole ton yields only five drops. It is declared to be the most exquisite scent known to man. While many claim that the price of this special brand is extremely exorbitant, yet the best attar of roses manufactured at Ghazipoor in Hindustan, before the war, commanded as much -as $100 a fluid ounce or 21 cents a drop. We learn that it requires 400,000 well-grown roses to produce an ounce of attar. Hence the rate by comparison is not overly high. Besides, when it is figured how much pleasure this new scent can give those who heretofore have spent a like amount per bottle for champagne, it is seen as a substitute of real social value. Thus • the sense of delicacy of taste in vintages is now giving place to a fineness of smell, analogous to that of pointer-dogs and hounds, that trace the scent of persons beyond any humanpowers to follow. The case, however, is cited of James Mitchell, who was born blind, deaf and dumb, but whose sense of smell was so acute as to distinguish any person in his presence by the different personal odor of the bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. We remember in the trying experiences of the'AIaster how Mary broke an alabaster box of precious ointment at a time which fore-marked the Savior’s burial. We remember also how Judas complained at the expense of such outpour ing, of her sacred cruse, hypocritically making excuse that it would serve the poor better if sold and the money distributed, flow few saw, like Mary, the occasion as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Iteyond all </span><span class="font12">other acts of affection! Hence her name is heralded to this day as illustrating the spirit of the Christian gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In these days of great stress, how much a kind word helps those bearing a cross, to press forward again with renewed courage. Indeed, the distribution of some of this spiritual attar of roses pent up in the human alabaster box— the heart—will scent the very atmosphere with its sweet odor of love. In the glorious Golden Age this spirit of brotherly interest will spread quickly as the superior influence, rendering comfort and blessing to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a practical illustration of how man-will catch this holy power, we heard of a man who thought to experiment with the doctrine of reciprocity by clearing his neighbor’s walk of snow one morning. The next snow-fall showed how well the act was interpreted; for straightway the neighbor getting up earlier had returned the courtesy. Again, when a larger snow-fall permitted the repetition of the service for an entire block, it so touched the heart of the neighborhood, as to provoke them to build a plow and drag the squares for blocks around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No doubt in the Golden Age the present competitive system of greed will so melt before the entrance of this sweet perfume of the Christian spirit, as to bring in helpfulness and reciprocal joys and blessings untold. For we recall the well-known fact of chemistry that one grain of musk will scent an entire room for a whole year. Thus the exquisite perfume of Christ’s presence in the Golden Era will transform the desolate places of the heart, by introducing that perennial fragrance characteristic of his kingdom. Living now at the very portals of this regime, we can begin to sense by anticipation, some of the sweet aromatic nosegays of this Golden Millennium with its everlasting and pellucid waters. No wonder we pray, &quot;Thy kingdom come”, for it guarantees everlasting delight and rejoicing, such as will satisfy every longing soul. Then, all hail the Golden Age, as in the words of the poet betokening a world remade, we sing:</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font12">&gt;HE day of miracles is past. This is what the average man of today would reply if that subject was mentioned to him. You may think that he is right: but if I were to hand you a lump of black shiny rock and a cup full of water, declaring that from these materials I could obtain power sufficient to run all the machines in the world, you would agree that if I spoke the truth I would be performing a miracle. This very miracle is just what the steam engine accomplishes, deriving its power from coal and water. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It seems paradoxical to say that one can obtain an enormous fire from water. Yet hydrogen and oxygen, the sole elements of water, when used in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, furnish a flame whose heat is surpassed only by that of the electric furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;All the water gleamed with gladness;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Every streamer in the sky</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seemed like arms of little children</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Flung in joyouanesa on high; — &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">All the birds on all the bushes Joined, their melody to pour— Surely never was a morning Ushered in like this before!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By C. Bushnell (Conn.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To take the same coal and water which runs a steam engine and to build up from it sugar -which we can use to sweeten our coffee is nothing short of miraculous; but this is just what synthetic chemists have done in synthesizing sugar from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Again, we will dissolve our lump of coal in molten iron and drop the white hot mass into water. When the iron is dissolved away, by the use of hydrochloric acid, diamonds will remain —very minute diamonds, of course, but dia- $ monds nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Without going further than producing power, great heat, confectionery and jewelry from a lump of coal and a&quot; cup of water we can reason- &gt;&nbsp;ably conclude that the day of miracles is not past.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Personal Items </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By Captain ~N.T.Hartshorn</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Af«, 80 Year*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12"> SPENT a year at Hartshorn, England, looking up my family history. I found that the Hartshorns were outlawed for resisting William the Conqueror after the battle of Hastings. Scott wrote &quot;Ivanhoe” at Hartshorn and he gives a man by the name of Hartshorn credit for some of the data on which Ivanhoe was composed. He represents the people of that section as composing Robin Hood’s band, so it seems natural for me to be an &quot;outlaw”. Scott gives a fine description of them in the narrative &quot;Ivanhoe” of the siege of Torquilstone Castle and the tournament at Hartshorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While at Hartshorn I learned that the vicar at one&gt;f the Established churches there went to Loudon and coveted something he saw and stole it; he was caught and convicted, but the warden went to London and got him off, being a clergyiqan. .After a time he went to London and stole some other things, was caught and convicted.'<sup>1</sup> The warden told me that this time he let him take his medicine—serve his time out. I went to hear him preach when he came back. You see the law is that once the living is bestowed it holds good for life. Even if a minister commits murder and is imprisoned, when he gets out he returns to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another case. At Dalton, England, I had </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">commission from a Church of England vicar for his portrait. He was wealthy, also an amateur artist, had a studio in his vicarage, and his principal fad was painting the portraits of nude women. When I went for sittings, sometimes I would find him intoxicated. Imagine the character of such a man!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Well! He wanted a new east window in his church: so he rigged up a wooden cross, stretched himself on it and was photographed, sent the print to the stained-glass worker and had it rendered life-size, full-length, in stained glass, likeness and all, and put up in the church. The people were horrified and sent for the bishop. The vicar himself told me all this and said the bishop could do nothing; he said the photographer brought out the negative and proved it on him; but they could not oust him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The living of the rectorship of Leicester, England, (200,000 inhabitants) is in the gift of the Jockey Club; perhaps they don’t give it a sporting rector?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In talking with people in England I said, “These eases 'are probably rare&quot;. People laughed and said, “Why, there are such cases all over England”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I love the English people, but any man who</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">knows the facts knows that the English people and the British imperial system are two sepa^ rate things. Imperialism will steadily gravitate to the side of British imperialism, whether it • be ecclesiastical imperialism or political imperialism. Some seem to hate the Catholio system so heartily that they will swallow the image of it without a qualm, not realizing that both must go down to destruction.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12"> THEATRE man in an Eastern Pennsylvania town opened a moving picture house, anu was experiencing some opposition from the six clergymen of the place, his being the first public entertainment house there.

Finally the movie man said to his spouse, the sharer of his joys and sorrows: &quot;Wife, you put on your best duds, and come along with me, and watch me shut those fellows up”.

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">'I MOOSIC, Pa., lives the Piasky family, consisting of a father, a hard-working railroad man, a mother and three pairs of twins, each pair consisting of a boy and a girl. The twins are, as is usually the case, extremely fond of each other, and none of the children seem ever able to get clearly before their minds the thought that they are all on the same footing. In one case one of the children got into some little difficulty with a neighbor’s child and although her elder brother was present was obliged to submit to some injustice. Learning of the circumstance the mother said to the eldest son: &quot;Joseph, why did you not take the part of your little sister?” Promptly the youth responded,“It is the business of her own brother to do that ”, meaning by that the twin that is usually the little girl’s constant companion. The-parents find a great deal of amusement in watching the. development of the curious pranks of nature in their family.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>Nature’s Lessons in Divinity </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By Lena M. Jameson</span></h5>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font12">HAT great lessons a Christian may learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M.rom the little things of life, and what wonderful picture-lessons can be drawn from simple nature! This has been set forth, for example, by our Lord in a most beautiful wordpicture: “Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil ^iot,khey spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these”. (Luke 12:27) Thus our Lord taught by illustrating the* great truth that had man never taken himself and his posterity out from under the protecting care of the Creator by disobedience in the garden of Eden, he would have never had to toil unduly or under unfavorable condtions (Genesis 3:19), but would have ever been nourished, cared for and arrayed by the Master-hand of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of a truth the whole world lieth in wickedness and sin. Their toil is but in vain; and they reap only sorrow and disease in their harvests. Is there hope for deliverance? Yes! This is elaborately depicted by the majestic century-plant of California. This plant ia very rough and ragged, and covered with sharp-pointed thorns. The older it grows, the more rough and misshapen it looks, although it still retains a semblance of great majesty. Thus seems to be pictured the exceeding sinfulness of sin and its corresponding degeneracy and degradation. At the same time it shows the majesty of the out-workings of God's great plan for the human race. But marvelous to behold 1 After a century of this kind of existence the ugly century-plant bursts into a blaze of glory and beauty. The whole top is a huge bouquet of the most exquisite flowers ever beheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Imagine the significance of this picture. When the tops of the mountains (governments — Isaiah 64:1-3: 2:2) have all become subservient to the great King, His glorious kingdom wilt fill the whole earth with righteousness, beauty and blessing. Then the original curse will have been removed. One man will no longer plant, and another reap. One will not build, and another inhabit. But every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and will plant and eat the fruits thereof. The banner of the great King will be, Justice and Equity for the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Who is this great. Kling! Christ our Lord! Yes. Is He to rule alone! No. Have we a simple picture of this! Yas, indeed, in the government of our own country. Does the President rule alone! No. We have a Congress, or ruling &quot;body,” associated with him. This fittingly illustrates the governing power of the next age, the Golden Age, or Kingdom of Christ. Our Lord is to be the head or president; and all through the gospel age He has been selecting His governing body—the few sincere Christians who have followed faithfully in His steps even at the risk of great hardship and persecution. These are they who have been tried and found faithful and true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How is the King to appear, and how are His governing body to appear with Him 7 They will never ajftpear to the eye of.the natural man; for they are to be changed to spirit nature, and natural men cannot behold spirit beings. Their presence will be discerned, however, by their power and authority in the world. The degrading spiritual influence of Satan over the minds of men will'he superseded by the enlightening spiritual influence of Christ, in like manner, over the minds of men. Christ and His body will then exercise a great power and influence in the world for righteousness and justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have we a picture, from simple nature, of the selection and preparation of the governing body and of the requirements attached thereto!. We surely have! What is-man that God is mindful of him, and the son of man that God should visit him (Psalm 8:4) and offer him so great an honor and exaltation as to lift him from the form of miry clay to spirit nature, and give great power and authority over the earth! What is man but a worm!—Psalm 22:6.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let us take the ugly caterpillar as a picture of man’s fall and degradation. The caterpillar is the most despised and insignificant of the lower forms of creation. It crawls low, never ascending far above tfie surface of the earth. Its power of perception is very limited, and its life as a worm is short in duration. After a time what do we find has happened to the ugly worm! It has turned into a silent, apparent!/ lifeless corpse. How like our Master's words, &quot;Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bring-eth forth much fruit”. (John 12:24) And how -like the requirement attached to the selection of the body of Christ! They are to be “faithful unto death”; they are to “die with Him, that they may also reign with Him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Did our Lord and Head die! He did, leaving ■ us an example of how we should suffer and die if faithfid in all things to Him and His principles of righteousness. Did He rise from the dead! He did, on the third day. So also with the ugly cocoon. Does it always remain a cocoon! No. It is changed into the most glorious of creatures, a beautiful fairy-like butterfly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Shall we be changed? &quot;We shall all be changed . . . into the same image.” (1 Corinthians 15: 51, 52; 2 Corinthians .3:18) What a glorious promise to the faithful gospel church! They will be changed from human to divine, transferred from natural to spiritual, to inhabit forever the heavenlies with our Lord in all glory and beauty, vested with all power to resurrect and bring back to earthly perfection all of the human race now dead and dying, and to bless them richly and restore them to peace and happiness. Mankind will live right here on the earth: but the desires of their hearts will be more than answered, and their wants more than supplied, by the King and His reigning body, the glorified church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- Can all be the King, and all the Congress! No. A kingdom implies a king and subjects. To illustrate: In a school, can all be teachers! No; a school implies a teacher and pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Great will be the rejoicing of the whole world of mankind when in the near future they are brought forth from the tomb and blessed by the new spiritual control, Christ's kingdom. All their sighing and all their tears will forever _ cease, and the desire of all nations will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Even now the kingdom is being ushered in. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">old selfish order is being swept away, to make room for the new order of &quot;Justice for the people”. Millions of humanity now living will never die if they will turn to righteousness and conform themselves to the requirements of the new King. These requirements will be righteousness, justice and brotherly love; and their influence will increase until it covers the whole earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God speed the day when Christ shall reign And still the troubled sea, Quiet the tumult and the storm</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And rule in equity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD'S PLAN THE BEST PLAN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">239. TVAat is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the chief objection to a separate trial for each individual at first?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">But there are two other objections to the plan suggested, of trying each individual separately at first. One Redeemer was quite sufficient in the plan which God adopted, because only one had sinned and only one had been condemned. (Others shared </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font12"> condemnation) But if the first trial had been an individual trial, and if one-half of the race had sinned and been individually condemned, it would have required the sacrifice of a redeemer for each condemned individual. One unforfeited life could redeem one forfeited life, but no more. The'one perfect man, “the man Christ Jesus,” who redeems the fallen Adam (and our losses through him), could not have been “a ransom [a corresponding price] for all” under any other circumstances than those of the plan which God chose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If we should suppose the total number of human beings since Adam to be one hundred billions, and that only one-half of these had sinned; it would require all of the fifty billions of obedieht, perfect men to die in order to give a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font12"> [a corresponding price] for all the fifty billions of transgressors; and so by this plan also death would pass upon all. And such a plan woijd involve </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">no less</span><span class="font12"> suffering than is at present experienced.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">240.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> How would such an individual trial have affected the divine plan for. the selection of the church ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">The other objection to such a plan is that it would seriously disarrange God’s plans relative to the selection and exaltation to the divine nature of a ‘little flock”, the body of Christ, *a company of which Jesus is the Head and Lord. God could not justly </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">command</span><span class="font12"> the fifty billions of obedient sons to give their rights, privileges and lives as the ransom for sinners; for under His own law their obedience would have won the right to lasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hence, if those perfect men were asked to become ransomers of the fallen ones it would be God’s plan, as with our Lord Jesus, to set some special reward before them, so that they, for the joy set before them, might endure the penalty of their brethren. And if the same reward should be given them that was given our Lord Jesus, namely, to partake of a new nature, the divine, and to be highly exalted above angels and principalities and powers, and every name that is named—next to Jehovah (Ephesians 1: 20, 21), then there would be an immense number on the divine plane, which the wisdom of God evidently did not approve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Furthermore, these fifty billions, under snch circumstances, would be on an equality, and none .among them chief or head, while the plan God </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">has adopted</span><span class="font12"> calls for but one Redeemer, one highly exalted to the divine nature, and then a “little flock” of those whom He redeemed, and who “walk in His footsteps” of suffering and self-denial, to share His name, His honor, His glory and His nature, even as the wife shares with the husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDEMNING ALL IN ONE OPENED UP'THE WAY FOB RANSOM AND RESTITUTION BY ONE REDEEMER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">241.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Bow do those who fully appreciate this feature of God's plan, viz., the condemnation of all in one representative, find in it the solution of many perplexities ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Those who can appreciate this feature of God’s plan, which, by condemning all in one representative, opened the way for the ransom and restitution of all by one Redeemer, will find in it the solution of’ many perplexities. They will see that the condemnation of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> in one was the reverse of an injury; it'was a great favor to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> when taken in connection with God’s plan for providing justification for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font12">through another one’s sacrifice. Evil will he forever extinguished when God’s purpose .in permitting it shall have been accomplished, and when the benefits of the ransom are made coextensive with the penalty of sin. It is impos-' sible, however, to appreciate rightly this feature of the plan of God without a full recognition of the sinfulness of sin, the nature of its penalty— death—the importance and value of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ransom </span><span class="font12">which our Lord Jesus gave, and the positive and complete restoration of the individual to favorable conditions, conditions under which he will have full and ample trial, before being adjudged worthy of the reward (lasting life), or of the penalty (lasting death).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE PERMISSION OF EVIL GOD’S ATTRIBUTES STAND OUT MOST EESPLENDENTLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">242. IVEat </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">blessings will eventually result through the permission of evil? And how will the wisdom, justice, love and power of the divine character be more fully manifested through this method than through any other conceivable by the finite mind?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">In view of the great plan of redemption and the consequent “restitution of all things” • through Christ, we can see that blessings result through the permission of evil which, probably, could not otherwise have been so fully realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not only are men benefited to all eternity by the experience gained, and angels by their ob-servatron. of man’s experiences, but all are further advantaged by a fuller acquaintance with God’s character as manifested in His plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When His plan is fully accomplished all will be able to read clearly His wisdom, justice, love and power. They will see the. justice which could not violate the divine decree, nor save the justly condemned race without a full cancellation of their penalty by a willing Redeemer. <sup>i</sup> They will see the love which provided this noble sacrifice and which highly exalted the Redeemer to God’s own right hand, giving Him power _ and authority thereby to restore to life those whom He purchased with His own precious ' blood. They will also see the power and .wisdom which were able to work out a glorious destiny for His creatures, and so to overrule every opposing influence as to make them either the willing or the unwilling agents for the advancement and final accomplishment of His grand designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Had evil not been permitted and thus overruled by divine providence, we cannot see how these results could have been attained. The permission of evil for a time among men thus displays a far-seeing wisdom, which grasped all the attendant circumstances, devised the remedy, and marked the final outcome through God’s power and grace. .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">243.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> What purpose has the permission of sin and its concomitant evils served in the discipline and development of the church? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">During the gospel dispensation sin and its attendant evils have been further made Use of for the discipline and preparation of the church. Had sin not been permitted, the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus and of His church, the reward of which is the divine nature, would have been impossible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">244. TFAaf </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is the expression of the divine law which must eventually govern all of God's intelligent creatures? And how will the permission of evil be ultimately regarded by all creatures in heaven and on earth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">It seems clear that substantially the same law of God which is now over mankind, obedience to which has the reward of life, and disobedience the penalty of death, must ultimately govern all of God’s intelligent creatures: and that law, as our Lord defined it, is briefly comprehended in the one word. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lore—</span><span class="font12">“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength; and thy neighbor as thyself”. (Luke 10: 27) Ultimately, when the purposes of God shall have been accomplished, the glory of the divine character will be manifest to all intelligent creatures, and the temporary permission of evil will be seen by all to have been a wise feature in the divine policy. Now, this can be seen only by the eye of faith, looking onward through God’s Word at the tilings spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began—the restitution of all things.</span></p>

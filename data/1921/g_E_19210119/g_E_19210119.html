<div>
<p><span class="font25">P</span><span class="font16">ENNSYLVANIA means literally “Penn’s Woods”, a very good name for what three f hundred years ago was an unbroken forest from h north to south and from east to west. At that * time most of the land from the Missouri River t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">the Atlantic Ocean and from the timber line</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Northern Canada to the Gulf was a primeval</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">* forest, and it is small wonder that the early settlers thought they had more forests than they needed and that the country would never <sub>;</sub> amount to anything until these were removed. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>i</sub>‘--f </span><span class="font16">Accordingly, within the next few generations, <sup>1</sup> | almost all of the great bodies of timber in the I country were transferred from public to private , hands; and the people who received these grants, not having more wisdom than their </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">g. rulers, </span><span class="font16">wrought such havoc and destruction in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font16">forests, and are still working to the same </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">end, </span><span class="font16">as to cause those to gasp who perceive what </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">' the </span><span class="font16">certain result will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Less than a hundred years ago a man’s value </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">the community depended largely upon his <sup>1</sup> ability as a worker in the clearing of land. Great trees that would now be worth fifty dollars each </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font16">the lumber they contain were felled and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">burned </span><span class="font16">where they fell, so that the land they &gt;&nbsp;covered could be utilized for crops worth less 1 than that amount for an entire acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">; , There are </span><span class="font16">men now living who can remember </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font16">black walnut forests in Southern Indiana </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were </span><span class="font16">disposed of in this way, which, if now</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">standing, would be worth a fabulous sum. When the World War came on, the United States gov</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">? ernment </span><span class="font16">found the greatest difficulty in locating enough black walnut to make the stocks required </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">, for </span><span class="font16">the rifles of its soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The situation that now confronts America is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">| I </span><span class="font16">that eighty percent of the standing merchant-I able timber is privately owned; and that the • people who own it have no interest in it what-■ ever except to obtain from it, as quickly as</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">possible, the wealth which it represents, and with no thought of responsibility as to its replacement.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>How the Forests are Going</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font16">HE annual cut of lumber in the United States is thirty billion feet. One region after another has been cut over and deserted by the lumber interests, and left a wilderness of stumps and underbrush. Only a few years ago one of the principal sources of lumber was in New England. Today fully thirty percent of all the lumber used in New England is brought in from other parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">New York was also a great lumber state. Today it is purchasing one hundred and twentyeight million dollars worth of lumber per year, and eighty million dollars worth of that amount is shipped into the state from other districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Less than a generation ago the Lake States were the greatest producers of lumber in the country. Today it is estimated that these states are paying a freight bill of six million dollars </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">year to bring in lumber and other forest products from outside sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The present field of destruction is in the South. One-half of the lumber now cut in the United States is Southern pine, and experts say that it will all be gone in fifteen years. It is now disappearing at the rate of fifty thousand acres a day. Three thousand Southern mills will go out of business in the next five years because they cannot get the timber to keep on. Already Southern pine is being withdrawn from many points as a competitive factor, and its place taken by Western timbers, resulting in added freight charges which the consumer pays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To be sure there is still the standing timber of Northern California, Oregon and Washington; but this, too, is going. Trees which have stood for four thousand years are being </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">cut up</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">to make fence posts, stakes for grape vines, railroad ties, etc.; and they can never be replaced. And then there are the forests on the southern shores of Alaska and the eastern shores of Siberia, the latter already in process of exploitation by American lumbermen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At present the rate of depletion of the forests is more than twice what is produced by growth in a form suitable for other purposes than firewood, and at the present rate of cutting it is estimated that when boys now ten years of age are sixty years old they will be living in a land from which all the merchantable timber has been stripped. The virgin forests of the United States have already been reduced to one-fifth of their original area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effect on Wood Industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font16">HEN the timber is cut off from a district many of the chief industries of the community perish. Factories cannot operate profitably when their raw materials must be brought from afar, and so it follows that in the wake of the lumberman there are not only idle sawmills but idle box factories, furniture factories and other wood-working establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When a region such as New England has three hundred million dollars invested in the wood and forest industries, and employs in this connection some ninety thousand wage earners, it becomes a matter of immediate interest to the whole of New England as to what is to be done when the forests are all gone. Douglas fir from the Pacific coast is already coming into the \ew England market, but nobody supposes that the New England wood industries can face modern competition and pay freight charges on raw lumber transported four thousand miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effect on Publishing Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">A</span><span class="font16">LTHOUGH the country might be just as</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• happy and just as well informed without some 'of its large publishers, yet we could not be certain that in the cramping down of the publishing business the least deserving publishers, those who have done most to mislead and deceive the people, might not find ways to continue, while the most deserving would go to the wall. In any event, if things keep on in the lumber industry the way they have been going, we hid fav tn find out what will happen; for someth mg sure to happen before very long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The United States uses one-half of the world’s supply of white paper, amounting to 5,500,000 cords of pulp-wood yearly. The woods suitable for paper manufacture are chiefly spruce, poplar and balsam firs. The newspapers of New York City alone consume the equivalent of over nine thousand spruce trees daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The consumption of print paper in the United States has increased one hundred and fifty-six percent since 1898, while the cost of print paper has increased over six hundred percent. No new paper-mills are being built. There is no use to build them; for they would not be able to find the raw materials with which to operate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is estimated that the supply of woods suitable for paper manufacture will all be cut off from the Lake States in eighteen years, and from New York and New England in seventeen years, while Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina are worse off. Some of the principal paper concerns have already fortified themselves against the day of reckoning by purchasing large blocks of timber in Canada.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Effect on Agriculture</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">TN CONSENTING to the cutting off of timber J- in the semi-arid regions of Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico, the inhabitants of those states have sinned against their own souls. The tree was and is their greatest friend, and now that it is too late some of them are beginning to find this out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Stretching his branches into the sky the tree caught the rain on leaf and twig, and carried it downward by branch and trunk, and deposited it in the sponge of decayed leaves at his feet. Slowly it trickled down into the ground, and became a fountain for the little stream which supplied the vineyard and orange grove in the valley below. He even picked up water from the fogs, as may be discerned by the wet ground beneath a tree on any foggy morning. He sheltered the vegetation from the hot winds of the desert. His value in the conservation of water, and the consequent prevention of floods, is estimated by experts as worth as much as sixty dollars per tree per year—the interest on a thousand dollars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">gar</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">cuted as vigorously as elsewhere, the result has followed that the rains which do fall, and which are the very life of the inhabitants, pass away at once in great torrents of water that have widened water courses to ten times their former width, thus not only wasting the water which the fruit grower must have if he is to continue in business, but actually destroying much arable land that until recently produced a profusion of fruits, flowers, grain and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effect Upon Navigation</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font16">E HAVE not the data at hand to write intelligently on this phase of the forest problem, but it is a serious phase of the question nevertheless. The time was when the flow of our great rivers was fairly constant, and this was due to the retention by the forests of much of the water that fell in them in the form of rain and snow. Now we are accustomed to hear of frequent great floods, and many routes of river transportation have had to suspend because the water-courses they once traversed are now so irregular in volume as to make navigation difficult or positively unsafe or impossible. Saginaw, a Michigan port once thronged with vessels, is now high and dry since the timber was cut off. The forest-denuded lands of the Adirondacks have washed down into the uppei* _ Hudson River to such an extent as to form</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">mud-flats below Albany, where only a generation ago was fairly deep water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Timber Losses by Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font16">HE loss of timber by forest fires in the United States is estimated at from twenty to one hundred million dollars annually. The area burned each year by these fires totals ten times the, devastated region of France after the World War. As the country gets more thickly settled the forest fires, instead of becoming fewer, tend to increase in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri average about seventeen thousand forest fires per year, with an average loss per fire of about four hundred dollars. Three of these states, North Carolina, Louisiana and Texas, have organized arrangements for fighting these fires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The National Government until recently expended the modest sum of two hundred thousand dollars per year on a forest fire patrol. It </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">seems -</span><span class="font16">to us a wise investment of the money; but </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">after - -</span><span class="font16">the World War, which cost the country , </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font16">. J fifty thousand million dollars, the House </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">com- / </span><span class="font16">mittee which had this matter in hand had </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a ” </span><span class="font16">sudden fit of economy and reduced the appropri- ' ation to seventy-five thousand dollars per </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">year.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">£</span></p><img src="g_E_19210119_files/g_E_19210119-6.png" alt="" style="width:61pt;height:292pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">This would hire about two dozen first-class </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">]men. ' </span><span class="font16">No wonder the Department of Agriculture </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has ' </span><span class="font16">issued a call for volunteers to report forest fires! &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Several of the states have their own forest ■ ..ire commissions. The State Conservation Com- -&gt; mission of New York has fifty-four stations for J the observation of forest fires, fifty of which are equipped with steel observation towers. During the season of 1919 these stations in the Adiron- -dacks and Catskills reported 266 forest fires the &quot;&nbsp;total damage of which was kept down to $3,825, i about fifteen dollars per fire. This shows that • forest preservation in mountainous regions is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a , ■ </span><span class="font16">possibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">HDHE fact that there is some woody growth on -*■ cut-over land gives a false impression. The <sup>f </sup>new growth is frequently slow-growing, crooked, or valueless because of its variety. Thus in <sub>t </sub>Minnesota hundreds of square miles of wonderful white and red pine, that the Almighty placed • there long ago for the use of us savages, have ' been replaced by bird-cherry and fire weed; in the South the matchless yellow pine has given place to the worthless black-jack oak; Pennsyl- _ vania’s majestic forests have been replaced by scrub oak; New England’s forests have been largely followed by inferior woods of gnarled &lt;&nbsp;and ugly shapes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">2</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font16">HEN the practice of giving away the nation’s timber lands had been found unwise, and before it was entirely gone, the Gov- r ernment reserved one hundred and fifty-five ' million acres of timber, all in the western ; mountains. These public forests are being pro- <sup>7 </sup>tected from fire, as well as can be done by the skimped appropriations; the timber is used as 'j; called for by economic conditions, and the cuL ting is conducted by such methods as to leave <sub>s </sub>the land in favorable condition for the next crop of timber. Only three percent of the country’s . jga current timber supply comes from this source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1911 the Weeks </span><span class="font16">bill, appropriating eleven </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">million </span><span class="font16">dollars for the purchase of forest lands at the head of navigable streams, became a law; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">in carrying out the provisions of this law </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">United States has come into possession of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font16">one and one-half million acres in the Eastern states—not very much when the size of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">Country is considered, but something, never</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">theless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font16">is not much chance that the Government </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font16">accomplish anything worth while in attempting to recover from its owmers the standing </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">timber now in </span><span class="font16">private hands, although bills are </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font16">up before Congress attempting something of the sort.

<p><span class="font16">The growdng of a forest is a long-time investment. Lumbermen are ufiwilling to stand the cost of planting trees which they do not expect to see come to maturity.

<p><span class="font16">Prior to the creation of the existing system of banking, before the World War, the control of credits in the United States was sporadic and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ineffective, </span><span class="font16">working in a loose way through </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">national, </span><span class="font16">state and private banking institutions.

<p><span class="font16">Evidence exists to the effect that Big Business, working through the great politicians, and with the clergy as silent accomplices, are qarry-ing out a gigantic conspiracy through the, Federal Reserve Bank system, the object of the conspiracy being to restrict the employment and consequent happiness of many of the common people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">During the World War, as a result of the larger wages earned by a considerable portion of the working people, labor began to enjoy </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">greater measure of freedom from the restraints caused by fear of unemployment. Labor grew in independence and in arrogance, as financial circumstances began to look easier. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font16">workers in great numbers effected a partial escape from economic bondage. They participated in a larger measure of enjoyment of the things making for happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Big Business termed their enjoyment of more of the good things of life “an orgy of spending”, and likened labor to “a drunken sailor” in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font16">penditures, which of course, were all right for those accustomed to abundance. Big Business became displeased at labor’s growing independence, at its increasing- “intractability”, at </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">enhanced difficulty of keeping labor “in its place”. Labor, however, being ninety percent of the population, believes that its province is to run the country, and that the under-one-percent of bankers should restrict themselves to their proper place of taking care of money entrusted to them, and not usurp the management of everything in sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Big Business long ago determined that the time was coming when it would have to “teach labor its place”. Seemingly in the pursuance of this purpose, a leading American Association of business men some months ago was reported in the public press as determined to “make labor eat out of its hand”. The ultimate object in view evidently was the preservation of Big Business’s “inalienable right” to the pursuit of happiness, which was in danger of some limitation, should the seeming abundance enjoyed by labor continue too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Following this decision, and apparently as</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">logical steps in the execution of a definite plan, the following moves have been made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There came last summer from the Federal Reserve system a sudden edict that credits were to be restricted by the local banks. This diminished the amount of capital available for use by merchants and manufacturers, who found it necessary immediately to diminish the extent of their business operations. An incident was the sudden announcement of bargain prices by stores a few months ago wherein many Golden Age readers obtained “bargains” which now would be high-priced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Farm products, never unduly high at the farm, were reduced in price in several ways. Loans to farmers promised through the much heralded Federal Farm Loan System were held up by legal action by political office-holders against the making of such loans; an impasse was reached which is not yet cleared up; and in the meantime the farmers, the most deserving class of the citizenry, have been denied the credit facilities freely granted profiteering manufacturers, miners and merchants. As a result of attacks by the Department of Justice upon the great packers to cause them to lower their prices, the prices paid farmers were cut to a ruinous extent, the farmers being unorganized and unable to protect their interests. After covering immense speculative operations in exports of farm and other products to Europe by Big Business, the domestic prices of the leading farm staples, wheat, corn and other grains and of cotton were permitted to fall to below the.cost of production, putting millions of farmers face to face with ruin, and bringing home to the farming fraternity the fact that they, too, must abstain from politics and “keep their place”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Attacks have been made upon trades-unions of miners, steel workers, and railroaders, in part through an unjustified use of a war measure, the Lever Act, to cripple their efforts to obtain higher wages and the better working conditions so badly needed, especially in the steel industry. An industrial court scheme, fathered in Kansas, which in effect enslaves the workers by tying them to their tasks, has been industriously promoted by chambers of commerce and other henchmen of Big Business, “to teach labor its place”. In innumerable instances working people have been effectually restrained from “pursuit of happiness” by such measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Assaults have been made upon Socialists and A others to render them odious, east them out </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of' </span><span class="font16">places to which they have been duly elected </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">by -</span><span class="font16">the franchise, and to prevent them from spread- -ing among the citizenry the facts about </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">current interferences with inalienable </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">human </span><span class="font16">rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The public press is being systematically </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">em</span><span class="font16">ployed to deceive the reading public, to exalt </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the -</span><span class="font16">enemies of the common weal as friends </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font16">i people, to misrepresent truth-tellers as enemies of the state, and to cause the people to fear </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font16">A despise their true friends, the purpose being to &lt;bind the minds of the multitude, the more effectively to bind their activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Legitimate business enterprises and ambition-. ” have been impeded by restricting of credit at the banks, as suggested foregoing, by hindering the transportation of material needed in manufac- w turing processes, and by sowing discord among employes to break them up into mutually suspi-clous groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Big Business and the politicians have ne- 'A glected one of the chief causes of trouble—the inflation of the currency in circulation. This, j? instead of decreasing, is steadily rising, the average per capita being $59.48 on November 1, .. 1920, as compared with $55.84 six months ago, and $54.77, $55.76, $48.76, $43.00, $38.48 and $35.50 on the first of the successive Januaries.A for a number of years back. Only as the volume' y of currency in circulation is reduced can per- A manent progress be made in reducing the cost '' of living, on the principle that when the people A as a whole have double the amount of money to <sup>_</sup>; spend they pay twice as much as before. <sub>r</sub> A;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">By these and other restraints upon the opera- -J tion of industries, the object has been attained, -and is now well under way, of throwing labor out of work in sufficient numbers to make all -&gt; feel anxious about their living, thereby render-4 ing them less independent, permitting them fo A enjoy less of the good things of life, and making - J them more “tractable”. In every part of the V country workmen have been discharged, and immediately hired back at two-thirds or even half &quot;'3 the former wage—glad to get that. It is considered good policy by Big Business to impoverish the poor still more, to force them into halftime employment and otherwise to reduce their. earnings. Months ago this sinister power said-A that it would bring about in every city bread lines and soup kitchens, knowing that the result-</span></p>

The ecclesiastics </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font16">aided the conspiracy by silence, or by advising the people to endure without attempting </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">' to </span><span class="font16">assert constitutional rights, or by denouncing </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">friends </span><span class="font16">of the people who were seeking to rouse </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">sovereign people to their danger and to cause them to seek again such a kingly independence </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font16">was expressed nearly a century and a half ago by the forebears of many of the people: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font16">men are created equal, that they are en-' dowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">pursuit </span><span class="font16">of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of ‘the governed”. To paraphrase, the true friends </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">the people, ‘appealing to the Supreme Judge </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">the world for the rectitude of our intentions, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font16">in the name of the common people, solemnly publish and declare, That the Common People </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are, </span><span class="font16">and of right ought to be, free and independent of Big Business, the Politicians, and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">ambitious Clergy; that they are absolved </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font16">all subservience to the aforesaid Unholy Trinity, and that the state of partial servitude </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to them </span><span class="font16">is and ought to lie totally dissolved; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">that as free and independent people, they </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font16">full power to do all lawful acts and things </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font16">independent people may of right do. And </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font16">support of this declaration, with a firm </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">reliance </span><span class="font16">on the protection of Divine Providence, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font16">mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font16">sacred honor.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Big Business ought to be the servant and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">handmaid of the </span><span class="font16">people, not their master, and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in this </span><span class="font16">relationship ought to operate for the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">benefit </span><span class="font16">of all the people at a reasonable profit. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">' It ought to </span><span class="font16">conduct business operations at the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">maximum </span><span class="font16">capacity possible without ever need</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">lessly </span><span class="font16">restricting them. The public press ought </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to become, not </span><span class="font16">agencies for blinding the people, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font16">N-E-w-s-papers. The politicians ought to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">serve the best </span><span class="font16">interests of all the people. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">dergy ought </span><span class="font16">to give up the impossible attempt to serve God and Mammon, and serve </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him </span><span class="font16">alone unto whom they are set apart, comforting the hearts of the people, guiding them with </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">Word of God, minding spiritual things and avoiding the earthly and fieshly things </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font16">pollute their holy office and drag </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">them down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Otherwise the divine pronouncement that was made to the Hebrew people and church will apply to the Christian people and their churches. It is not too late, but haste must be made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Behold, as the elay is in the potter’s </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">hand, so </span><span class="font16">are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel [ Christian people of America].- At what </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">instant I </span><span class="font16">shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom<sup>-</sup>, to pluck up, and to pull down,-</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">to. destroy it: if that nation, against </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">whom I </span><span class="font16">have pronounced, turn from their evil, I </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font16">repei 1 i. of the evil that I thought to do unto </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">them. </span><span class="font16">And at what instant I shall speak concerning </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font16">wherewith I said I would benefit them. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Now </span><span class="font16">therefore go to, speak to the men of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Judah </span><span class="font16">[Christian people], and to the inhabitants </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">Jerusalem [adherents of the Unholy Trinity], saying, Thus saith the Lord: Behold I frame evil against you, and devise </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">device </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">against </span><span class="font16">you: return ye now every one from his evil </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">way, </span><span class="font16">and make your ways and your doings good. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font16">they said, There is no hope [of our changing]: but we will walk after our own devices, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and we. </span><span class="font16">will every one do the imagination of his evil lieart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If “Christian” America through its leadership in the Unholy Trinity answers the divine appeal in the foregoing manner, then the words of the Lord for them will be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Because my people hath forsaken me, they' have burned incense [put forth their best endeavors] to vanity [things of no eternal worth] <sub>% </sub>and they have caused them [the trusting common people] to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths [such godly paths as the early Americans took], to walk in paths [like war, profiteering, and oppression], in a way not cast up [not high and noble]; to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing; everyone that passeth thereby [in memory of it] shall be astonished, and wag his head. I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back and not the face [favor] in the day of their calamity.”—Jeremiah 18: 6 -17.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Big Brother Bosses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font25">A</span><span class="font16"> WONDERFUL movement—seemingly—is spreading among American employers. In their relations with workers they are no longer to be the “cruel taskmaster”, but the Big Brother. After the wage-scale has been suitably depressed through recent credit restrictions and the hard times engineered through the Federal Reserve Bank system, the worker is to be made to appreciate that his boss is really his long-lost brother and that harmony is to reign in the industrial family. No more exactions from people “over” the worker, no more driving by unsympathetic foremen, no more discourtesy, no longer the lack of consideration for human welfare that has marked the industrial past; but it is to be as man to man, as Christian to Christian, if you please, and all is to be on the upgrade toward heaven on earth—except that wages are no longer to be unduly raised, the sad past having been buried, the hatchet entombed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So read the new proposals of employers to workers, in confidential booklets “just between us”, wherein a new gold-plated proposition is set before the workers. In every concern, under the imminent dove-like Republican administration of affairs — which has just had the ground cleared by lowering prices, days’ work per week, and wages and by “reducing” workers in one of the most cruel though artificial spells of hard times known in the country —a Company Plan is to be submitted in the interests of peace and harmony, “law and order”, and so on. Under this plan an “association” of employes is to be organized. It is to have many attractive features—insurance, cafeterias, pensions, hot coffee, smoking rooms, rest rooms, employes’ monthly journal, tennis court, annual workers’ picnic, plant hospital, company doctor, maybe a corporation priest and pastor—though this is not mentioned—the right to be “heard” in differences over w’ages or working conditions, and some of the other “welfare” sugar-coating, that in not a few plants the workers have long paid for out of the difference between their pay and the wage they should have had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The great employers say, “We must have satisfied employes”. They claim to be willing, nay anxious, to pay “a fair wage for a fair day’s work”. They aver that they desire to “do” their</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">workers good. Their speech is to the effect that they intend to rectify all “real” grievances the 5' employes may have. They profess willingness -to let their “help” have the “privilege” of col- &quot;. lective bargaining over wages and working conditions. They say that always in the past they have been fair and square with the workers. They &gt;&nbsp;are glad now to have their people organize into - \ an association limited to the one plant or con- vs cern. Where there are laws governing wages j and working conditions the employers state that -- ? they desire to observe and keep the laws in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">-Jj fair and above-board spirit. They say they are willing for any employe to continue his membership in any union, but of course prefer him </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">be in the local association. They announce that they will do nothing to coerce, intimidate </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font16">compel any worker to join the company associa- S tion, or to give up union membership. They are “magnanimous”, and will subject no one to evil or harmful influences for his attitude toward the Big Brother proposition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Inasmuch as when men apply for work, they 4 are judged not by what they say they can and J will do, but by what they have done, so it is but ■ fair to place in the balance the employers’ past, . v their deeds in this connection, and their present .3 promises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;A</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In many instances employes have not been permitted to read or to take with them for care- A. ful consideration the company booklet on the i Big Brother scheme, being expected to be satis- • tied with oral statements. Employes complain that they have been browbeaten and intimidated . by petty officials. They have been threatened with evil in a variety of ways if they did not “go ~&quot;<sub>t </sub>along”. Employers have for years back tenaci- f ously fought employes in any attempt by the latter to improve wages and working conditions. They have ignored the wishes of workers. They have positively refused to confer with them on 'A differences affecting such matters. They have pronounced fair innumerable schemes which the workers have declared unfair. When laws existed governing the settlement of disputes they a| have ignored important provisions of the laws. When decisions and interpretations have been </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">vjg </span><span class="font16">issued they have twisted these into something far different from either the spirit or the letter. They have failed to keep former promises. They tSj</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font16">gone counter to the tyings of boards of have always sought to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">destroy them, and </span><span class="font16">to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this </span><span class="font16">arbitration and other agencies designed to in- end have employed every </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">conceivable means, </span><span class="font16">sure fair play. They have crushed former at- Lately they have attacked </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">unions </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font16">tempts of employes to organize or have sought the United States </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Department of Justice and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">unsuccessfully to crush existing organizations in the making. They have kept paid agents and other spies in existing organizations. They have caused their spies to rise to prominent positions in union circles. They have bribed union officials to induce employes who would have won to accept terms insuring ultimate defeat. They have prevented the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech, press and assemblage. They have “framed up” union leaders </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">sent the innocent to prison. They have suborned witnesses and paid for perjury which convicted innocent men of even murder. They have corrupted judges, legislatures and public executives to act against poor working </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">All these things, and many more, have been </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">done by </span><span class="font16">employers in connection with their deal</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ings </span><span class="font16">with the workers. Not all employers have </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">done </span><span class="font16">all these things, and some have done none </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">them, but only a few have repudiated the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">evil </span><span class="font16">acts of other employers. It is the same men that have thus conducted themselves and are now coming for ward with the Big Brother offer. They that have lied in the past will now tell the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">truth. They </span><span class="font16">that have dealt dishonestly will now be above-board. The deceitful are become truthtellers. The unfair are honorable. Persecutors have turned benefactors. Law breakers </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font16">suddenly filled with law and order. Wolves </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font16">lambs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Practically all the advancement made by Workers in wages and conditions of work have come through the trades-unions. Bitter experi</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ence </span><span class="font16">has taught unfair employers that combat with national unions may result disastrously. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Inch by </span><span class="font16">inch the unions have raised their mem</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">bers out of </span><span class="font16">the slough of low pay, up to the high place held by American workers. Employers who have kept unorganized employes beaten </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font16">to earth, have had to grant improvements in pay to the same workers when organized in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">national </span><span class="font16">unions—pay that has meant well-being </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">happiness, thrift and comfort to hundreds </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">thousands of homes. In some instances, this power has been perverted by lawless union leaders, which is wrong, but not more so than </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the lawlessness of unfair employers. Employers dislike and often dread the great unions. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">through state officials, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and paralyzed some of </span><span class="font16">the efforts by working </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">men to improve their </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Ji </span><span class="font16">pay. They have </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">sought the destruction of </span><span class="font16">unions generally by bringing </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">on hard times, with Y </span><span class="font16">the thought that when tens of thousands of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">men ■ </span><span class="font16">are out of work, it will be easy to bring </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font16">the power of the workers in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">order </span><span class="font16">the further </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to £ </span><span class="font16">establish their own. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">They believe that they can </span><span class="font16">-L&lt; beguile some workers by </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a show of beneficence; </span><span class="font16">&quot;J and in order to catch them and weaken </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">morale of the unions generally, the employers y come forward smilingly </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">with the Big Brother . </span><span class="font16">proposition in one </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">hand, and in the other, </span><span class="font16">behind the back, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a dagger for the national &nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">unions. There may </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">be some prospect of the ■ ?-<sup>s </sup></span><span class="font16">Big Brother scheme finding </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">acceptance </span><span class="font16">in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">some &nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">concerns. Perhaps many </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">may take it </span><span class="font16">up. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">At &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">least it may be expected </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that a more or </span><span class="font16">less general offering of this proposition may </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">bp </span><span class="font16">J made throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Such a move on the part of Big Business is ? not without precedent; even in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible </span><span class="font16">times </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font16">is recorded such an incident </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">with its outcome: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">tp</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Undoubtedly the Big Brother idea is much closer to the Golden Rule than former methods and is what ought to prevail in every industry from president and directors down. If it were made in good faith, it ought to succeed; but being made by men with such a record as many of the large employers have, the outcome will be the same as with the ancient “Big Brothers” of Jeremiah’s day. If the present movement rang true and were “100 percent American”, all wool and a yard wide, no doubt many troubles that are surely coming might be averted. But because the men back of the movement know better, the Big Brother plan will bring them only the greater disfavor from God when it is dropped, and the words that God spoke through the old prophet 2,500 years ago will apply again in the modern replica of ancient history:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel [of Christendom too, professedly]: I made a covenant with your fathers . . . saying, At the eud </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">seven years let ye go every man his brother </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font16">Hebrew [today, a fellow Christian], which hath been sold unto thee [by the existing economic system]; . . . but your fathers [employ</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ers </span><span class="font16">of the past] hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear [employers used to work poor people sixteen hours a day regularly]. And ye were now turned [in the Big Brother movement]’ and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty [economic] every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a [Big Brother] covenant before me in the house [the churches] which is called by my name [Christian]. But ye turned and polluted my name [by dropping a kindly arrangement entered into in God’s name] and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty, at their pleasure [if they wanted to make the arrangement], to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and handmaids. Therefore thus saith Jehovah [and He says it again today] : Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence [now raging in Europe], and to the famine [made inevitable through unfair treatment of American farmers].”—Jeremiah 34:12 -17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">M</span><span class="font16">OST human beings cause considerable excitement twice in their lives, once when </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">they arrive and </span><span class="font16">once when they leave. Nowa</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">days many </span><span class="font16">of them arrive in hospitals, and this </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">plan </span><span class="font16">has much to commend it. However, there </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are some </span><span class="font16">disadvantages also; and one of these • is that where there are so many youngsters all of one size they occasionally get mixed. Some</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">times </span><span class="font16">the tags come off, and in the general </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">mixup </span><span class="font16">it is not always certain which baby </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">■ belongs </span><span class="font16">to whom. It is feared by those who </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">know that </span><span class="font16">sometimes young mothers have </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">carried away </span><span class="font16">from hospitals babies which they </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">prized </span><span class="font16">highly, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font16">which did not really belong to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In some hospitals the nurses are required to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">keep a </span><span class="font16">strip of surgeon’s plaster on the back of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font16">baby, with its name written thereon. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A new </span><span class="font16">plan has been suggested, proposing the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">compulsory </span><span class="font16">recording of the finger prints of all </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">babies as soon </span><span class="font16">as possible after they are born. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">There seems to be </span><span class="font16">no objection to this. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">finger prints </span><span class="font16">of every human being differ from those of every other, and these finger prints </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">never </span><span class="font16">change, but remain the same </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">from the cradle to the </span><span class="font16">grave. It is pointed out that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">if a finger </span><span class="font16">print of Charlie Ross had been taken at </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">his birth he </span><span class="font16">would probably have been identified </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in later life, and </span><span class="font16">that if finger printing were </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">general </span><span class="font16">there would be no cases of persons lost </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font16">lapse of memory. It is said that in one </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">year </span><span class="font16">recently sixty persons classed as unidenti-</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">. fied dead </span><span class="font16">were identified by finger prints.</span></p>

In </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">United States, during 1919, the decrease in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">mortality </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">children in the largest cities, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">over previous </span><span class="font16">years, ranged from 8 percent </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to -• 24 </span><span class="font16">percent. This was due, in part, to the fact </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font16">there was almost no unemployment in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">country </span><span class="font16">during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Desperate </span><span class="font16">efforts are being made to save as </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">many as </span><span class="font16">possible of the children of Europe, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">especially the new </span><span class="font16">babies, it being </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">understood that for </span><span class="font16">many of those born during the war </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">there is little hope that they can be made into</span></p>

This </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Bureati. </span><span class="font16">gives special protection to children </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">born out of </span><span class="font16">wedlock, of whom there have always been great numbers in “Apostolic” Vienna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The condition of the children of Eastern Europe is so pathetic that when Harry Perel-stein, a furrier of New York, visited the Ukrainian district as a member of the American relief expedition, he brought home with him, as permanent members of his family, nine little orphans that he did not have the heart to leave. God bless Harry Perelstein for his nobility </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">heart! Mrs. Perelstein must not be forgotten, either; for much of the burden of the care of . this brood will fall upon her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Reverting again to the condition of children in hospitals, there seems to be abundant evidence that in most cases of acute sickness the children are better off in a hospital than elsewhere, because the hospital possesses the necessary nursing skill and appliances to care for really sick babies. But as soon as an infant or young child is convalescent, almost any other place is better than a hospital.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">E</span><span class="font16">XPERIENCE has proven that an institution is the very worst place for children. Those who know the most about institutions, and who give their experience in the medical magazines, point out that in these institutions it is almost certain that infants and young children will be inadequately fed and that they will be subjected to repeated attacks of infectious diseases which they, of all children, are least able to withstand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The statistics bear out these conclusions. In the State of New York it was found that during four years the death rate of infants under two years of age, throughout the state, was only one-fifth that of the State institutions included in the same areas. Moreover, about one-half of all the children under two years of age that are discharged from the institutions of New York State go out as corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Of 14,525 children under two years of age</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">‘discharged from the institutions of the State of New York during the years 1914 to 1918, the number that went out as corpses was 6,583; and out of a total of 12,437 of these children that Were discharged, within one year from the time they were received at the institutions, 6,503 went Out as corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Foster-Mother Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">N</span><span class="font16">OBLE-MINDED physicians who have made experiments on a large scale have proven that the best place to put an ailing child, one that is not downright sick with an acute attack of some disease, is in the arms of a mother; or, if the little one has no real mother, then in the arms of somebody who has the true motherly spirit, a foster-mother. It has been found that personal loving attention has a therapeutic value, and that it does babies good to be handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Experience in the boarding out of children in selected districts of Yonkers and Morristown (suburbs of New York city) has shown that if </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">woman has motherly instincts and fairly healthy children of her own, children will thrive better in her care, even if there is a certain amount of dirt and disorder about, than they will in hospitals or the homes of immaculate housekeepers who are unmotherly. There is no substitute for love in the life of a child, or in the life of a grown person, for that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is a certain class of infants that when placed in institutions results in 100 percent of deaths. These are what are known as “chronic cases of extreme atrophy” (a wasting condition). When boarding places for these children were found with good motherly foster-mothers it was found that forty-six percent were saved. These foster-mothers have been paid $18 per month per baby, plus the cost of the best milk, though higher prices are anticipated hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Child Health and Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">I</span><span class="font16">N ORDER to get along in the complex life of modern civilization children must be educated, and yet no amount of education can compensate for the loss of a child’s health. It is a great problem to know how to deal with the undernourished children of whom we now have ip the United States many millions. It is impossible for an undernourished child to concentrate on his studies for even a few minutes without fatigue, and as soon as a child exhibits symptoms of tension and over-fatigue his school hours should be reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It would be highly desirable if all the undernourished could be cared for by private tutors, who would regulate their educational loads individually, but unfortunately these are the very ones whose parents cannot afford to send them to tutors. They must be educated in the public schools or not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Under the circumstances, the best arrangement for such children is to have them sent home at the morning recess, and to require them to take rest and refreshment before returning for the afternoon session. Long sessions are very harmful to such children, putting drains upon their constitutions which they cannot meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not infrequently it happens that a child that is undernourished, and therefore does not </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">get on</span><span class="font16"> in school, accomplishes more in a half day in school than when required to attend for a full day. In an instance mentioned by an investigator of this subject it was noted that when the child went to school a full day he made no gain in weight, but when his school session was made a half day he gained two pounds in three weeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font16">HE boys and girls of New York city have to play in the streets, because there is no other place for most of them to play. In recognition 5? of this a very fine arrangement has been made, effective during the summer season, of closing sections of certain streets to vehicular traffic &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">between the hours of 3 and 8 P. M., and during &nbsp;&nbsp;J?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The fact that a boy has to play in the streets does not mean that he is a bad boy. The Sage Foundation found this out not long ago.

<p><span class="font16">- The New York State Industrial Commission ■ reports finding in White Plains, a suburb of New York city, during the summer of 1920, scores of children from 4 to 13 years of age, who should have been playing in the open air, engaged—in the interest of wealthy chatelaine manufacturers—in the work of stringing beads at four cents per thousand beads. The work is tedious, involving eye strain, and yields the little workers only about $2 per week for a full week’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The District of Columbia has no truancy law; and statistics show that of the 55,000 children in the District only 43,000 are attending school.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">England in Time of Stress</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Robert Barham (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Mr:. </span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Editoi:: Things are gradually working to ' a head in England. The efforts of the capitalist press to weaken the power and influence of labor by the Bolshevist alarms still sway the majority of the professional and commercial classes to support the Government, but the ranks of the labor party and the tradesunions are rapidly increasing in numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The London Town Council has decided that at • all the Council's affairs, such as band performances in the park, etc., the “Red Flag”, the Socialist song, shall be substituted for the British national anthem. This same municipal authority has taken other drastic steps. It </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font16">sanctioned the permission of Sunday games in the Council’s parks, and ordered that all employes must become trades-unionists or </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">leave </span><span class="font16">their employment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>J</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the heated debates at the London </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Town and </span><span class="font16">Borough Councils on the matter of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday </span><span class="font16">games, it became apparent that the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">average </span><span class="font16">labor man is losing all faith in religion and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font16">fessed churchianity. Religion is being weighed according to the attitude of its professors; and . the attitude of the clergy during the war, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">the consistency of that attitude with their profession, is a hard problem for the average </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font16">to harmonize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The fact that the seas and waves are </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">roaring </span><span class="font16">with discontent and anger against the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“powers </span><span class="font16">that be” has never been so keenly felt in England as in the past few months, and the British Government is fast losing all the confidence ' that was once placed in it by the people. Since the last general election the Government </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font16">lost ten seats, and a huge proportion of munici-pal bodies now have labor majorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The attitude of the churches in all this, with some remarkable exceptions, is distinctly </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">with ■ </span><span class="font16">the Government and capitalist interests. One </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">01 </span><span class="font16">the exceptions is in a South-Eastern </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">London'. </span><span class="font16">Baptist church, where the minister is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a con</span><span class="font16">fessed Bolshevist, and his congregations </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font16">Sunday are probably the largest in South-East London, if not in London. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The eyes, “the windows of the soul,” are the most delicately responsive centers of perception '—inquiring, inviting, retiring, inciting. If there </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font16">“nobody home” inside there will be no lights </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font16">the windows. No one has lived very long who </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">does </span><span class="font16">not know the power of<sup>v</sup>a single glance to ravish the senses of a whole roomful of people. Yellow is the color of wisdom, and yellow in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">normal </span><span class="font16">coloring of the eye </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font16">from time immemorial been recognized as indicative of sagac</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ity, </span><span class="font16">astuteness, acumen. As a matter of course, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">there are no </span><span class="font16">wholly yellow eyes, but it will </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">be borne in </span><span class="font16">mind that yellow is one of the principal constitutents of brown and hazel. Furthermore, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font16">is often observed in a gray eye that yellowish rays emanate as from the pupil toward the circumference of the iris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A “blue nose” is a symbol of austerity, with perhaps a prud</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ish </span><span class="font16">tinge. Both of these qualities are but perversions of jus- 3 </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">tice—</span><span class="font16">lines of conduct wherein </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">A</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">eyes, is not without signifi- £ <sup>s </sup>cance. The small-nosed man</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">cannot have a judicial mind, whatever his other excellencies may be. And a man whose nose upturns can no more be expected to administer justice than a pug dog can be expected to act as </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Ruby lips” need no introduction as the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">stronghold of love, </span><span class="font16">the fortress of sensuous perception. Their covering merges from the epidermal tissue of the outer body to the epithelial lining of the inner organism; and on this rosy frontier more of the world’s history than </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font16">suspected has been fraught. The thick lip is the sensual lip; the large mouth is the generous mouth. The small mouth knows no love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Now comes the black ear! What maternal solicitude has been directed to its eradication, and here it is justifying its existence as the base of power. It occupies a position about equally distant from the three other poles. But whatever its color, its size and position and setting are certainly indicative of force. The orifice of the ear in the fully balanced man is said to be in the geometric center of the profile head.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">C</span><span class="font16">ASTE lines in pagan India are not more inexorable than those separating the American goats from the sheep—the farm-hand from his “betters”—in many sections of the country. For the city has nothing on the rural districts when it comes to “society”. The farms and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">country villages of so-called “Christian” </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Amer</span><span class="font16">ica boast their “four hundreds”, the elite of farmerdom; and the farm-hand has no </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">place in </span><span class="font16">these charmed circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many a husky city man has bethought </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font16">that in “the freedom of fields and forests” he would find rest for his soul, and has hied him, with his unsuspecting wife, away from factory and flat to take a job as a farm-hand. What did the hopeful couple encounter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Socialdom is woman’s sphere </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">even in the </span><span class="font16">country; and the farm-hand’s wife </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">may look </span><span class="font16">from without in, but may not enter. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font16">works, and “the woman pays”. If an </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">attack of </span><span class="font16">the “back-to-the-farm fever” gets a </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">city man </span><span class="font16">able to buy a farm, he and his wife </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">may find </span><span class="font16">some social joy; but over the farm-hand’s place hangs a sign, “Abandon hope all ye who </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">enter </span><span class="font16">here”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sixty dollars a month with “cottage” and garden thrown in looks good to many a young couple tired of the grind of factory and a home as a city cave-dweller. The youth “hires out”, and comes to a “home”, with the windows half out, dilapidated paper on the walls, a leaky roof, a dry well and a tangle of weeds for </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">“garden”. It is woman’s work to tidy things up, while “hubby” works from 5:30 a. m. to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">8:00 </span><span class="font16">p. m.; and the ambitious graduate of a city school system gets the thing done somehow* Training in household economics and practice for a few years ever a city gas-range has made a proficient laeusewife, but the neighbor’s children may not rua in for a cooky or a story without risk of a “licking” at home for wandering over the forbidden social threshold. In education and connections both farm-hand and wife may be the equals of any one, but not in the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The itinerant butcher on the weekly round condescends not to turn in to the farm-hand’s humble home, but demonstrates his superiority by driving past. Hence no fresh meat to keep up needed strength, except by a tramp to the neighboring village. The farm-owner somehow had a bad memory about getting anything “in town” for the “hand”, except once when he acted </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font16">though it were a humiliation, after which his comings and goings were known only when finished. The furniture might come to the five-mile-away station and the first lot be teamed in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font16">the farmer, but never again; and though horses and wagons might be out of use for halfdays at a time, the second load would have to be trucked out to the “cottage”. Garden tools were lying about, but the farm-hand must buy his own. There were plenty of seeds for a garden, but none for the farm-hand’s garden. Without a cow skim milk would have been a boon, but it was fed to the hogs. Fruit rotting on the ground would have meant so much. The long tramps </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">the store seemed needless, with the farm horses idle and the Ford in its shed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">City work has its Sunday rest, but no such relief for the farm worker. Church in the country is for the elect alone. If the “hand” did not have to do some heavy work, there was plenty of odds and ends to be done on days when the farmer and his family went to some outing. An almost universal social aloofness characterized the attitude of farm-owners and their folks toward the farm-hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Is it any wonder that on so many farms the work is being carried on by old men, undesirables, loafers and semi-tramps? The self-respecting, able-bodied and able-brained youth and his wife—the equal of any of “the people” ■—get tired of being social and economic lepers. They hie them to the better conditions of the city and factory; the farm has one less “hand”; and the food problem advances a tiny step toward the inevitable crisis.</span></p>

Without coal much of America would be uninhabitable in winter; its scarcity is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">great hardship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The per capita use of coal rose from .2 ton in 1850 to 3.55 tons in 1900 and 6.44 tons in 1918, ’’ and a slightly larger figure in 1920. Including all coal used for every purpose the amount in ' pounds for each person in 1918 was:</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The amount of coal in 1919 was: anthracite, 86,200,000 tons, bituminous, 458,063,000 tons. In 1917, when the anthracite production was 82,500,000 tons, it was used—for domestic purposes, 50,000,000 tons, for industrial uses, 20,000,000 tons, for railroads, 6,500,000 tons and-for export 6,000,000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There are plenty of mines, an abundance of coal ready for mining, and more than enough coal miners to extract the coal. The chief causes of scarcity of coal are the low pay of the miners —95 cents a tori in anthracite fields—and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">shortage of railroad cars to load with coal </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">carry it to market.

Besides, if more coal were mined, the price would fall, and less than the present $19.00 </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">would be </span><span class="font16">distributable. If any of them are profiteering, a profiteer is very hard to find, and still harder to convict of violation of more than the moral law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The supplying of railroad cars enough is not </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font16">immediate possibility, because it takes time </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">build cars sufficient even to transport the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">existing 10 </span><span class="font16">percent shortage of coal. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">number </span><span class="font16">of new cars needed is estimated at </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">100,000, </span><span class="font16">to build which would be a formidable task for the car builders to attempt offhand, with other business to be taken care of. One might imagine that when times are as hard as</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">at present .and so many men out of work, it . ■ would be possible for the. railroad equipment concerns that make cars to provide work for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">’ -unemployed..But that is not possible in a condi' tion of falling prices; for cars are not built merely to be used,.but to make a profit on. The required cars cannot be undertaken until times grow very hard and prices reach the bottom. As soon ‘ as that happens, cars can be made at a profit . until the next period of declining prices. Mean-&lt; while the coal shortage continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is suggested by mechanical engineers that in _ stationary-engine plants, using 30.8 percent of the coal, 25 percent of the coal is wasted up the chimney, and that proper training of firemen would save enough to make up half of the 10 - percent scarcity of coal—this if only 20 percent ' to 23 percent of the wasted coal were saved at ' the grate. So colleges are providing extension ' courses to teach firemen how to save coal; they <sub>L</sub>. are reaching perhaps one or two percent of the coal wasters in the industrial field. Employers </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">■ are </span><span class="font16">reaching more coal users; and perhaps - something may be done immediately in keeping j waste down, though this seems scarcely neces</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">sary </span><span class="font16">when.so many plants are closing down and not using coal, a process which alone should make up much more than the shortage.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">It is a very poor way to save coal—to shut down &quot;half the plants and put half the men out' of work; but it is obvious, too, that men opt of work cannot buy as much coal as men at work, which will save considerable coal for those </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font16">may retain their jobs. Housewives need no further incentive to be thrifty than the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">$20.00 </span><span class="font16">price, but few of them know how to apply fuelsaving methods in kitchen practice. As they use 16.8 percent of the coal, missionary work among them might save a little. The railroads, which burn 25.2 percent of the coal, have always been fighting the coal waste problem, but the locomotive is naturally so wasteful a steam-plant that not a great deal can be accomplished in that direction. If exports were shut off by an embargo, it would save half the shortage; but such action would accentuate the foreign trade problem, lose good foreign customers and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font16">more harm than it would help. Very </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">possibly </span><span class="font16">that supreme conserver, the Federal Fuel </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Ad</span><span class="font16">ministrator, may step in and reduce the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">coal </span><span class="font16">business to a wartime basis, as the only feasible immediate solution of our present difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A sun engine that seems to us to give better _ promise is that invented by Honore Wiltsie, editor of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Delineator,</span><span class="font16"> who has made use of ” the principle that sulphur dioxide steams at </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a 78 </span><span class="font16">low temperature and may be caused to do so by the heat imparted by hot water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In Mr. Wiltsie’s engine the water is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">heated by </span><span class="font16">being caused to run down inclined panes </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">glass, under glass covers which are exposed to the rays of the sun.

<p><span class="font16">This arrangement of Mr. Wiltsie’s produces results. It pumps the sulphur dioxide and the hot water back to the starting point, so that nothing is wasted, and runs day and night fur- -nishing all the light and power needed at the Arizona ranch where it is in operation. It is enabled to run at night because the water heated , ' by the sun remains hot throughout the night, ’3g sufficiently hot to cause the dioxide to steam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yig</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Another methed which it is hoped to utilize in obtaining power from the sun is to convert the sun’s heat directly into electricity by the use of what is called the thermopile. It is well known that when several sheets of metal of different kinds are connected together and heat is applied to one or more of the sheets, but not to the others, an electric current is generated. We have not yet heard of any practical applications of this principle, but it is reported that a Philadelphia engineer is giving the matter attention and may produce something worth while along this line in the near future.</span></p>

The heat is obtained by boring holes in the earth’s crust, in volcanic regions. Although the plant at Lardarello has been utilized to generate power by means of turbines, it is said to be objectionable for this purpose because it contains sulphuric acid and other substances which corrode metals, especially iron. Another deep hole is being sunk near Naples in the hope of obtaining a supply of power for factories in that district.</span></p>

This is a message of some ” ' hope to the automobilist, who sees gasoline mounting higher and higher. Dispatches from Webster City, Iowa, state that Arthur Bundy of that city has compounded certain chemicals, -which are inexpensive and all about us everywhere, by means of which the oxygen of the air is used for power, and that by means of this power, without a cent’s worth of oil or gas, he • drove an Overland truck about the city all day at a total expense of five cents; and that, moreover, the chemicals used are not explosive and a child may drink them without injury.

<p><span class="font16">The little machine lit an ordinary incandescent lamp to a ruby glow, yielding for a long time an uninterrupted flow of at least eighty, volts, and Hubbard claims it would have done this continuously until the insulating material on the wires decayed or the wires rusted off at the terminals. The whole machine is only a little larger than a cigar box and weighs but twelve pounds. The polarity changes at the rate of one hundred and twenty times a second. When connected to a twenty-five horse-power motor the apparatus caused it to jump into life, developing its full capacity and power. An investigation of the work of the machine was made in the presence of a number of Seattle</span></p>

The Italian engineer estimated that, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">unit </span><span class="font16">for unit, power can be delivered in Italy in this way for a little less than half of the cost </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">transporting the coal itself. An English </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font16">pany has been set up in South Africa to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">carry </span><span class="font16">power a like distance from the falls of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">Zambesi.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">By measuring the heat given off by a small quantity it is estimated that one gram of radium, if its energy could be liberated at once, contains as much power as would be derived </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font16">the burning of three million tons of coal </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">its conversion by the usual methods into electrical energy.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ALESTINE </span><span class="font16">is designated in the Scriptures as ‘'God’s land”. In that land God has staged the greater part of His wonderful drama looking to the redemption’ and restoration of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">_ Egypt lies adjacent to Palestine. In Biblical symbology Egypt represents the world of mankind under the dominion of Satan, “the god of fliis world”. (Hosea 11:1; 2 Corinthians 4:4) ■ We should expect, therefore, to find in Egypt many things which represent Satan and his works. Other Scriptures and the physical facts show that Satan has attempted to counterfeit every feature of the divine plan; and some of these evidences appear in Egypt to a marked degree, but these have been little understood by the world in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Cairo, the capital city of Egypt, is built practically upon the site of the home of the ancient Pharaohs. This city and the land about it have been the scene of much history-making of interest to Christians and non-Christians. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font16">philosophers of the world search the ruins </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">the monuments of Egypt for relics, and marvel and expatiate upon the greatness of prehistoric man, who produced them. The Christian, in the light of divine prophecy as now revealed, looks upon Egypt, its ruins and monuments, from a far different viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Christian marks that in this land Abraham sojourned for a time; that in Egypt God caused Jacob and his children to reside for a i much longer period and finally delivered them out of th» land of their oppressors by the hand of Moses; that Joseph, one of the sons of Jacob, there filled a great office next to the king, and by his wisdom and ingenuity saved the people dur. ing a time of great famine; that into this land Jehovah sent the babe Jesus and out from this land called Him in due time; and that all these </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">events </span><span class="font16">foreshadowed the coming of other events </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">far greater importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Great numbers of searchers for information visit Egypt and are always invited by the residents to view the ruins, the temples, the pyramids and the museum; but the one object of Egypt that is of such great interest to the Christian, and that short!}’ will have increased interest for the peoples of the world in general, / is the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. And why is this so? Because the prophet of God made; a record of this pyramid as being a mighty witness, first to the Christians and later to all the peoples of the world. Even many who claim to be Christians have overlooked the fact that the prophet Isaiah says: “In that day there -shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the; oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them. And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. And the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.”—Isaiah 19:19- 22. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This prophecy, in its relation to Egypt, has a two-fold fulfillment. The altar of the Lord here mentioned is the Great Pyramid, builded in the literal land of Egypt. Egypt, as already stated, symbolically means the world of mankind. The prophecy shows that a time would come when the Lord and His plan shall be known in Egypt and that “the Egyptians shall know the Lord ih that day”. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;In that day”</span><span class="font16"> doubtless means the day of the Messianic reign, which '/ill begin with the passing of the old order. The old world, or old social order, began to end in 1914 j and is rapidly passing away, and the Lord has taken unto Himself His great power and now ' reigns. (Matthew 24: 3 -14; Revelation 11:17, 18) Since we have come, therefore, to the beginning of &quot;’!■ U day”, it is quite appropriate, to call attention to this Great Pyramid, with the expectation that the peoples of earth will now begin to find a deep interest in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some members of our party had visited the Great Pyramid on former occasions, and some had not before seen it; but all were anxious to examine it. Several days were spent viewing the outside and the inside of this wonderful structure, and pictures were made from different viewpoints, both outside and inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is a number of other pyramids in the vicinity of Cairo and along the Nile; but it is</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">the Great Pyramid of Gizeh that is referred to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font16">the prophet in the language above quoted. This pyramid is located on an elevation over</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">looking the </span><span class="font16">Nile, and is situated between eight </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and ten </span><span class="font16">miles southwest of the present city of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Cairo. It </span><span class="font16">is interesting to note that the delta </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">the Nile forms a seacoast in the shape of a </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">true </span><span class="font16">quarter-circle, with the Great Pyramid situated exactly in the center of that circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In 1868 Mr. Mitchell, who was making a coast survey for the United States, discovered the location of the Great Pyramid in this fanshaped delta. He said: “That stone witness is in a more important physical situation than any other building erected by man”. The above prophecy of Isaiah corroborates this statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The measurements of the Great Pyramid fix the date of its construction. Professor C. Piazzi Smyth, by astronomical calculations, together with the other measurements, demonstrates that the Great Pyramid was built in the year 2170 </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C., </span><span class="font16">at which time the Dragon star (which is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">symbol of evil) was exactly in line with the descending passage of the Pyramid. The inference drawn from this is that the downward passage pictures the course of mankind in sin, under the dominion of Satan, the prince of the power of the air, the god of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Great Pyramid covers an area of approximately thirteen acres. It is 764 feet broad at its base, and 486 feet high. Its estimated weight is six million tons: and to move it would require six thousand locomotives, each drawing a thousand tons. There are stones in the structure thirty feet in length, weighing approximately 880 tons; find although no mortar was used in laying these stones, their surfaces fit together so closely that the place of union can scarcely be discerned. It is certainly the most remarkable building in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Taking into consideration the </span><span class="font14">nature </span><span class="font16">of its construction and the material used, many have wondered how these great blocks of </span><span class="font14">stone were </span><span class="font16">laid into place. There is no record </span><span class="font14">that at the </span><span class="font16">time it was built there was any </span><span class="font14">powerful ma</span><span class="font16">chinery for lifting these stones. From the physical facts about the Pyramid I make the following suggestion as to </span><span class="font14">how those stones </span><span class="font16">were placed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After the first course of </span><span class="font14">stones was laid </span><span class="font16">011 </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">solid rock foundation, the sand could have </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font16">piled up even with the top of that course and another course of stones put in place, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">then the sand piled up even </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">with that course. </span><span class="font16">Skids laid on the sand </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">would serve as a means </span><span class="font16">for drawing these great stones up. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">And this \ </span><span class="font16">process of piling up the sand and drawing </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">up -</span><span class="font16">the stones on skids, being continued, would &lt;&nbsp;' ultimately bring the builders to the top. The great mass of sand and debris around about the ' Pyramid seems to corroborate this view; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and '' </span><span class="font16">we should find some reasonable way in which the structure was erected. While Christians </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are . '</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">fully convinced that it was constructed </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">under </span><span class="font16">the supervision of Jehovah, it is preferable </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font16">believe that the Almighty would employ </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">natural </span><span class="font16">means for its erection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That we have reached the end of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">old </span><span class="font16">world and the beginning of the new there can be absolutely no doubt. This journal has heretofore published much proof on this </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">point.. </span><span class="font16">That God has a well appointed plan which </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font16">is performing in His own good way there </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font16">also be no doubt; and He promised that this plan would be made known unto man in His due time. Jehovah stated through His prophet Daniel, with reference to the time of the end where we now are, that then “knowledge </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">.shall </span><span class="font16">be increased”. (Daniel 12:4) Seeing, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">then, </span><span class="font16">that we are in the beginning </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">“that day”, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">that the Lord promised that the peoples </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">shall ' </span><span class="font16">know Him </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">in that day,</span><span class="font16"> we should </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">reasonably </span><span class="font16">’Ml expect to find </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font16">this </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Pyramid much corrobora- ?-$ </span><span class="font14">live evidence of the </span><span class="font16">divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font16">Pharisees claimed to represent Jehovah, &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14">’occupying a position </span><span class="font16">in the social order of their </span><span class="font14">time as the ecclesiastical </span><span class="font16">leaders and teachers. </span><span class="font14">These </span><span class="font16">Pharisees were blind guides of the blind; - A: </span><span class="font14">i. </span><span class="font16">e., </span><span class="font14">neither the </span><span class="font16">leaders nor the led understood God's purposes, because the Pharisees had forsaken the spirit of the Word of God. When Jesus made His triumphant entry into Jerusa-<sub>v</sub> .’J| lem, the whole multitude began to praise G&quot;&gt;d -j| with a loud voice, and the Pharisees said to Jesus: “Master, rebuke them”. Jtnd Jesus ”'4 answered: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font16"> tell you, if these should hold their </span><span class="font14">peace, the </span><span class="font16">stones would immediately cry out”.— Lulw 19:37-40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The counterpart of the Pharisees is found </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font16">3 </span><span class="font14">the </span><span class="font16">dt-rgy of the church nominal, Catholic </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and-</span><span class="font16">Protestant, of our day. Foreknowing Ilie course• &quot;kg </span><span class="font14">these </span><span class="font16">would lake now, the prophet of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">y||| </span><span class="font16">wrote: “The Lord hath poured out un. •&gt; you the- -s|| spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed wuir eyeSyg|| g; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">[of </span><span class="font16">understanding]: the preachers and your K* </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">rulers, </span><span class="font16">the seers hath he covered, and the vision g, [understanding of God’s plan] of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">f . Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and f_- with their lips do honor me, but have removed K their heart far from me, and their fear toward </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">me </span><span class="font16">is taught by the precept of men: therefore, 5- behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work K among this people, even a marvelous work and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">wonder: for the.wisdom of their wise men r [clergy] shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”—Isaiah 29:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">| &nbsp;&nbsp;10-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">|r Jesus commissioned His followers to preach </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">[ the </span><span class="font16">coming of His kingdom as the panacea for t'. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">ills of mankind. He taught His followers </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">f'</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"> to </span><span class="font16">pray for its coming. Now at this end of the t' world we find that the great majority of the clergy have abandoned the teachings of the Lord 5 and have joined hands with Big Business and J professional politicians in the formation of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">t-, man-made thing, the League of Nations, of |J- which they say: “This is the political expression r </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">the kingdom of God on earth”. Verily, the r' prophecy is fulfilled concerning them; and f? verily, the time is come for God’s great stone r in the world (the land of Egypt) to become a * witness. With keen interest, then, it should be f examined and studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">* ' The entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north side, opening upon a long descending passage, which continues downward until it ?. reaches a subterranean chamber in the natural solid rock. That chamber is wide, but has an</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">' uneven floor. Symbolically this represents the ; course of the human race. Shortly after Adam f <sup>1</sup> was created he violated God’s law and was ex, &quot;&nbsp;pelled from Eden; and his course and the course of his offspring have been downward - - since, even to the present time, when we have , reached a condition of trouble and unrest which &lt;&nbsp;is pictured by the uneven floor of the subterra* nean chamber. Now we have come to a time When ecclesiastically, politically, financially and \ socially, mankind is in trouble and distress. The &gt;&nbsp;war, famine, pestilence, distress of nations, perplexity, social unrest, revolution and threatened 1 anarchy are clearly pictured by this subterranean chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The descending passage is nearly 340 feet in length, the greater portion of which is cut through natural solid rock. About one-fourth of the distance from the entrance, this descending passage is intersected by the first ascending passage, which, like the descending passage, is low (about four feet in height) and which continues upward for a distance of 1542 pyramid inches and opens into the grand gallery. The grand gallery is narrow at the bottom, but widens near the top. It is seven times as lofty as the first ascending passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thirty-three and one-half inches from the end of the first ascending passage one encounters the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“well”.</span><span class="font16"> This has the appearance of having been once closed and later opened by an explosion from beneath. The “well” continues downward in an irregular course and intersects the descending passage near its end, in the natural rock. At the intersecting point of the first ascending passage and the grand gallery is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">horizontal passage leading into what is designated the Queen’s chamber. At the upper end of the grand gallery is a low horizontal passage leading into the ante-chamber; and beyond </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">ante-chamber, another low horizontal passage which leads into the King’s chamber. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">It is of ■ </span><span class="font16">great interest to notice the symbolic meaning of these passages and how they corroborate, first ‘ the downward course of man, then God’s provision for man’s redemption </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and restoration, </span><span class="font16">and the exaltation of the church </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to glory, honor </span><span class="font16">and immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The key to the whole situation is the “well”. Since the well has the appearance of having been opened by an explosion, it pictures our Lord’s death and resurrection, through which He brought life and immortality to light. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font16">Scotchman, Robert Menzies, in 1868, after ex-, amining the Great Pyramid, wrote with reference to the well: “From the north beginning of . the grand gallery, in upward progression, begin the years of our Savior’s life, expressed at the rate of a year for an inch”. The 33J inches here picture the time from Jesus’ birth as a babe </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font16">Bethlehem to His death on the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The downward passage, as we have already suggested, pictures the downward course of humanity from the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden to the end of the present evil </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">order. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The first ascending passage, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">which intersects &quot;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18">S'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">entrance or descending passage, together with the granite plug (which closes the lower </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">end </span><span class="font16">of this upward passage), by measurement , exactly pictures the length of the Jewish age. The first ascending passage, therefore, represents the covenant God made with the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai, by which covenant He offered to give them life if they would keep it. They were unable to keep the covenant; hence unable to gain life, symbolized by this ascend</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font16">passage. It was life on the human plane, of course, that had been lost by Adam; and God’s plan provides that there is no other name given under heaven whereby men can get life except through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jesus himself said: “I am come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly”. (John 10:10) St. Paul said: “Jesus Christ, by </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">grace of God, tasted death for every man”. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews </span><span class="font16">2: 9) And again : “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font16">all, to be testified [to all] in due time”. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font16">Timothy 2:5,6) The death and resurrection of Jesus constitute a guarantee that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font16"> men shall have one opportunity for life on the human plane (Acts 17:31): and ultimately </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">those who obey </span><span class="font16">the terms upon which life </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font16">offered will be restored to perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This restitution blessing is pictured by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">B - </span><span class="font16">rorizontal passage which extends from the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt;&nbsp;■ . upper </span><span class="font16">opening of the well to the Queen’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">chamber. But </span><span class="font16">these blessings of restitution can </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">come </span><span class="font16">only in God’s due time, and will come during the Messianic reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Before the beginning of these blessings for mankind the Christ, Jesus the Head and the church His body, must be completed and united in glory. The grand gallery therefore pictures </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">Gospel dispensation, or period of time in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font16">God has visited the people of earth to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">take out </span><span class="font16">“a people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) Applying the rule of measurement—an inch for</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">, ■ a year—</span><span class="font16">the grand gallery indicates the length </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">' ’ of </span><span class="font16">the Gospel dispensation. It is narrow and steep of ascent and has been difficult to climb, t- It, therefore, pictures the narrow way which the Christian must follow—the difficulties through </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">., which he </span><span class="font16">passes as </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">joint-saerificer with </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">his * &nbsp;&nbsp;Redeemer—</span><span class="font16">and which leads to glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">-The grand gallery, then, represents the dis-</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">pensation of grace or favor to a certain class; but before they can start up that grand gallery they must receive justification, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font16">that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font16">corresponds to human perfection, by the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">exer</span><span class="font16">cise of faith in the merit of Christ’s sacrifice, and are then made acceptable as a part of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font16">sacrifice. In other words, by faith these </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">receive </span><span class="font16">at the beginning of the grand gallery what </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">world will receive at the end of the Messianic reign, with this difference: that the world </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font16">be actually restored to perfection of mind </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">organism, while the members who constitute </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">church are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">counted</span><span class="font16"> as perfect human </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">beings <sub>r </sub></span><span class="font16">through the imputation of the merit of Christ in order that they might be received as a </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font16">of the sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The grand gallery ending pictures that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">Gospel age will come to an end at some </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">time;, </span><span class="font16">that the privilege of walking in the narrow </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">way </span><span class="font16">of self-sacrifice, in Jesus’ footsteps, will </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We here mention a point that may be of interest. Since the erection of the Great Pyramid the grand gallery has been difficult to ascend; but early in July, 1919, there was begun </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">construction of a stairway or steps leading from the lower to the upper end of this </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">passage/ </span><span class="font16">with an iron handrail .on-either side'.'. This </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font16">completed in October, 1919; and since that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">time -</span><span class="font16">the difficulty of walking up this narrow way </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From the grand gallery one passes </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">into the </span><span class="font16">ante-chamber, and from that into the King’s chamber, which pictures the passing of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the * </span><span class="font16">members of the church into the condition </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">glory, honor and immortality, with the Lord Jesus, by participation in the first resurrection ■ and being made members of the royal priesthood on the divine plane with the Master. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font16">is described by the Revelator thus: “Blessed&quot; and holy is he that hath part in the first </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">resur- ' </span><span class="font16">rection: on such the second death hath </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font16">power, but they shall be priests of God and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years”.—Revelation 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Scientific measurements and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">calculations </span><span class="font16">demonstrate that the measurement of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Pyra</span><span class="font16">mid at its base on the four sides at the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">level of </span><span class="font16">the cornerstones gives as </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">many pyramid inches </span><span class="font16">as there are days in four years, to the fraction, including the leap-year </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">fraction.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Satan’s Counterfeit</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There has been much discussion among scholars as to the reason for the building of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">pyramids. A </span><span class="font16">short distance south and east of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">. the </span><span class="font16">Great Pyramid stands another pyramid, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font16">still others further south. A few miles up </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">. the </span><span class="font16">Nile is a number of smaller pyramids. The . Sphinx stands to the southeast of the Great Pyramid, and between the Nile and the larger ‘ pyramid nearest the Great Pyramid. Near the '• ” Sphinx at one time stood a great temple; and extending from that temple to the pyramid standing nearest to the Pyramid of Gizeh was a subterranean passage. The evidence seems con</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">clusive </span><span class="font16">that this temple, the Sphinx, and the pyramid connected with them by the underground passage, as well as all the other pyra</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">mids </span><span class="font16">thereabouts, with the exception of the Great Pyramid, were built under the direction </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">Satan for the specific purpose of diverting </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">minds of the people from the lessons taught </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font16">the “witness unto the Lord”, and to blind </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font16">as to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font16">purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font16">order to distinguish the Great Pyramid of Gizeh from the one nearest to it, that which was connected with the ancient temple, we designate </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">latter as Pyramid No. 2. An examination </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font16">construction of Pyramid No. 2 was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">1 From a distance it looks very much like the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. Upon closer inspec-: tion, bov-■•ver, it is seen that the stones are not placed in symmetrical order. The entrance is on the north side, just as in the Great Pyramid, and opens upon a downward passage which, leads to a vault in the center of the structure, where were buried at one time the remains of the royalty of Egypt. This tomb was connected by a subterranean passage with the temple above mentioned. There are no other passages in this pyramid (No. 2); and the same is true of the other lesser pyramids. Only the Great Pyramid contains the passages hereinbefore described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Without doubt Pyramid No. 2 and the other lesser pyramids along the Nile were used </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font16">tombs for the burial of the royal dead of Egypt. With this indisputable evidence before them, the majority of explorers of the pyramids have reached the conclusion that they were all built by the ancient Egyptians for use as tombs. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font16">proof, however, shows that no one was ever buried in the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. Why, then, should Pyramid No. 2 and the other smaller pyramids have been built in the vicinity of the Great Pyramid? The answer seems to be clear, that Satan, who has at all times opposed the development of the divine plan relative to man, produced those counterfeits </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font16">purpose of blinding mankind to the divine </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ar</span><span class="font16">rangement; and with the building of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font16">pyramids and their use as tombs, in connection with the temple for Satanic worship, he </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font16">seemingly accomplished his design of blinding the minds of men to the true interpretation </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">God’s plan as pictured by His stone witness, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The four divine attributes—wisdom, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">power, </span><span class="font16">justice and love, as shown by the prophet </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Ezekiel </span><span class="font16">—are pictured, respectively, by the eagle, the ox, the lion and man. Satan has attempted to coun- -terfeit these divine attributes. Examination of the Sphinx reveals that its body represents that of a crouching lion, while the head and face </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font16">those of a man, with wings on the sides like unto those of an eagle. It was seemingly im- &quot;&nbsp;possible here to show the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font16"> attributes, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font16">eagle’s; and in some instances the feet are shown to be those of an ox; thus indicating </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">again </span><span class="font16">Satan’s attempt to divert the minds of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">people from the Lord by his various coun</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">terfeits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nearly all visitors in Cairo are directed to </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">museum. We visited it also. Among its </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">exhibits </span><span class="font16">are </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">great many things of Satanic </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">origin. </span><span class="font16">Much has been said and written about </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">• the </span><span class="font16">preservation of dead bodies, called mummies. In this museum may be seen the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">’ preserved </span><span class="font16">bodies of men and women, who, it is claimed, were of the old royal line of Egypt— Rameses II and III, for instance; and others. These mummies were taken from the tombs &quot;which are found in the numerous pyramids </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">along </span><span class="font16">the Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Here again appears an attempt on the part of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan to </span><span class="font16">dispute God’s purpose concerning sin</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ful man. It </span><span class="font16">was the decree of Jehovah, upon </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">entering </span><span class="font16">His judgment against disobedient </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Adam/ </span><span class="font16">that “dust thou art and unto dust shalt </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">thou </span><span class="font16">return”. The preservation of the bodies of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font16">Egyptian rulers who represented Satan ' was, without doubt, an attempt on the adversary’s part to dispute the decree of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">By these silent mummies Satan has said: </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font16">will prove that the decree of Jehovah is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font16">true; these shall not return to the dust. Their bodies I preserve and exhibit as visible evi- ' dences that the decree of Jehovah is not true.” And thus he has deceived many. There would seem to be no other reasonable purpose in preserving these human bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The museum in Cairo also contains a large number of statues of rulers of ancient Egypt; and upon the face of each of these figures is </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font16">expression of apparent superiority over others and of disdain for others—this doubtless one of Satan’s designs to establish the “divine right of kings” to rule over the peoples of earth. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Truly </span><span class="font16">Satan, the god of this world, has blinded </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">minds of men, “lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them”. But thanks be to God, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">day</span><span class="font16"> is at hand! The light of Messiah’s kingdom is beginning to shine; and soon this fraud and deception will be exposed, the darkness dispelled and the light of truth beam forth upon the faces of men everywhere, until even darkest Egypt shall become a land of light, truth and rejoicing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">There has existed a necessity for keeping this mystery hidden, else it would not have been so kept. It was necessary, because to have revealed the plan in full to mankind would have been to frustrate it. Had men known, they would not have crucified either the Lord of glory or the church which is His body. (1 Corinthians 2:8) Not only would the death of Christ, as the price of man’s redemption, have been interfered with, y had not the plan been kept a mystery from the; world, but the trial of the faith of the church,;;</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">131.</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"> Why is the peculiar course in which the “little flock” has been called to walk a mystery to the world?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">Not only is the plan of God and the Christ which is the very embodiment of that plan, a </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font16">mystery to the world, but the peculiar </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">course </span><span class="font16">in which this little flock is called to walk </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">marks </span><span class="font16">its members as “peculiar people”. It was </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">mystery to the world that a person of so much ability as Jesus of Nazareth should spend his time and talent as he did, whereas, if he had turned his attention to politics, law, merchandise </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font16">popular religion, he might have become great and respected. In the opinion of men he foolishly wasted his life, and they said, “He hath </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">devil and is mad”. His life and teachings were _ ' mysteries to them. They could not understand </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The apostles and their companions were likewise mysteries in the world, in leaving their business prospects, etc., to preach forgiveness </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">sins through the death of the despised and crucified Jesus. Paul forsook a high station and social influence to labor with his hands, and to preach Christ, and the invisible crown for all be</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">lievers </span><span class="font16">who should walk in His footsteps. This </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font16">so mysterious that some said, “Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">thee </span><span class="font16">mad”. And all who so follow in the Master’s footsteps are, like Paul, counted fools for Christ’s sake.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">132. Tl’ifl </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the divine purposes always remain shrouded in mystery ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">But God’s plan will not always be shrouded in mystery; the dawn of the Millennial day brings </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">fuller light of God to men, and “the knowl</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">edge </span><span class="font16">of the Lord shall fill the whole earth”. The Sun of Righteousness, which shall rise with </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">healing </span><span class="font16">in His wings, dispelling the darkness of ignorance, is the Christ in Millennial glory— </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font16">the Head alone, but also the members of His </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">body; </span><span class="font16">for it </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font16">written, “If we suffer with him, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font16">shall also be glorified together”; “When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory”; and “Then </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font16">the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father”. — Romans 8:17; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font16">Timothy 2:11, 12; Colossians 3:4; Matthew </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">13:43. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Now, to all except those begotten to a new mind, by receiving “the mind of Christ”, the promises which we believe, and the hopes which we cherish, seem visionary, and too improbable to be received or acted upon. In the age to come, when God shall “pour out his spirit upon all flesh”, as during the present age He pours it upon His “servants and handmaids”, then indeed all will understand and appreciate the promises <sub>j </sub>now being grasped by the “little flock”; and they will rejoice in the obedience and exaltation of the church.—Revelation 19:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">They will rejoice in the glorification of the ‘ church, through which blessings will then </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">be = <sub>; </sub></span><span class="font16">flowing to them; and while they will realize </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that , </span><span class="font16">the “exceeding great and precious promises” inherited by the Anointed (Head and body) </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">are . </span><span class="font16">not for them, but are fulfilled upon us, they </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font16">be blessed by the lesson in the church; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and while % </span><span class="font16">they run for the blessings then held out to them, they will profit by the example of the church, ’ and glorify God on her behalf. But this knowl- ' edge will not bring covetousness; for under </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the -. </span><span class="font16">new order of things their calling </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">to perfect: -<sub>v </sub></span><span class="font16">human nature will fully satisfy them, </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and will </span><span class="font16">seem more desirable than a change </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">of nature. ”,</span></p>

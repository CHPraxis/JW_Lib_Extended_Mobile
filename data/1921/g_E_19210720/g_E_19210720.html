<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>A Soldier’s Doubts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. B. Csbvkb, Captain of Infantry, U. S. X, died in France of tuberculosis contracted in the trenches. His trunk was sent to his mother in New York State; in it she,found a letter written in France on October 25,1918, between three and four weeks before the signing of the armistice. The captain was an only son, and a * fine young man in every respect. The letter follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Sometimes in the strenuous course of events that take place at the present time, certain thoughts spring up in one’s mind—queer thoughts, too, that cause one to ask questions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">These questions ought to be answered by some one. The answer may be hard to. find; but if one believes what he has been taught, the answer exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is a thought and a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Becently a soldier who entertained some doubt as to the existence of a future life, had ample opportunity to witness many a scene on the Western Front Thia soldier also at times had doubted the orthodox teachings of future rewards and future punishments. At other times he even doubted the existence of a God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">He joined an Infantry Battalion one afternoon, and was finally assigned to duty with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">That night he ate his mess in one of the small groups, which were fed at intervals. Death and destruction had for some time been constant attendants of this group</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">• of men. They were a grim, dete</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">rmin</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ed, fighting group of American Dougldioys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">At mess the Doubter heard rough talk, curses, ribald talk, songs, and coarse, low jokes. Later, in the dugout, he watched the men gamble, heard them relate bragging stories of past drinking bouts, of wild women; while he joined in with them listening, the roar of the artillery mingled with the voices within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer, the Doubter, drew aside for a few momenta. He had vividly remembered some teachings &lt;tf bygone years. He looked back and dug from memory the sayings of his teachers in America, when he was at school. He recalled a Bible course that he had taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">It had taught that the good shall live everlastingly. ' * lie bad shall perish in punishments. The good will</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">assemble in heaven. The wicked are provided for in helL</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ITio good are defined as the men who live temperate lives, who do not taka ths name of God in vain, who think clean thoughts, who respect women.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The wicked are the men who drink to excess, who curse, who think low thoughts, who do not respect women.</span></a></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">3. a. m.</span></a></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The night passes on; no one sleeps.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Zero hour now.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The enemy resistance is enormous. At this hour the American Doughboys go over the top.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The first line is gone.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The second pierces the first line trench of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Still a third wave reinforces the swiftly disappearing fighters.'</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The daylight comes with cold mist. The mud is deep, thick and slippery. The Doughboys have been sixty hours in wet clothes without sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Doubter is one of the men in the third wave. The objective has been reached. The slaughter has been enormous. Stretched among a mass of shattered mi™, the Doubter recognizes one of the man who only the night before laughed and cursed as he told in his way of .some wild days gone by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">There was not much to bury. His limbs were gone* and his body was badly mangled. A blood-stained letter taken from his 0. D. shirt read in scrawling lines: “Mother, I thought of you to the end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Doubter read the mother's address. For her it is a dark picture. He was the only son. He was red-blooded, rough; he cursed as he died; but he fought fiendishly to the last drop, as all Americans fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The teachers at home, the Soul-Savers, taught that this soldier has gone to helL He was decidedly wicked, as they say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The lonely mother back home has given her one son. He fought a glorious fight for liberty. He died in action. He went to hell as hie reward. His punishment is everlasting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Doubter has begun to think queer thoughts. He is forced to ask now questions of the Soul-Savers back homo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">He asks whether the Soul-Savers are not men who</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">h*ve eyes, and see not, ears that hear not</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Do they have any conception of thia one of millions of like instances oh the battle field?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps they do not even comprehend the teachings of the God they protean to worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The questions come in a flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Can you answer them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">If there is a heaven and a hell, can you, who save •onia, tell the Doubter where the line is drawn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Which ones among the millions who have fallen in glorious action in France, go to heaven, and which ones go to hell?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">If a just God rules, would He not in justice forgive each man who fell in action ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Bead the lines by Chaplain T. F. Coaklpy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Not since Thine own great sacrifice</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon the Sacred Hill of Calvary,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Has such a flood-tide set toward Paradise, The countless millions slain to make men free. They are the pure in mind, the clean of heart, Unspotted holocausts, who kept Thy law— Our first-born pons who played the victors' part— Thy judgments will find in them no flaw.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Who are the pure in mind, the clean of heart, and who kept the law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The men who cursed as they died? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The men who laughed and drank?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The men who found diversion in immoral women ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Doubter demands an answer, because he has </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">seen </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">men die like this—because he knows that millions of men have died, and are dying now, who are not classed among the saved by the well-meaning Soul-Savers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Is there a heaven? Is there a hell? If there is, which among those who have fallen on the field of honor go to heaven and which ones to hell? And if some go to each, who decides, and how ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">And if you cannot answer, what does it avail you to study your theology, your Bible lessons?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I ask this in behalf of the Doubter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">C. B. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Carves,</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Captain of Infantry, U. S. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">In France, October 25, 1918. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Permits Eoil &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">OES God permit evil? Did Almighty God</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">permit the World War? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19210720_files/g_E_19210720-2.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">God is all-powerfuL He is the Almighty. “All things are possible with God.” God could stop anything. The Creator who made the stars, who set them in motion and who maintains them in their courses, would have had no trouble in preventing the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But according to the Apostle Paul, “the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hmo</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">R of this ignorance God winked at.” (Acts 17: 30) He manifestly has permitted evil</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The first evil act among men was the act of disobedience recorded of the first human pair in their nurity and nerfection in the Garden of <sub>a</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Eden. Adam and his sweetheart, Eve, were on their honeymoon—in modern phrase—for the first year or two in their perfect home. They loved one another deeply, tenderly, devotedly, as only the perfect can love. They were the human embodiment of Him of whom it is writ- ’ <sub>t </sub>ten, “God is love”. They exemplified perfect ’4 love. They loved God and every living being. They had sweet intercourse with their Creator, and with other perfect beings. Among these mighty beings Was their friend and benefactor, a mighty angel named “The Morning Star”. - . This great one was their special guardian and protector. They were devotedly attached to “The Morning Star”; they loved him, and trust- ' ed him implicitly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerning “The Morning Star” it was written: “Thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee.....Thou</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God. Every precious stone [good character quality] was thy covering.......Thou art the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">anointed cherub that covereth [defends and protects the human ones]; and I [Jehovah] have set thee so; thqu wast upon the mountain f [dominion] of God; thou hast walked [proceed- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ed] up and down in the midst of the stones of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">fire [the shining stars of the universe].” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">f</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But evil entered into the heart of this great ‘ angel, unprevented by God. Shakespeare puts it, *, “Ambition—by this sin fell the angels&quot;. The ; Divine Record says: “Thou wast perfect in thy .. ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee... .Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast cor- , rupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness .... Thou hast set .thine heart [to be] as the heart of God [to be a ruler of a dominion like God].”—Ezekiel 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">This is the story of how the evil in the universe started, in the determination of a glorious angel to be first among the creation of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Morning Star” had changed his character, and with the change is given another name, “Satan,” the adversary, “devil,” the slanderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">This “prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” (Ephesians 2:2), as “the god of this world, hath blinded the minds of them which believe not”.—2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The first one whose mind was blinded was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">woman Eve, who had loved and trusted “The Morning Star”. Not knowing about his change to “Satan” and “Devil”, the woman trustingly was deceived, and committed the act of disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The divine law had defined the penalty, “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die”. (Genesis 2:17) Adam was not deceived. He knew the penalty that his bride had incurred. He believed that within twenty-four hours she would be dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What would any young man, devotedly attached to his bride, do, if he saw her swept from his reach in the waters at the brink of Niagara! Unable to save her in whom his affections were centered, he would join her in the sweep of the cataract. Adam was not deceived; but he did not know that God had in mind a thousand-year day. He was desperate—and joined his bride in an act which would bring in death release from the torture of his heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“By one man, sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all.”— Bomans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">All this could have been prevented by the Almighty. With the first ambitious thought, “The Morning Star” could have been blotted out. In thunder tones the voice of God might have swept through Eden and warned the woman of her danger. In mightier voice the God of Love could have held back the man from his sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But God was silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Almighty permitted the sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Three Positions</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T THIS point the reader can take one of three positions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">He can decide, without further consideration, that a God who permits evil is evil Himself;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">That God is a myth, like Santa Claus, and belief in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> a superstition, which should be swept into oblivion as unspeakably harmful to the world (This is the position of Robert Blatchford, Colonel Ingersoll, and many of the anarchists) ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Or that Jehovah is infinite in justice, wisdom, love and power, and that in some way it was and is best to permit evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We take the third proposition, that the permission of evil will work out greater good than its prevention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">How can good come from permission of evilf</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first place the difference must be clearly seen between </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">doing</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> evil that good may come, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">permitting</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> evil that good may come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">It is clearly wrong to do evil that good may come from the evil done. In this ease the doer of evil is a benefactor, without dean hands. Such a course is forbidden by laws human and divine. God never does evil. “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right!” says God's friend, Abraham, by inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Though he slay me, yet will I trust him,** said that greatest poet of all time, the lover of God, Job. Whatever the evil permitted, God will do the right thing. No evil will bo permitted which will not bring an ultimate benefit. &quot;Surely,” says David, “the wrath of man [divinely permitted] shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath [evil too great to result in good] shalt thou restrain.”—Psalm 76:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Permission or Prevention ? <sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">OW CAN the permission of evil result in good, and be better than its prevention!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A child and a stove—the child is warned that the stove will burn him if he touches it Ultimately he is burned. If the child never learned by experience, he might one day burn himself severely; conceivably he might walk into a flaming fire and be consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it better to chain the child, so he can never get near a fire; or to allow him the liberty which will result in his learning to fear the flame!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Boys are warned against a variety of evils— drink, gambling, fast women. Most boys try the evils in spite of the warnings. By experience they learn to avoid evils because they find that the evils are harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Would it be better to lock the boys up in cells under religious keepers and wardens and keep them from evil! or to allow them the liberty which permits experiences so unpleasant that ultimately they will not only avoid them, but loathe them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">God made man a free moral agent He respects the free moral agency. He coerces the will of no intelligent being in heaven or on earth. A free moral agent Himself, He made man in His own mental and moral likeness, a free moral agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">How can free moral agents be safeguarded against evil! By prevention of evil! or by the restricted permission of evil! Only through an experience with evil or an observation of evil</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">sufficient to produce a loathing for all evil, can free moral agents be safeguarded in mind and character, su that they will always choose the good and avoid the eviL Thus are produced men who are “as gods**, knowing good and evil, and ever preferring the course which is right. Such have the spirit of God, the disposition to do instinctively as God would do. ‘The hour cometh... when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him... .They that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth,&quot; says Jesus.—John 4:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">All the human race will ultimately have this spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">One free moral agent is not responsible for the acts of another free moral agent. The exception is where one is set as a watchman to warn another; the trackman that lets a train thunder into an abyss without warning is guilty of the blood of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Says God: “When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tor</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> their watchman; if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he bloweth the trumpet, and warn the people; then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning: his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the. trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.”—Ezekiel 33:2-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A prominent clergyman says: “When they set ns up on soap-boxes to preach war, we ought to have told the truth”. If the clergy—self-styled divine watchmen — had blown the trumpet of truth, they would not be guilty of the blood of the slain of the World War. It -is not too late for them to do their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">No one is responsible for the acts of his neighbor. Neither is God to blame for the acts of oilier free moral agents: for God warned humanity, in its earliest days, and for two thousand years through the Bible and such Christianity as there was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Outbalanced by the Good</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">O PERMIT evil is beie ib ial. provided there come afterward blessii:'_’&lt; • hich more than offset the pain and distress ef die &lt;&nbsp;vil. and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">which could not otherwise be attained by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The time for the offsetting blessings is the Golden Age, just about to dawn, when “millions now living will never die**.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Then humanity will be under a reign of goodness and of blessing such as the loftiest dreams of man have never imagined. “There shall be showers of blessing.** (Ezekiel 34:26) “Drop . down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness,” says the inspired prophet. (Isaiah 45:8) “I will open the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”—Malachi 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The coming blessings and their undeservedness are spoken of again: “Then will I sprinkle clean water [truth] upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you... .And I will call for ' the corn [grain], and will increase it, and lay no ' famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field.. .Then shall ye remember your own evil ways [of the present and the past], and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your dwn sight for your [past] iniquities, and for your [past] abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you.. .1 do not this for your sakes, but for mine holy name’s sake.... And I will sanctify [make sacred] my great name.” (Ezekiel 36) In yet another place it is foretold that men will not be able to contain themselves, but will weep for very joy at </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the goodness of God</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">—in the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The new and better order of things with its good will be so satisfying that the old — the present evil order of things—will never be desired again. “Behold, I create new heavens [spiritual powers 0 f control, the reigning Christ] and a new earth [social order based on divine love, the golden rule]; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind [as past privations pass out of mind in present joy]” (Isaiah 65:17) Men will never desire the old ways of sin and evil with which they had an average lifetime experience of thirty-three years each. The goodness of the better age will outbalance a thousand times the distress and trouble of the time of the permission of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Any person who would then show a preference for the old ways of selfishness and sin will</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">be justly </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">regarded</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> as an enemy of mankind, a cumberer of^the ground. “Every soul which will not hear {pbeyjthat Prophet [Christ, then reigning to fil^ss] shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:23) It is to be hoped that there will not be many such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What of the Soldier ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">UT what of the man that cursed as he died?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Golden Age is the time of resurrection of the dead. The good since Christ’s time will be raised to be spirit beings and be with Him in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us picture the future of those who the Soul-Savers say have gone to hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Answers to prayer will be prompt and sure in those days. “Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear,” declares the prophet—Isaiah 65:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Ja answer to prayer the dead will come back to their families. In place of family ties broken by death, there will be a wonderful reknitting together of heart-strings long torn, but never satisfied until the answer comes when “all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth [to resurrection]”.—John 5:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">.The dead soldier’s mother, perhaps, will raise her voice daily for God to remember His promise and bring back from the field of honor the boy who in 1918 laid down his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Some day the answer will come: “The boy is coming back tomorrow; get his room, ready; assemble the friends that he loved; have a feast prepared, music and flowers and light; for tomorrow when the oft-repeated prayer is spoken for the last time, there will stand again in your midst your soldier-boy, never to leave you again, , if he will but conform to the goodness of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Golden Age.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Back home at last is the soldier who cursed as he died—now to learn the truth about the life that can be his forever, to learn that his return was through the Redeemer, who laid down His human life that all might have one full, fair chance for eternal life. What soldier is there who would not then take the oath of allegiance to the Savior, and keep it as faithfully as he kept the oath to his country!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Boys spend four hard years in an apprenticeship to qualify for ten times four years, to earn a better living than the average. Others go eight years to college and professional school, and think the privations well endured for the opportunity to win a competence for five times eight years. How well worth will be the average thirty-three years lesson in evil, permitted by a wise Father, when the experience with that evil makes it possible for a free moral agent to crystalize his character against evil and have the opportunity to live forever—not merely with slightly better conditions than^those of the period of evil but in the abounding life of perfection ; not for a </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">time</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> but for eternity; not in conditions ternfed in the Bible the devil’s kingdom, but in an earth transformed by human achievement into a Paradise—“the Paradise of God”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Thirty-three years of evil for an eternity of good!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Who would not willingly pay the price!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Moreover, if evil had never been permitted, neither angels nor men could have understood the lengths and breadths and heights and depths of the love of a God who loves His enemies, who is kind to wrongdoers, who forgives sins and pardons iniquities, who permits evil but overwhelms evil with good—who is Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">By permission of evil there is made manifest that Jehovah has a character infinite in Justice, Wisdom, Power and Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">To everlasting ages men will understand a God who will shine in their hearts’ devotion with a radiance hr rliter than the noonday sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> CONSECRATED my life to God in June, 1915, and became what is known as a Conscientious Objector, because God’s Word commands that we shall not take life and that we shall love our enemies. I was very patriotic, and in October, 1914, had offered my. services in the army; but heing at that time only 19 years old and not fully developed, I was considered too small</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In February, 1916,1 presented to the authorities a sworn statement that in the event of conscription in Canada I would not accept service, as I objected to the war on Christian principles. After fighting the case through three courts or tribunal.®, including Ottawa, I was arn&gt;t»d &lt;&gt;&gt;1 the 18th of January, 1918, together with a friend who was of the same opinion as myself, and taken to the Detention Barracks in Winnipeg. There we were taken before an officer, who requested us to sign the attestation papers. This we both refused to do. That afternoon we were taken to Minto Street Barracks, and immediately brought before certain officers, who gave us much abusive language, in order to frighten us. But on finding that we were firm, they separated us, putting my friend in one Company and me in another. That night we slept on a bench in the basement, because we had refused to sign for blankets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We spent Saturday and Sunday in this manner, and on Monday morning were ordered to go to work in the kitchen. This we refused to do. You may wonder why this refusal, and I answer: Because the military authorities were so crafty that it was impossible to give them one inch. They would always try to get one to take a step, with the promise that it was all that would be required; and then* as soon as that step was taken, they would try to work one forward another step. Giving way one step made it all the . harder to resist the next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">By afternoon we were both locked up in the dink We slept on the floor that night; and the next morning the Provost Sergeant, together with two policemen, came for my friend and took </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> away. He returned in about one-half hour, cold and shivering, his teeth chattering. They had stripped him and placed him under the ice-cold shower bath for several minutes. After dinner they came for him again, and this time brought </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> back unconscious. They dragged his body across the drill hall, and upon reaching the cell let him drop like a rag. From two o’clock in the afternoon until eight o’clock that night he lay there, without medical aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">As soon as they brought him in they took me out; and when we reached the shower bath, they ordered me to undress. I refused; and they pulled off my clothes and placed me under the ice-cold water. Outside it was 30 degrees below zero. Soon my teeth began to chatter, and I began to feel as though I would drop to pieces. After a time tliey turned off the water an»i said: 'Will you put the khaki on?” I said: •N(&gt;&quot;. Then the water was turned on again. After another spell the same question was asked. and again the same answer. Then the hot water was turned on, and a thick cloud of steam engulfed me; then the cold water again, and in a few minutes I fell on the stone floor exhausted. I was then taken back to the cell, where my friend still lay dead to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The rest of the afternoon I spent rubbing his legs and hands, which were like ice. At night he came to enough to call my name. He then said: “Tell Sergeant----that I forgive him”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and closed his eyes again. I am sure that he thought that he was dying; for he was without feeling from the waist down. About eight o’clock two officers took him to the hospital, and I did not see him again for two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEIVED BY THE EVIL OXE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The next day the officers did not bother me, but on the following day they ordered me to come down to the quarter-master's store and get fitted up with the cloth. This I refused to do, so was taken with force and fitted up. It made me think, by contrast, of those who outwardly look like Christ’s, but whose hearts are far from Him. I looked like a soldier; but in my heart I felt that if the devilish deeds I.had already witnessed, deeds done in God’s name, really represented His kingdom, then I could wish to be forever far away from it all. The devil has a great way of making people think that the rules and laws of his kingdom are the rules and laws of the kingdom of Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The following weeks were spent in serving' terms in the Detention C. B., Punishment Diet, etc., etc., with repeated attempts to make me drill in the hall. During the two terms spent at the Detention Barracks I was used well by the N. C. O.’s and the captain in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">My friend in due time returned from the hospital and rejoined me at Minto Barracks. We were court-martialed, and given two years hard labor in Stony Mountain Penitentiary. After we had arrived there, our hair was shaved to the roots. We were fitted with prison garb, with our numbers all over everything. Any one seeing us would Think: “Well, that is the best place for people who look so dangerous”. How unspeakably small-souled it is for governments to </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">try to</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> undermine the self-respect of decent men by dressing them like tramps and purposely arranging to make their rogues-gallery photographs as ugly as possible 1 At night I used to lie watching the great and small cockroaches on the ceiling o£my cell as the'y went to their midnight banquet; and early in the morning I would see them wending their way home. After three weeks the officers sent for us again, and in five days more we started for England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">On April 10th we were marched down the main street to the station, having been joined by more of our friends; and it was not long before we were placed on the train. The next four days and a half we spent traveling from Winnipeg to Halifax, where on arrival we were immediately placed on a great liner. By accident we were liberated on board, but not for long; and in one hour from the time of going aboard we were all in the clink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">That same evening the guard, acting under orders, took us on deck and ordered us to carry shells to the guns. We refused, and were given fourteen days bread and water, and a sergeant placed in charge of us to “break us in”. For the following week we were taken .on deck twice a day and subjected to indignities. Often there were three hundred to five hundred soldiers standing around the circle in which we were being baited. Sometimes two of us were placed on our backs at opposites of the circle and the others were told to walk around. Two sergeants would stand near the ones lying down, and, as the others passed, would jerk our bodies so qs to make the men step on our faces. We were kicked, pinched, knocked, cursed, called filthy names, and made objects of hate. Despite this, many of the boys were very good to us, and would often bring us little treats, all going to show that the mass are not so evil of mind as were some in authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After a week of this treatment we were taken into the dining-room and given the work of washing the floors. On one occasion the head steward gave instructions that we be taken into the kitchen and given afternoon tea, where they left us for half an hour to enjoy the blessing of a clean meal and of fellowship without the presence of guards. Some hearts are lofty and kind; and there were always some of this class around to give the cup of cold water which shall not lose its reward. While on shipboard I was placed in a little cabin all by myself, because of being a dangerous character (so they said). One day a call went around that we were being attacked by a submarine, and the next minute the guns began to fire. We were rushed up on deck and placed in the front end; but the torpedo missed its mark, and after a short battle we passed the danger and went below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday morning, April 28th, we came on deck, and first saw Liverpool The Liverpool docks were seething with khaki and filled with American ships, the decks of which were lined with soldiers. Everything was there to turn one's reason and to make a man act on emotion instead of reason. Several men on board who were returning from Canada to France seemed able to understand in. some measure that we were sincere, even though they did think ua mistaken; and they treated us kindly, in so far as they were able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">About noon we were landed and were marched to a railroad station; where we boarded a train for Seaford Camp»:WW£ south of England. One of the guards passed some remark to the captain in charge of our party, about our trying to escape; but the captain said: &quot;Oh, you need not worry about those men! They will be all right” At midnight we passed through London, and about 12:30 reached the station, two miles from camp. Here we were lined up in the darkness of a lane, and the roll-call was read. We refused to answer our names when read as Private, etc., but the officer in charge ticked us off as.the names were called. We started for the camp, with a band in thelead. The town was in darkness, on account of the air-raids; rain was falling; and everything seemed forsaken. When we reached the camp we were placed in a tent, and slept on the wet ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTEMPT TO COEBCB</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">When morning came we were ordered out to drill; and we promptly refused. Then we were lined up on the parade ground with a guard on either side. After much shunting up and down we were ordered out of the line, taken back to camp, and placed in the guard tent. The next day the same thing happened again, with the same results. After a few days we were taken to the 11th Reserve, and divided off into different Companies. Ou Saturday night I found myself placed in a hut &quot;with some thirty men who soon found out that I was an objector: but although some used threats, no one laid hands on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">On Sunday morning I was ordered to church parade, and replied that I would not go. At this, two corporals fastened a belt anti a baym.et</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">on rue, put on the puttees, and pushed me into the Lines, where I found one of my friends with</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">' handcuffs on. The band started to play, and to church we went. “Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,” says the Apostle. But we</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1 were in handcuffs, dragged there by force to do outward homage, ostensibly jto a God who “seek-eth such to worship </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> as worship in spirit and in truth”, but really to “the god of this [present evil] world” — the devil On getting back to camp we were liberated again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day proved, to be an eventful</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">one; for right after breakfast we were ordered for physical training. I was made ready and marched up the hill to the training ground, lined</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">* up by force with the rest of the Company. Then I had the pleasure of hearing a short address by the captain. He said: “Boys, these are the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1 men who would let the Germans come over and violate your women folk,&quot; etc., etc., and other</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statements of like nature. He then ordered two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>(</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men to take charge of me. The field was marked</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">with ditches, wire entanglements (not barbed <sup>4</sup> wire), walls of sandbags and, lastly, a sevenfoot wooden wall The soldiers were made to run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> at these, and either, jump them or climb over <sub>t</sub> them as. best they could. When we came to the wall, they hoisted me up and were just about to <sub>r</sub> let me drop when the captain called: “Don’t let him drop!” I was then rushed down the hill to ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an armory, and there saw one of my friends</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being clubbed by a sergeant who had placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">boxing gloves on himself and his quarry. Among</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">• them were gathered several lieutenants and'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">other men who were </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> duty. As I came along</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ they rushed him away and started on me. First</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gloves were placed on my hands; then I was</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">placed before the sergeant, who said: “Now when I say, Guard, put your hands to your face, so”. The next minute he struck me a hard blow ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the face, hard enough to knock me semi-con</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">scious. Then he quickly pulled me to my feet and struck me again, this time on the nose, from</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">pul!&lt;«&lt;i me t&lt;&gt; my feet, and administered another blow on iny face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">At this juncture one of the officers standing by said: “Let that man alone; that's not fair play”. But Captain----said: “If you don’t</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">like to watch it, then get away”. The sergeant caught a handful of my flesh, and pushed and pulled me forward and backward for several</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">minutes, then turned me over to the guards, who took me back to camp, where I stayed for the rest of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">At the end of that week I was placed in the clink, where I remained for five weeks, with the other members of our party, and then was sentenced to one year in Wandsworth Military Prison, London. When we arrived, the man who met us at the door said to us: “You have heard about hell Well, here you are.” They had two mottoes, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“We</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> tame lions”, and “We make or break you”. But they had forgotten that they could not transform a lamb into a lion. Truly the Master said of some of His little ones: &quot;They shall cast some of you into prison, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my sake&quot;, but “he that endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved”. They knew not the power that held us up to endure their rovilings and taunts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We were promptly taken into the alley-way and lined up, told all the things that would befall us if we were going to aot still like fools and cowards, etc., etc. Then we were rushed to our cells. Everything was done on the double-quick at this prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">MTr.T</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TARY TOBTTTM -</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The cell was made of stone, with a large iron-studded door, and was absolutely void of furniture except for a tin gallon-pail of water on a stone shelf. At night they gave me a board, two blankets, a sheet and a pillow. Needless to say,, I did not sleep much that night- On the following morning the N. C. 0. ordered me to get my marching order ready. This consisted of full pack. But </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> did not obey; so as soon as breakfast was over, two N. C. O.’s came and put it on me, and then gave me a rifle to hold. At my refusal they became angry and, after several punches and kicking my ankles, they rushed me before the Commandant, who warned me of the result of trying to hold out. That worthy gave mo three days solitary confinement, with three days bread and water and twenty-one days No. 1 punishment diet. Then I was rushed back to my cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">That day and every day for the first week the N. C. O.’s would come to my cell, strike me in the face, throw me down and kick mo, talk the vilest language, and seem to delight in pulling me opt before the other prisoners. Some of them,'however, hated the work they were bebcg made to do, and once in a while would say a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">word of cheer when no one ^l*as around to overhear. I Buffered greatly during the first two weeks from hunger, as at first I was unable to eat the porridge provided in a dirty can every fourth day for dinner. Sometimes there were lumps as big as eggs in the porridge. I have found cabbage slugs in the soup, bacon rind in the bread, etc., etc. The potatoes were cooked with the jackets on, dirt and all, just as they . came up out of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After I had been there for two weeks, the N. C. O.’s took me out on a certain morning and, placing two of the other prisoners at either side, started to drag me around the courtyard, the guard all the time giving instructions. Then we went around to a lane between two buildings; and for half an hour I was dragged up and down, with a man at each side and one at my back, pushing and pulling, back and forward, as though possessed by the very devil. The man at my right beat me incessantly on my face with his fist; and the man behind me kicked me on the legs as fast as he could do so and keep running. This seemed to satisfy them for the time being; and so with a promise of more the next day, they took me back to my cell and locked me up again. For the next three days I was in great pain, as my throat and jaws were badly swollen and my back teeth were locked together. After the third day I was able to put bread crumbs between my lips and, with a painful effort, swallow them. It was ten days before I was able to eat or drink without pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I was never again violently treated after this, except for an occasional blow from one of the guards while in a fit of temper. But the punishment diet was continued for three and a half months longer. Sometimes I grew almost frantic with hunger, and never knew what it was to feel warm, on account of the poor condition of my blood. It was a common thing for me to walk the cell for hours to keep warm, until too tired to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">On one occasion I awoke and glanced around the damp stone cell, with its cold tile floor. Perhaps I lay there some ten minutes, looking at the big solid door sunk into the four-foot wall, then wearily at the bare cell'again with not even a piece of furniture in it save the hard wooden bed-board upon which I lay. ily meditations were interrupted by the &quot;fall in” whistle of the prison-guard, and in a few minutes the sergeant rapped on the door, at which signal we were expected to sing out in a lusty voice, &quot;All's well<sup>-</sup>, sergeant”. But it is an effort to say such things when one has felt the pangs of hunger for two months steady, tossing around all night with sore bones, caused by the wooden bed and lack of fat over the bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Usually I was able to appreciate the privilege of witnessing for Christ against the powers of darkness; but this day seemed different. My mind was full of unhappy fears, doubts and distress, even to the point of doubting God’s care and love. I arose hastily and was soon pacings the floor in great distress of mind, asking myself the question, Can it be that I have been wrong! What if the whole plan of the ages as brought forth in those wonderful books, “Studies in the Scriptures,” is all wrong? But reason would not permit such conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">About this juncture the famous Wandsworth Prison breakfast was served at the door. It consisted of a square of black bread about 4x 3x3 inches, and for quick delivery was deposited on the bare floor at the door. At a given signal your sergeant or other N. C. -O. on duty opened the door, at which moment with a.loving and tender grip you picked up the daily manna provided, taking care not to lose so much as a crumb, and your gratitude was expected to abound all day, from early morning until 5:15 p. m., at which time another similar loaf was provided. Every fourth week a quarter-ration was served for one week, to revive strength for the following three weeks bread and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After the breakfast the conflict of mind started once again, and so I resolved to tell the Lord my troubles and ask for assurance. Strange to say, the greatest doubts, of all the many in my </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">d seemed to be concerning the Seventh Volume of Scripture Studies, “The Finished Mystery,” which I had time to read only once before my arrest in January, 1918. Three questions I prayed God to answer, if it was His will so to do:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) Is the plan all right, especially the Seventh Volume?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Was the Lord pleased -with my determination to have nothing to do with the support of the war?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) If I faithfully served Him to the best of my ability, would He grant me the reward promised in His Word to them that overcome?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A)x&gt;ut ten o'dock a. m., as &quot;nearly as I could judge, footsteps were heard in the corridor out-, side, and then followed a moment of. breathless waiting to hear whether they woultkstop at my door. We were always interested at .tho ap-■ proach of steps to our cell door^j because of repeated visits from the guards foirthe purpose of abuse. Then the big key clicked* jift-the lock, and a Roman- Catholic corporal entered. He asked my name and, upon being.-.told, said: “This is for you&quot;, and handed me ia<sub>;</sub>little book about x 5 inches, the vest pocket or war edition of the “Finished Mystery”. We talked a few minutes relative to my views; then he left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">This was the first piece of paper in any shape or form that I. had received since entering the prison, June 11. I sat down upon a, stone slab and opened the first page. On it was written a few words of brotherly love from a friend at Kamsack, Saskatchewan. I turned again with an eager hand to read “The Revelation”, as the war edition of the Seventh Volume was called. Previously I had not known of its existence. A strange little book this seemed, yet after all no different from the original version;, and so I read on for some two or three minutes and then, as if guided by some unseen force, threw back, some hundred pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I shall never forget what met my gaze — a picture representing the great apostate church, as viewed by John the Revelatory. Quickly. I threw back two or more pages, as ^though my eyes would not believe what they saw; and thus I read: “And we have the same inspired authority for the statement that only those.'who refuse to render worship to those powerful, influential religious systems (symbolized by the beast and his image) will be counted by the Lord as ‘overeomers’ and l&gt;e made His joint heirs as members of His elect church&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Then it all dawned upon me like a flash of light that here was the answer to my prayers! Yes; surely the truth as I knew it was all right, especially the Seventh Volume; and surely the Lord did approve of the course we had taken. All my questions were answered by that little “Pocket Revelation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I cannot describe the joy and peace received for many a weary day afterward, but true to His covenant God never forsook me. And although there were during that strange year experiences which I can never put into words now, yet looking back I can truly praise the Lord for all the way that He led me. And above all my memories ranks high that little book's visit to Wandsworth Prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After four months at Wandsworth a guard came to take us out and back to Camp Seaford. He was very good to us and on the way back to camp gave us opportunity for a meal of good food. But not one of us was able to retain the food on our stomachs, on account of the weakness of our digestive organs. After a few days, during which we had opportunity to tell many of the boys the good news of Christ’s coming kingdom, We were reshipped to Canada. On the return voyage certain passengers refused to eat with us, and certain returning soldiers threatened to throw us overboard, but were unable to carry out their designs. After a few more weeks in prison at Quebec and Winnipeg, we were ordered to go home. This we did with hearts thankful to the Lord for the privileges He had given us of witnessing to His truth and of suffering for His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A House Divided </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Norman J. Veeder</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Herewith, dear Editor, my child Into your keeping I entrust:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Grant it the milk of mercy mild Nor reconsign It to the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">See how It prattles and it smiles To win its way into your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Employing only baby guiles, All innocent of other art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But if It prove perverse and rude (As often orphaned children do) Cheer up; for I’ve an endless brood: I’U straight another send to you I</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I guess I will take a walk,&quot; I said once upon a time to myself, and myself replied by putting on my little green hat and starting down town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Now it seems that all the members of my body had on this very day decided to mutiny against what they had long considered the intolerable tyranny of myself. My eyes had often accused myself of compelling them to scan long rows of print that were not in the least pretty to look upon, and all for the pleasure of myself alone. My ears had complained that they were compelled to pay attention to long, monotonous discourses that were not in the least melodious and soothing to listen to, and all to satisfy the ca-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">pricioua whin|a of myself. <sub>(</sub>My nose likewise made &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning stuffy</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">rooms; my 'w$gt»raved about tasteless diets; and my legsgrumbled about hard pavements . over which they were constantly required to jolt on hard leather heels. And all my other members had their little complaints and grievances which they had long suffered; but myself being omnipotent, had paid but scant attention to them or had merely laughed scornfully and continued to subject them to its autocratic wilt</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore as I now started to walk to town, I suddenly perceived that things were not as they should be. When I started to turn toward the library, my legs did not turn but continued right on; my eyes refused to look at anything .but grassy plots, flower-gardens and pretty girls; and my nose began sniffing down at a rose in my coat-lapel which made me feel most ridiculous, though I was powerless to do anything but think terrible words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Meanwhile my legs kept plodding along, running hither and thither at every whim of my ears, eyes, and nose, continuing to do all the work and getting ho pleasure at all from the trip, though all the time my eyes were rolling in every direction enjoying the beauties of scenery, while my ears placidly received the sounds of cafS player-pianos and whistled tunes and my nose went sniffing along, now and then repaid by a fragrant whiff from a restaurant or fruit stand or, at times, becoming aware of the proximity of a garbage-can, asking my legs to continue on with increasing celerity. At last my legs grew weary and became angry at this manifest unfairness; and when my eyes next spied a shop-window across the street with a beautiful painting in it, my legs flatly refused to carry them thither but kept right on going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">*T want to see that painting in beautiful colors!” cried my eyes to my legs. &quot;Take me back at once!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I don’t know what you are talking about,” replied my legs. &quot;'What do I care for colors and paintings! I have pampered you long enough. If you want to go back and see anything, go ahead: but as for myself, I shall continue right on to a h:«nch I know in a grocery store, where I intend to stop and sit down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">And they gave a similar answer to my ears when these heard a band playing several blocks away and urged my legs to run in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">My nose fared no better when it vehemently desired my legs to turn aside after a passing peanut-wagon from which was issuing a most celestial aroma. And so my eyes, ears, and nose became excessively angry at my legs, but were powerless to do anything, and had to follow wherever my legs took a notion to go. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Meantime my legs went prancing along, determined to do just as they pleased from now on. Suddenly it occurred to them that they didn’t remember where the grocery bench was; so they called up to my eyes: “Hey there, wake up! Where’s Persimmon’s grocery store?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But my eyes replied: “We don’t know and care less—there’s nothing pretty to be seen there. Take us back to the picture-shop at once. We will close up for the day until you do.” Then my eyes slily winked at eadi other and clapped tight shut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Nose,” screamed my legs m a rage, “smell out the grocery-bench at once! I wish to sit down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But my nose only turned up and replied: “What, that musty smelling store? I should say not!” Then it sniffed its disgust, and said: “Why did you stop near a dead cat? Take me back to the popcorn wagon at once—it smells so much nicer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I smell no dead cat,” said my legs stiffly. “It is your foolish imagination, and I shall stay right here until I know where the bench is. Ears, listen for a sound like a wooden bench, will you, and tell me what direction it comes from.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I will listen to nothing but the brass band,” said my ears, waxing very angry. Then they said, “I hear an automobile coming, and I should advise you to move with the utmost alacrity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Which way, which way!” cried my legs, becoming frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I am uncertain—you had better ask eyes,” said my ears. But my eyes refused to budge a lid. Then my legs began to run about every which way; and all of a sudden there was a tremendous crash, a nd myself was hurled-through the atmosphere and landed on the sidewalk. a complete wreck. My legs groaned: “I am broken in two places”; my eyes wept: &quot;I am black and blue”; my nose snuffled: “Take me away fom this gas—I am bleeding and suffocating”; and my ears drummed: “'What an awful noise—I’m sure I’m burst”. Likewise all my other members set up a tremendous wail in sr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">And so it came about that while </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> lay recuperating in the hospital, as soon as they were able all the mutinous members held a consultation, which resulted in their making overtures of peace to myself on terms which myself was only too glad to accept without reservations; and in accordance with which from thence forward, myself has always taken great pains to satisfy within reasonable bounds the desires and inclinations for recreation of all the various members of my body, who in turn render to myself with . utmost goodwill their services whenever required, so that we now live all together, a happy and a contented family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">E CAME West in 1908 to get us a home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We found we were five or six years too late to get homestead laud that, was worth taking; but about that time those that were proving up on their claims were selling them, as is usual with the first settlers in a new country. Proved-up land was selling for from fourteen hundred to two thousand a quarter, according to the location and the amount of saw timber on it</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">My son-in-law bought a claim for sixteen hundred from an old bachelor that had just proved up. He paid a few hundred down, and had five years to pay the balance in at eight percent interest We were told that the sawtimber on the land during the five years would sell for enough on the stump to pay for the place. Two or three lumber companies were operating in that section and had bought some state timbered lands and were buying some small tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">About that time, 1909 and 1910, the lumber business took a backset, and not much lumber was being sawed to ship. The lumber companies conceived the idea that instead of buying the timber of the settlers and having to remove it in a given time, most of those settlers would sell out to them sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The homesteaders had not cleared much land during their five years of homesteading and so could not raise a living; and, being quite poor, they had to go out to work to support their families. In many instances they had run behind through sickness or some other cause; and when they got their patents from the Government they often had to mortgage to some moneyed shark or local bank, paying the limit of twelve percent. They could borrow from eight to twelve hundred on their land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">All the time the settler was in hopes to sell his timber to pay off the mortage; but the lumber companies </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> buying no timber, knowing that sooner or later the settler would have to sell out. They had their &quot;cruisers&quot; (timber viewers) out estimating the timber ip the whole country, so that when the settlers had to sell as their mortgages became due the mills knew to a dollar what their timber wds worth in the tree. They would offer you for the land from eighty cents to one dollar a thousand &lt;m its value (land and all). In that way they got pretty nearly the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Those settlers that hung on and would not sell for a long time were finally obliged to. sell; for so many had moved away that in many communities there were not children enough to keep up the schools and the parents were not able to send theirs off to school. In .war times in some localities the lumber kings started to saw that . timber, but would not buy a five-foot stick from a settler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Now where they have slashed the timber </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and where' the old dry slashings are a menace to the country on accoun| of fires, they offer those lands and advertise very extensively how they will sell those lands bad: to the settlers for the same price or a little more and give ten years' time to pay for them. Why not? They got two or three times what the lands cost them out of the timber and to have six percent coming in on the land is a fine </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thing</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">And pray tell me how the poor fellow that has three or four hundred to pay down is going to make his payments, with no timber to sell to help while he is clearing those slashings and getting a start?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Many a man, after spending eight or ten years of the best of his life there in the woods, has come out with less money than he left the East with, and all the time the kept press are holding out inducements to people in the East to come and get a home; it is so easy.* My sonin-law went out into the prairie and worked by</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the year topay up on his place; and the hard work and Worry caused the death of his wife, just as the test payment was to be made. She left two little boys. It took three or four years for him to recuperate from that loss with the expense of his boys. He could not sell his place today for what it cost him......</span></p>

But now with hard times coming on and millions of that lumber on hand that was gotten out with high-priced labor (that they were so* cocksure the world was going to need, and the world does need it, but cannot buy it), the companies are dropping (you will see) in price. But don't think for a minute that they are selling below cost; for they are not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T LOOKS very much as though the financial interests of America, if not of the world, are pulling off the biggest steal in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Our recent terrible and sudden drop in prices was no natural economic event, but a well-laid plan; and we shall be badly fooled if we expect prices to rise again. The United States issued billions of dollars in bonds when prices were high and money cheap. These bonds had been gradually gravitating into the hands of the financial interests, but not quickly enough to suit their purpose, when came the order to retrench.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The banks called in their loans; and in order to pay them, people had to sacrifice their bonds and property for what they could get on a glutted market. Result, the interests got hold of the bonds at a big discount and at the same time cut prices to a low level, from -which they will never recover to any material extent. We may be sure that the interests will see to it that prices do not recover, because it is necessary to their scheme to hold prices down and thus enhance the value of the dollar. Prices being now approximately one-half of war prices, the bonds, which were issued during high prices, timber for that All over northern Idaho and eastern Washington are millions of cords of suitable timber for paper,-such as spruce, white fir, Jack or black pine, and other timber going to waste. This the settlers would be glad to cut and sell, but there are only two or three paper mills in the whole country. I know of one section in the Clearwater country in Idaho—a strip eight or ten miles long with.a stream running through the middle of it, where with very little expense it could be floated to the railroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I am not entering a complaint; for we people that discern the signs of the times’ expect it and rejoice in the fact thafciVis only a forerunner of the incoming kingdom of jour Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Hoping that this will-be. of some benefit to you, I ask you to excuse my writing with a pencil; but as I apa an old num, all crippled up with rheumatism, my Hinds all drawn out of shape, I can write only*with&amp; pencil are now worth in actual property twice as much as when they were issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Suppose a farmer sold a cow for $100 during the war and bought a bond. He became pinched by the sudden fall in prices and sold his bond to the bank at a discount, in order to get currency to run his farm. It is plain that the bond represents the worth of one cow minus the discount charged by the bank. Years pass, the bond becomes due, but the value of cows has dropped to $50 each; and it will take two cows to pay off that bond, not counting the interest. Of course the Government pays the bond off in money, but this money has to come from the people in taxes, and our farmer will have to part with -two cows in order to pay his share of the taxes which in turn pays off the bond. The holder of the bond loans the Government the value of one cow and gets in return the value of two cows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The example of the cow can be applied to every other commodity, which means that the final owners of the bonds will force the American people to pay them double the amount of actual value that was loaned during the period of high prices by the simple trick of restricting the amount of circulating medium (money) and forcing down prices.</span></p>

Editor: I am a constant reader of your wonderful little paper and look for it with greater interest than all my other papers, combined, and I take no less than twenty-five. I herewith submit an article for publication in your paper if it meets with your approval: prompted really by hearing a Bible student explain that the gentiles were eventually to succumb through being debauched by the Jews.* The fact that the Jews control the clothing business and are furnishing us with sissy clothing now worn by our men, and the demoralizing effect of the present-day picture-shows, makes it seem that this man knew what he was talking about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>x</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOULD AMERICA RETURN TO MANLY SPORTS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Quite frequently, of late, in the daily press there crops out a revival of antagonism to the art of self-defense, as evinced in the attempt to prevent the fistic encounter between Dempsey and Carpentier; while at the same time those self-same people condone and in fact encourage the most brutal game ever conceived by mortal </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">d—namely, foot-balL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In a boxing contest there is absolutely no intent, desire, or attempt upon the part of either contestant to maim or kill his antagonist. How about foot-ball? Statistics record one hundred deaths due to foot-ball to one in the fistic ring!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">As a foot-ball player, I know, you go after your opponents purposely to put them out of commission; and each year's death list, together with those maimed for life, goes to show they generally get what they go after!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Men place their lives in jeopardy when engaged in either sport; and yet, with ever present danger, should not either one or both be preferred to the English games of golf and tennis? Should sports be held out to young Americans that sap-manhood and create effeminacy? Before answering, reflect that we are moulding the character upon which the future greatness of our nation depends; therefore we foot-ball fans should not knock the fistic fans, nor should the fistic fans knock the foot-ball fans; nor should either knock the base-ball or any other fans, when such fans are advocating manly sports I</span></p>

In 1875 the English sparrow was brought into our country. Today what, as a result, has become of our native birds? Dead. - Even the little fighting wren went the way of our most beautiful songsters;-and so will go our sports if our press continues to play up golf and tennis on the front page of every paper in the country while they condemn our own American sports. The press in America today is not American, nor is it working for the best interests of America. It is all, for England. Nine-tenths of our news comes from London! Nine-tenths of the pictures or photos in our papers and magazines are of English lords, dukes, counts or no-accounts I</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Today Congress is busily engaged in passing appropriations of a magnitude that make the angels weep.- Meantime the common people of the United States and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cA</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> all the Allied countries are learning the bitter truth of how desperately they were lied to by artfid politicians, called statesmen, to induce participation in the late war “to create disarmment, and world-wide democracy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.” Is He moving for or against us when He permits the minds of our youth to become debauched, through mediums ? If so, then our only hope lies in our country becoming a country of amazons; otherwise we would have none to carry the arms and man the ships we are now providing; as the sissification of a nation is not conducive to the creation of men-of-war, but rather of S</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">HE-MEN!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Permit me to draw a few logical comparisons. Among others Napoleon drubbed the Germans who at that stage, man for man, were no match for the French. Then there evolved the so-called turners, a manhood practically invincible. These physical giants romped all over the French in 1870 and virtually wiped up the earth with those dancing, effeminate, absinthe-drinking Frenchmen. Then in turn came an era of sane frugal living in France, necessitated by the German indemnity they were forced to pay, developing once more the men who defended Verdun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. In these days, when rumors of trouble between us and Japan are multiplying and with good reason* judging from the Japs’ past history, should we be creating a future generation of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sissies 1</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Japan, meanwhile, is emulating the ~ .Germans with their gymnastic ideas, their broadsword and fencing, their jiu-jitsu, etc., creating the future conquerors of the world— The Yellow Peril — unless the Caucasian</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. nations get down to brass tacks!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t become angered when I say “sissies”. Golf and tennis are well and good for old men, . the idle rich, and nice young ladies; but do they make for red-blooded men such as are required to win battlqs and endure the hardships of cam-</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">'Where there is smoke will generally be found fire!* Permit me to draw your attention to the fire ds evinced by the smoke of our country to- -day, our idealisms, our ideals and our nice ladylike expressions. Our sissy men must express ' themselves in sissy words and phrases. Our statesmen have degenerated into word-mongers ' who frame up nice-sounding sentences with not an atom of sincerity back of them, only having in view the leading of the people into bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“ If our forefathers were to pass up or down the business thoroughfares of any city, town, or hamlet in the old U. S.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. nice lady-like features, while women posing for the same have their hair parted on the side, and wear men’s vests, coats, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The ways of the world are surely upside-down when women take on masculinity, and men become patron saints to effeminateness.</span></p>

Are we soon doomed to be morally considered as the French have been in the past! Is this to be our sojourning in Cann®, and are we to be corrupted as were the troops of Hannibal, and thus at last go down into defeat! God forbid! But according to the swift and exceedingly rapid drift it would seem to conservative observers we are fast approaching the ragged edge! Will a Demosthenes arise; and if arising shall we hearken to him, or are we, the greatest nation the world has ever known, doomed to go down to defeat through corruption, introduced by our enemies, who could conquer us in no other way!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Fynhanga of War Holdings Favored by High Officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Washington, May 26. — President Harding and his advisers are understood to favor the conversion of Allied debts to the United States into foreign bonds held directly by the American public in place of liberty bonds, as a solution of the foreign obligation problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The explanation was made by authorities, after the president had announced in New York city that he hoped “in a reasonable period we may change the form of these obligations and distribute them among all the citizens&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What the president and his advisers have in mind is a plan, being worked out gradually by the treasury experts, whereby liberty bonds, as they mature, can be replaced by bonds of foreign governments in debt to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">This would accomplish two highly desired ends, it la pointed out by economists in touch with the government. It will make foreign governments responsible directly to investors for credit, and, if the entire foreign obligation is converted, will reduce the taxes that the administration must levy by. more than $1,000,000,000 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I was just'Connecting this in my mind with the following statement published in The Golden Age of April 28, 1920, which reads, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“The European nations are in hard financial straits.

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ONSIDER the interest evil of today. In every nation of the world the rich get interest on alf they have, while the poor must pay it in rentals and on everything bought on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The country itself levies interest on all unpaid taxes and gives interest on all the rich man’s wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting.out in life most young men are without capital. Let one of them, with a young wife, go on a farm. For the first few years when they really need help and the poor young wife needs a nurse girl to assist her rear her babies, they are burdened with debt and needs must pay interest on everything they’ve got, and the poor young wife not only must go without the nurse girl, but must add her frail strength to the drudgery work of the farm. And besides all this, let some* misfortune overtake them; and they are driven from their homes, losing all they have paid,, even what they have spared out of their want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I. Donnelly in “Ctesar’s Column” writes thus :</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘•Interest on mo,ney is the root and ground of the world’s troubles. It puts one </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">position of safe</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ty while another is in a condition of </span><span class="font11">insecurity and thereby it at once creates a radical distinction in human society. The lender takes a mortgage on the borrower's land, or house, or goods. The borrower then assumes all the chances of life to repay the loan. If he is a farmer, he has to run the risk of the fickle elements. Bams may drown, droughts may burn up his crops. If a merchant, he encounters all the hazards of trade; the bankruptcy of other tradesmen, the hostility of the elements sweeping away agriculture, and so aifectimr commerce. If a mechanic, he is- still more dependent upon the success of all above him and the mutations of commercial prosperity. He may lose employment; he may be stricken; he may die. But behind ail-these stands the money-lender, in perfect security. Give a million of men and a hundred years of time, and the slightest advantage possessed by any one class among the million must result, in the long run, in the most startling discrepancies of condition. A little evil grows like a ferment, it never ceases to operate. Give one set of men in a community a- financial advantage over the rest, however slight, it may be almost invisible, and at the end of centuries that &lt;•!;■. &lt;&nbsp;-o favored will own everything and wreck the country. A penny they say put out </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font11">interest the day Columbus .-ailed from Spain, and cumi'eunded ever since, would amount now </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">(A. D. </span><span class="font11">1900) to more than all the assessed value of property, real, personal and mixed on the two continents of North and South America. Usury kills off the enterprising members of a community by bankrupting them, and leaves </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">only the very rich and the very poor. Every dollar the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">employers of labor pay to the money-lendvr. </span><span class="font11">has to come </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">, eventually oot^ef the pockets of the laborers. Usury is U therefore the cause of the first aristocracy, and out of ’ this grow all brother aristocracies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We quote from “Little Giant Cyclopedia”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">* ' &quot;The ethical sense of mankind saw at an early day the ' wrong of usury. The Mosaic law was very explicit on the subject. Cicero mentions that Cato, being asked what he though of usury, made no other answer to the ques. tion than by asking the person who spoke to him what he thought of murder. The Christian church in its early days and until the Middle Ages utterly forbade the exar<sup>+;</sup>r&gt;n of interest. In the reign of Edward VI a prohibitory Act was passed for the stated reason that the charging of interest was a ‘vice most odious and detestable and contrary to the Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at Gott”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">' The Popes were against the levying of interest, so were Martin Luther, Ruskin and many others; even Mahomet strictly forbade it .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In the laws of Go&lt;j is written, Leviticus 25: 35-38: “If thy brother be waxed poor and hia hand fail with thee, then thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a stranger or a sojourner.... [therefore every man must be a brother], thou shalt take no interest or increase, but fear thy God, that thy brother shall live with thee. Thou shalt hot give him thy money upon interest, nor lend him any victuals for increase. I am the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">' Lord your God.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">And the Prophet David, writes in Psalm 15: “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">* He that putteth not out his money to interest, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He . that doeth these things shall never be removed.” And the prophet writes in Ezekiel 18:8,9: “He that hath not given forth upon interest, - neither taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand fi;om iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man, hath walked in my statutes and hath kept mine ordinances to deal truly: he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Any one can work the interest question, with</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a fair degree of accuracy, by a very simple method. For instance, take any interest table and it will lie seen that $1 at 6 percent compound interest, becomes a little over $10 in 40 years. Thus $10 in 40 years becomes $100. Thus $L in 80 years becomes $100. Therefore for every 40 years add on a naught. Thus in 240 years (6 x . 40) $1 becomes ($1,000,000) a million dollars. Every bank, loan company, etc., that advances their capital even only six percent per year would have in 240 years a million dollars for every dollar they have; got today. One dollar in 640 years would give enough interest annually to buy up the whole world from pole to pole at one thousand dollarsan acre without touching one cent of the principal- When will this interest bubble burst? - &nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We print in pert from the “Twentieth Century, N. Y.” the following by H. C. Whitaker:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Had one «nt been toaMFld AD. 1, with </span><span class="font11">interest </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">being allowed atthe .safeof ^percent compound </span><span class="font11">yearly, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">then 1894 years later the aJOWtut due would be $8,497,840,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000/XM),000.000.000. -000 (8,497,840,000 deciHimui).

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But no land has ever withstood for long these ever increasing fortunes. Revolution or conquest has swept away in a single day fortunes that have taken many years to build up, and only too often with reigns of terror, bloodshed and anarchy. Such was the end of Egypt, Babylon, Jerusalem, Rome, France in 1800, and even Russia. Is anything going to happen to us?</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">G</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">OLDEN AGE No. 41 has arrived, and I notice that nearly the whole magazine is devoted to the exposure of the terrible crimes committed by the British Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Now I am not complaining, nor shall I enter a protest; for I know that the people of Great Britain are neither better nor worse that those of the United States. The only difference is that Great Britain has had the opportunities thrown across her path, and has taken advantage of them to build herself up and to become the greatest nation the world has. ever had, while the United States is mad because she cannot do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">So poor old England has to be lambasted from</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">every quarter of the globe, particularly by the Irish, her nearest neighbors. Now if England would only submit to the Pope, the man on the Tiber, war in Ireland would end immediately. Therefore the trouble in Ireland is purely a matter of religion. The Boman Catholics want to get control so as to be able to oust the Orangemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Boer war in South Africa, you will remember how our papers were full of propaganda (Irish and German) of the cruelties practiced upon the poor Boers. I have a brother who was in the Transvaal all during the war; and he claims that the British treated the Boers </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">too well.</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> The British fed and cared for the Boer women and children, and after the war was ended they restocked the farms and practically rebuilt the country. 'Many, in fact nearly all, of the Boers are now friends of the British. Note that General Smuts and others who were foremost in the fight on the side of the Boers are now British patriots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">My brother is now in Eureka. One day recently he picked up Golden Agb No. 38 and read the article about the British doings in Palestine. He laid the magazine down and said: “I will never read The Golden Age again; they are Sinn Feiners.&quot; I think myself that No. 41 would sell well among the Irish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scriptures say: “Speak evil of no man”; and our dear departed Pastor said that we should not speak evil of our neighbors, even though it be the truth. Are not nations our neighbors, and is it necessary to berate other nations in order to make our calling and election sure! Is that kind of work to be the work of the feet members of the body of Christ!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">My brother also said: “That is why I am British—the way they treated a foe. I am proud of the British. I lived among them for twenty-five years, and I ought to know.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I believe that the British Empire is filling her part in the Divine Plan of the Ages. She has pioneered and also exploited countries, and has made it possible for the Bible to reach the different peoples of the world, and also made possible the entrance of the demijohn and other vices. It has fallen her lot to do so. Other nations, including our country, are merely jealous because they have not the power to do that same thing. Selfishness is the great curse of all peoples, including the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What we need is Messiah’s kingdom, described in God’s Word. His rule will be that of justice and equity, and will give a fair opportunity to the poor and needy. His kingdom will subdue evil, will crush it out, and will punish sinners, both rich and poor. His kingdom will “lay righteousness to the line and justice to the plummet&quot; and &quot;will sweep away the refuge of lies&quot; and subterfuges under which injustice is now so often cloaked. No wonder the Scriptures tell us that Messiah’s kingdom is &quot;the desire of all nations”!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">[There is no wrong in pointing out the transgressions of a government; it is quite proper that the people should know of such wrongs, if they exist, as it enables them to pray more intelligently, “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven&quot;. It is folly to teach and preach that present governments are parts of Christ’s kingdom; they are part and .parcel of Satan’s empire, now falling into ruins. In the fourth volume of his Scrip-tube Studies Pastor Russell spoke as plainly on these subjects as The Golden Age has ever done; and throughout the years of his connection with the Watch Towee, of which he was editor, he periodically called attention to items such as we discuss in The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We hold no brief for any earthly government; if they have the spirit of Christ let them show it and we will rejoice; if they have the spirit of Satan we will point it out and rejoice that their time is short; so we rejoice anyway. We try to be impartial. Britishers are human; they do not like to have their government criticized; Americans are the same. We could fill The Golden Age with witless, pointless, entertaining matter such as abounds in publications everywhere, but we think it more worth while to lay a generous supply of facts on all subjects before our readers and let them form some intelligent conclusions as to the real conditions about us. In the end they will thank us for swimming against the stream]</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By John H. G. Snoic (Montreal')</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">HOUGH a natural-born Britisher I was greatly struck with the truth and its fair presentation in the article, “Earth’s Greatest Empire’*, my only defense of my kinsmen according to the flesh being the Scriptural declaration throughthe Prophet* Isaiah 9:16, “For the leaders of this people cause them to err, and the people who are called blessed of them are swallowed up” (Margin).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">As a boy I was taught the soul-inspiring doctrine that one Englishman was worth so many of this nationality and so many of that nationality, that the gentry had blue blood in their veins and divine right from the king down to some imaginary line below the clergy, of course, but never yet explained, because, as the Apostle Paul declares, it never existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“God hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the whole earth.” (Acts 17:26) How could all be made of one and yet some have become sacred, and when did this mysterious, change take place, are questions all might well ask, and the answer is found in the words of our Lord Jesus (Revelation 2:2) “Thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I append an imaginary dialogue between Jesus and the theologians of our day, which indicates a few of the many ways in which teachers of today have strayed from the truth.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jesus: “Call no man your father upon </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">earth; for one [not three] is your Father who is in heaven, and all ye are brethren.&quot;—Matthew 23:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy : &quot;Call us your holy fathers and your right reverend fathers in God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jesus: “My Father is greater than L”— John 14:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy : “Oh, no! You are equal in power.” . Jesus: -T am the beginning of the creation of God.”—Revelation 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy: &quot;No! You are the Son uncreate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jesus: “Of that day and hour knoweth no man.’’—Mark 13:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy: &quot;You do know and always did know all things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jesus: &quot;Worthy is the Lamb to receive power.”—Revelation 5 :12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy; “You always did.have all power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jesus : “My Father and I are two that bear witness.”—John 8:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Clergy : “You forget about the Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Irish Question Once More </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Newton T. Hartshorn</span></h4>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Y</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OU</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> ask; “Why don't the Irish fight square, not from behind hedges!&quot; You give them 100,000 rifles with munitions and ten batteries of modern guns with munitions, and they will give gll the square fight desired. I spent a year in Ireland and carefully studied the Irish question. It is not a local question. It is a world question. It is precisely the same question that in 1776 led the American colonies to rebel a-gainst British imperial tyranny. It is the great cause of human freedom and justice against the damnable spirit of imperialism that assumes to boss the whole world by a few for the benefit of a few, and the Irish today are putting up a fight for the God-given right of human justice and liberty. I am glad that the German imperialism got its finish; British imperialism next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">While I know that the Irish Catholics are vindictive to the last degree, yet like Paul before his conversion they are red-hot when they </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> they are right There is something in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Irish character that I admire. During all these long years of crushing oppression they have refused to lie down at the crack of the British whip. When they once get their eyes opened to the falseness of Romanism, they will be as earnest as Paul was after his conversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Things are shaping up, lining up against the Image of the Beast. The Pope, to save his s</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">, is taking the side of British imperialism. The Irish have given notice that they will take no politics from Rome. The Irish bishop that issued the pastoral letter threatening excommunication of those who engaged in Irish ambushes found his churches deserted. I believe that the Irish will prove to be the eunuchs that will throw Jezebel out of the window—but I may be wide of the mark. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it proper for a saint to come out boldly against injustice wherever it shows up! Our Lord told Pilate that His kingdom was not of this world. Times have changed. We believe that Christ's- kingdom is now in a sense at least beginning to be set up, and in that sense His kingdom is of this world; and while it would be both unwise and abortive, in fact wrong, to take sides in the politics of this expiring world,, yet sympathy it seems to me may be expressed with those who are unjustly treated, whether they be Catholics, Protestants, Mohammedans or Jews. At any rate, from a careful study of the Irish question, I came years ago to sympathize with the Irish, with supreme love for the truth and all who have the same love for what is just and right, be they English, Irish, German, Chinese, French or Italian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Sinking of the Lusitania </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Robert Ranson (Florida)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;DROBABLY no 3 ne happening of the World * War made so deep an impression on the world as the sinking of the British steamer Lusitania in May, 1915, at which time 119 Americans lost their lives. At that time,, if you remember, we were constantly told that we must be neutral . even in our thoughts, and that the destruction of Belgium and of northern France and its architectural gems was no concern of ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In October, 1910, it was my privilege to make ' a trip to England on this noble boat, at that time I think the largest afloat, except her sister ship the Mauretania. I had crossed the Atlantic five times previously on other boats, and had voyaged round the world in the old days when the voyage to and from Australia and New Zealand took from one hundred and twenty days to six months, according to the winds encountered. I was thus no stranger to oeean travel; but my trip on the Lusitania will ever be one of the pleasantest recollections of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">She was at that time the fastest, best warmed and ventilated and the most comfortable ship it has ever been my good fortune to -sail on. I loved that boat from the time I set foot on her till I left; and I often wonder how my beautiful cabin looks today, occupied as it probably is with sea monsters and possibly the remains of some unfortunate victims, at the bottom of the deep Atlantic about 35 miles off the coast of Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. My first impression on looking over the ship was the awful scarcity of lifeboats and liferafts ; and in consultation with a friend we decided, after a careful once over, that in case of a wreck not over eight hundred out of the total of twenty-eight hundred souls on board could possibly escape a watery grave. Nobody worried, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The next thing we noted was that every officer and all of the crew had on their &lt;&nbsp;ap&gt; the mystic letters R. N. R. (Royal Naval Reserve) On asking the meaning of this we were informed that the British government had subscribed onefourth of her total cost, about half a million pounds, so that in case Great Britain ever went to war this ship and its entire crew would be </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ipso facto</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> a unit of the British Navy. Every sailor on board was in fact a naval man, and had served his time in the navy; and a finer lot of boys I never saw on any transatlantic steamer, quite different from the ordinary deck-swabbers that usually make up the crew of this class of passenger vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The interest in the trip was further heightened by finding an old friend on board, Lord Northcliffe, whom I had met in his humbler Harmsworth days in Florida. On the second . day out his name was published in a supplementary passenger list, it not having appeared in the first one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After reading it I gave my card to the purser and told him to take it to Lord Northcliffe’s room and request an interview for me. The purser seemed to have that inherited dread of a real live lord that afflicts most of his race and told me two or three times: “I don’t know whether ‘me lud’ could see you or not”; so I . told him the best way to settle his doubts on the matter was to try to find out Finally he summoned up sufficient courage to tap at the door of the great newspaper man's apartments and handed in my card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Instead of shrivelling me with a glance the noble lord called out; “Hello, Ranson! How are you ? Come in! How did you know that I was on the ship?” I informed him that his name was on a supplementary passenger list; and he said: “Durn it! I told them not to publish my name.” I asked: “Why didn't you want your name published?” “Well,” be replied: “You know these American reporters, and what a bore they are.&quot; I said: “Well, you ought to be willing to take your own medicine”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">, <sub>y</sub> ,<sub>;</sub>. ajwi. W^TO .told that the great ship was divided ‘,<sup>:</sup><sub>v</sub> &lt;infe&gt; twenty-four water-tight compartments di, tided one from the other by a water-tight sliding <sub>;</sub> door; that each one or all of these could be immediately closed in case of accident; that any</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">, six compartments could be broken from the outside and d»e rest would prevent her from sinking; and that in fact the vessel could be cut in - two and the two halves would dost long enough &quot;&nbsp;till they got assistance to prevent any loss of life. Of course her construction was known to all marine engineers, and the point I have to make later in this connection will then be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">. I may pass over the wonderful engines, etc., etc.; for in a few days we sighted the coast of Wales and stopped off Fishguard to send the mails and London passengers ashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Thirty-two thousand sacks of mail were put off into two good-sized steamers, and as we saw ■ling after sling go over the side it seemed as if it would sink the tenders. The rest of the trip to Liverpool was uneventful and would have remained a pleasant memory the balance of my life and possibly not written about or referred to, had it not been for the shocking news communicated to me one night after I had retired that she had been sunk by a submarine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Possibly a month later I began to worry about not having Received any answer to an important letter I hatf written to England, and it suddenly ■truck me that probably my letter went down in the Lusitania and was never delivered in England at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">With this thought in mind and remembering what a powerful mail-carrier she was, I wrote to the Cunard Company in New York and asked them whether much mail had been lost at the time of her sinking and whether any of it had been recovered. Their answer was that on her</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">last trip she had carried only ninety-seven sacks of mail and only that mail specially addressed by the senders to go on that boat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Now comes the summary: If one department of the United States government took so much stock in the warning that the ship would be sunk that they (the P. O. authorities) would not send the mails in her, why did not some other department of the government forbid the company to carry a shipload of innocent passengers on a vessel carrying arms and ammunition, a boat advertised to be a unit of the British navy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Every wireless man on the coast knew that the German wireless at Sayville was reporting day by day the-progress of the ill-fated ship to German submarines hidden under the west coast of Ireland, but we were neutral and allowed this villainy to proceed unhampered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In February, 1918, you will remember that Woodrow Wilson sent out the various members of his cabinet on a lecturing tour round the country to tell us why we had entered the war; and Secretary Houston, among other remarks made in Morocco Temple, Jacksonville, Florida, before eighteen hundred people said: “They say the Lusitania carried arms and ammunition, which she had a perfect right to do”. Did she ? This vessel like all others was subject to U. S. inspection, and no passenger boat is allowed to carry even a can of gasoline or a box of dynamite under these same regulations. Any breach &gt;&nbsp;of this rule would be instantly followed by a loss of license to all the officers and a heavy fine or confiscation of the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">This explains the motto on the medal struck by Germany after the loss of the Lusitania, one of which is in my possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“GESCHAEFT UBER ALLES!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Trade above all things.” After a fair warning that any further shipments of arms and ammunition would not be permitted if a submarine could stop her, and so much stock taken in it that no mails were sent, hundreds of people, many of them women and babes, went down to a watery grave and the Cunard Co. had their pas-age money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Not long before this a British ship carried some millions of gold to Canada and was convoyed by six British warships: but this leviathan crowded with precious human lives was allowed to be sunk and no helping hand in sight</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I am sometimes tempted to ask whether the British authorities wanted to see her sunk to drag fls finally into the war! Anyway it made u«&gt; impression bn Woodrow Wilson; for he was neutral and told us that we must be, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Both in history and on the screen one fact stands out, that when the captain of the sub saw what he had done and that mass of struggling humanity going down to death, he became a raving maniac. Accepting as a fact that it was outside of the limit of possibility to sink such a ship with one torpedo, and that all they could hope </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> accomplish was to stop it till help came along, and, thus to frighten others from coining across in ammunition-laden vessels, is it reasonable to suppose that he would ever have fired even that one shot it he had dreamed of such awful consequences?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I cannot think of any happening in all history so awful in its results that with ordinary caution might have been so easily avoided. If such an act. committed as it was on the high seas, had been avenged upon the seas by our navy, we might easily have been spared sending our boys to fight land battles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What more suitable motto could have been thought .of than &quot;BUSINESS ABOVE ALL THINGS”!</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> LADY here told me last night that one of the big moneyed men of this place landed three large boats yesterday before sunrise. The common small dealers do not dare come inside the three-mile limit; but this man came right into one of thesp small wharfs where we go to fish., bringing on each boat over three-thousand cases of whiskey. The man who takes the job of running boats gets ten dollars a case, so you can see what a man makes on one trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">‘•This comes from Bimmy or Nassau, but this is not the only source. I heard a man who is a Cuban and a Tram man on the Florida East Coast, ask Mrs.----for a bit of advice. He said</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">that he had a chance to make some money and to! Her that the chance was to run a good big ! &lt;&gt;at over to Cuba and bring booze to Key We.&lt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Ure he now runs trams. He told her that the man was going to give him five dollars a case. &gt;•. -aid: 'Don't do it. Make them give you ten ■ r don't take it/</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">This lady told me that one of her sons had jit't &gt;v!&lt;i fifteen hundred for a boat and was going to make his first trip on it in about a week. Another son had just got back from California (where he took a fortune made from this traffic) without a cent in his pocket. She has a young son who has no other business than ‘boot-legging’. I don’t suppose you know what that means, so I will tell you. He is the Zone man who handles the booze; he gets it for five and sells it for eight to a R. R. man who takes it to Jax and sells it for fifteen. He tells people here in the hotel that he will go down street and get booze; but he goes out into his back yard and digs down in the sand and gets it for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“A lady here told me that she did not always live on Easy street, but that her husband made one thousand dollars a week in the whiskey business. .. .The train men... .get the whiskey for $3.00 and sell it for $15.00.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">[Ex-bartenders and other bums, according to our information, are now making fortunes carrying booze around the country in hand satchels. They have regular routes. Strange thing that these bright secret-service men cannot find them. Those brave men had no difficulty in finding Bible students in war time and hesitated not at perjury to land them in prison for life. New York city became so disgusted at the connivance of the federal detectives with the lawbreakers that the New York police got after the law-breakers and arrested more than a thousand of them </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in one week]</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">MOVING tale of the self-sacrificing beehive bee reaches me from a bee-keeper on a Scottish loch. His hives are on the more barren side of the water; and the bees, in their zeal for the flowers that scent the opposite hillside, fly in battalions across the loch. The journey has no terrors. They are light on the wing, excited by the sweet perfume, and eager— so eager—that when the scented sb.ores are reached, they pack their furry thighs with pollen or load up with honey to their utmost power. But to gather the spoil is one tiling, and to return with it another. One bee alter another, tired and heavy laden, falls out and drops with his load into the water. So gr. at are the casualties that the swarms could bo saved only by moving the hives so that little or no water separates them from the largess 01 blossom and the irresistible scent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Goodly sums are lavished on the deceased pets of the wealthy, graves costing $2.50 per square foot, most graves averaging $15; and there are special plots costing $2,000 to $5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a cosily furnished rest room, the walls of which are hung with pictures of the deceased pets, among them that of a $3,000 monkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The bodies of the pets are shipped to- the cemetery in zinc-lined boxes, usually by express. They are placed in a receiving vault until the caretaker is notified when the family will arrive to witness the interment The bereaved ones, . especially the adult and male members of the </span><span class="font11">f</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">amil</span><span class="font11">y, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">often exhibit much feeling and shed many tears as the body of the pet is lowered into the -ground.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">SAW in The Golden Age of April 27 an * article on “How Vaccines Work”, by G. del Pino, Glasgow. Believing that the old is passing and that the new is coming in, I wish to tell the readers of The Golden Age what the new schools of natural healing have to<sub>s</sub> say about vaccines. The following is a copy from one of their, books:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Diphtheria Antitoxin: The first case of diphtheria was reported from Roven, a small town in southern France, about fifteen years after they had started to vaccinate in that locality. Since that time diphtheria has followed vaccination faithfully from one country to another all over the face of- the earth. These claims have been frequently ridiculed and condemned as utterly groundless and preposterous by advocates of vaccination. Now comes Dr. Tenison Deane of San Francisco, a representative in good standing of the allopathic school of medicine, and confirms the contention concerning the true cause of diphtheria, in a book entitled, &quot;The Crime of Vaccination”. The author subscribes himself as follows: A police surgeon, S. F. Asst. Surgeon S. F. Emergency Hospital; Adjunct to Chair Surgery, Post Graduate School of Medicine, U. of CaL; Asst. Skin and Venereal Clinic, S. F. Polyclinic; Prof. Surgery, Pacific Coast Regular College of Medicine; Lecturer on Surgical Pathology and Bacteri-ology.etc. His attainments entitle him to a respectful hearing from believers in vaccination, his strong attaiiQnents should brace up the weakkneed opponents of vaccination and determine them to protect themselves and their families at any cost from the fearful hazards of this practice. We are taught by him, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">reader must note, that the immediate effects of vaccination are nothing compared with the latent and lasting ones. The extracts from the book quoted bring home the fact that health boards and vaccination doctors are sowing disease of the worst forms. Tn Chapter TV is the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;••</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">History op a Case : As one that started him on his investigatioa and study of the subject June 15, 1889, the author was spending his vacation on the ranch of a wealthy farmer in the northern part of the state of California, fifteen miles from the nearest town, a farm of 10,000 acres and no </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ediate neighbors. The farmer had a wife and seven children. The foreman, a negro, had a wife and five children. None had ever been vaccinated. Six of them were selected and vaccinated by the author: the farmer's wife, age 43 years; the farmer's daughter, age 6 years; the farmer's son, age 8 years; the farmer’s son, age 25 years; the negro foreman, age 46 years; his son, age 12. All the rest were left out, and were not afterwards vaccinated. On August 1, 1890, the farmer, his wife, and five children went to the mountain ranch forty miles away, taking with them the.foreman, his wife, and five children. There had been no diphtheria in the town nor any in their neighborhood. The mountain ranch was an uninhabited virgin pine forest district, with pure water, where they took up their camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">August 24 an epidemic of sore throat and canker sores developed among the children: farmer’s daughter, seven years old, son nine years old. and the foreman’s son, thirteen years old. &lt;b v*4o|»&lt;'d wry serious throat and constitutional symptoms, and were taken to the home ranch, where a doctor was setat for. Diphtheria was the diagnosis. The farmer’s wife also de--veloped diphtheria. All the rest who had not been vaccinated were cured rapidly of their sore throats. The farmer’s daughter, seven years old, died. The farmer’s son, nine years old, did not recuperate for one year. The farmer’s wife, forty-four years old, had paralysis and sequel®, which lasted over one year. The foreman’s son, thirteen, became very weak and did not return to normal health. In 1893 the fanner’s son, twenty-nine years old, died in Los Angeles, California, of tubercular intestinal trouble; in 1900 the foreman at fifty-seven died of tubercle or cancer of larynx; in 1902 the foreman’s son, twenty-five, died of tuberculosis; in 1909 the farmer’s wife, aged 63, died of cancer; in 1911 the farmer’s son, aged thirty, died of tubercular meningitis; the farmer died of old age. All the rest are living and in perfect health, nor have they ever been vaccinated. No tuberculosis has shown in any of those living, nor is there any family history of tuberculosis. All who were vaccinated in 1889 are now dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">BUSINESS GOES BRISKLY FORWARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of the foregoing, what unutterable silliness the present anti-tuberculosis crusade and the elaborate cancer research! On these millions are spent yearly, countless dumb brutes are tortured, aud human being are experimented on with every nostrum conceivable to modern medicine; and all the while the state manufacture of cancer and consumption, as well as of other diseases, goes briskly forward. It is a tragedy repeating itself year after year, as people are forced to be vaccinated on various pretexts—school attendance, the chance to earn your bread, to go about your business—these are made dependent on getting vaccinated whenever the health boards see tit to order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus, one after another, the claims of naturecure philosophy are verified by new discoveries of scientists of the regular school of medicine. The medical profession takes the stand that it is their business to cure the people, not to educate them. Students are taught in medical schools not to talk too much, to maintain a dignified professional silence, etc. The great revolutionary di.-eovevies were made outside the medical profession, by pioneers of natural healing—by such men as Hensel, Schuessler, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Lehman—and are not according to the opinions of the scribes of the schools. 'Nothing good can come out of Nazareth’; even though they did know, they would not impart their knowledge to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a matter of government record in the agricultural department in Washington that the two great epidemics of hoof-and-mouth disease in 1902 and 1907 were caused by vaccines imported from Germany and Japan. It is strange that we cannot produce enough of the filthy stuff in this country. The reports in the daily papers at that time read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“The first cows exhibiting the disease had been </span><span class="font11">placed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">pens in the Detroit </span><span class="font11">stock </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">yards, which </span><span class="font11">previously were </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">occupied by vaccine calves, that is, calves that </span><span class="font11">had been </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">used on the H. K. Mulford farm far the </span><span class="font11">production of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">vaccine. After the suspicions of the government </span><span class="font11">officials, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">who investigated the origin of the epidemic, </span><span class="font11">had been </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">aroused, they procured vaccine produced </span><span class="font11">from these </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">calves and inoculated it into other cattle. </span><span class="font11">These test </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">animals broke out with hoof-and-mouth disease, </span><span class="font11">leav</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ing no doubt about the fact that the vaccine </span><span class="font11">produced </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">from these calves contained the germs of </span><span class="font11">this horrible </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">disease. In the meantime the poisonous stuff </span><span class="font11">was being </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">- inoculated into hundreds of thousands of school </span><span class="font11">chil</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">dren and adults all over the country. Not </span><span class="font11">the least </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">remarkable part of this story lies in the fact that </span><span class="font11">these </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">calves, after they had been saturated with the </span><span class="font11">smallpox </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">taint so thoroughly that they had become </span><span class="font11">useless for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">further production of vaccine, were sent by the </span><span class="font11">million</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">aire owners of these vaccine farms to the </span><span class="font11">stockyards </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to be sold in the meat markets and to be </span><span class="font11">foisted on the public as veaL It seems strange that these- wealthy firm.’ had not decency enough to bury the disease-contaminated </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">carcasses of the vaccine calves in quick lime. </span><span class="font11">These are the people who pose as the guardians of the public health, who produce hundreds of poisonous antiseptics to prevent infectious and contagious diseases?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The reports about this matter from the government department in Washington appeared in the Chicago daily papers of May 17, 1909, and then were promptly quashed. To whose interest was it to muzzle the press thus instantaneously? Why were those responsible for these outrages not prosecuted for foisting such unclean, disease-contaminated food on the public ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">These, as well as many similar occurrences, prove positively that the so-called anti-smallpox vaccine is not pure smallpox virus, but a mixture of all systemic poisons and disease taints in the body of the animal from which the vaccine has been produced. According to the law of counter-irritation, all constitutional poisons and disease taints in the body of an animal or a human being try to work out through the vaccination sore. From this it becomes apparent that there is no more efficient method for the wholesale propagation of disease taints than through vaccination. Children have inherited enough disease taints from their fathers’ and mothers’ families without inoculating into them the tuberculosis, venereal, or other taints of the Jones and Miller families or of disease-infected cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Humanity was never obsessed by a darker superstition than that health can be promoted by making human bodies swill-pots for the col-. lection of all kinds of virulent poisons, vaccines, serums, antitoxins, and other disease taints. Smallpox, if treated in a natural way, like all other acute diseases, leaves the - system in a purer and healthier condition. Some of the worst defectives, such as epileptics and paralytics, were directly the result of vaccination and of diphtheria antitoxin treatment. To become immune to disease we must purify our bodies through the right natural method of living and pure diet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">F A cow, at death’s door, be restored to health by the introduction of medicine through the navel and navel-string, why should not other </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mammal</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">s be successfully treated in similar </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mann</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ar t</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In what I have to present there is no &quot;if’. My most valuable Jersey cow had gorged on frozen pumpkins and miscellaneous contents of a garbage-can, and was violently sick. A helpful village neighbor, owner of a milk herd—just a plain man—came on request to my aid, to assist, if he could. He placed his hand on her - back, the cow being too sick to notice him, though a stranger to her, and inquired for a tablespoon and a vial of spirits of turpentine. When I returned with pure turpentine, direct to me from the distillery, he held the spoon toward me and commanded, “Pour it full&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Aftar I had poured, he held the tip of the spoon a</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">gains</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">t the cow’s navel; and as he slowly raisad the handle its entire contents disappeared into the cow’s body. He extended his arm and commanded, “Pour it full again”; and, behold, the second spoonful passed upward, out of sight, as before. Not a drop fell to the ground, it being broad daylight—the cow standing in the open upon two inches of new, light snow upon which a single drop would have made an impression. And my wife was witness. Surely, not two minutes time was consumed in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> a</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">dminis</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">tration of the turpentine. Turning to me, my neighbor quietly murmured: &quot;I think </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">t your cow will show improvement by tomorrow&quot;. So she did, and she remained well thereafter. What attraction or force, pray, caused the liquid to mount upward into the cow’s body—pump, syphon, absorption! Surely not absorption; for the operation was too speedy; and as for the other two, impossible. Can the philosophy of this phenomenon be explained, and is it broadly significant, suggesting a new channel for administering treatment to all mammalia, including man!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I can make affidavit to what-1 have told and give names, the locality, etc. I can also add that my wife’s niece has since cured her daughter’s cow, after hearing of my experience. But why so, seriously! This may be an old practice or, if new, of little account</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">We were taught that the navel string is of no use after a mammal’s birth; but after the experience given above I realize, and with new emphasis, that a mammal is developed in the foetus, its entire organism formed, through the navel-string as a channel; and I can but inquire inwardly if this man-relegated appendage may not prove to be a valuable channel, or the channel, through which all parts of the human body may be reached by medicines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Some reader, with better qualifications than mine, may be able to analyze and exploit the question; and for that purpose I write. Treatments are now administered variously through mouth, stomach, lower bowel, lungs, skin and blood-vessels (by direct infusions), etc. How about the navel-cord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">READY MEANS FOB MEDICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Some, or many, readers of The Golden Age confidently look for the early realistic fulfillment of tiie promise, &quot;He healeth all thy </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">dia</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">-eases”. Reader, I would have no one think me over-serious, unbalanced, or'frivolous in making reference tothe marginal reading of Proverbs 3:8 in this connection. (“It shall be medicine to thy navel*) An apparent isolated or detached Scriptural text should not be presumptuously employed to bolster up one fact, to the establishment of a system. But the wise man’s allusion may not be altogether pointless, or unrelated, in this very instance, as we are nearing the &quot;due time”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Drift of Modern Education By </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">e.</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Coffey</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE past half-century has witnessed wonder-ful strides in the educational progress of this and other nations of earth. A majority of this generation’s great-grandfathers were illiterate men, unable to read or even to sign their own name. During their lives, however, education progressed rapidly, and most of our grandfathers learned to read and.write; but only the favored few received more than a rudimentary education in these fundamentals. During the &quot;seventies” rapid strides were made in all. branches of human learning and skill, and most of our fathers received some tutelage in a few of the branches of science. Yet the instruction they received was quite inferior to the still greater knowledge imparted to us of today. We of this generation have been favored above all other generations. Yet so ungrateful are we for bounties bestowed that our. superior knowledge and learning has grown. commonplace, and we attribute it all to evolution of the human species—a false theory concocted by followers of &quot;science falsely so-called”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been truthfully said that the wants, desires and cravings of humankind know no bounds. With a sincere desire for the advance of the human race as a whole, the cry for education was first sounded by compatriots of the rank and file and in various countries. Our own land, the birthplace of progressive democracy, sounded the clarion note that bade the common people awake from slumber. Common schools were established at the birth of our country,, and have progressed with national growth. From that time on, the cry has always and ever been, “More colleges and better schools&quot;. But it has taken a long while to arouse the masses to concerted action. In the past the attitude of the common people toward education was passive. But today, as never before, parents are insisting upon education, and their children are demanding it. The slogan now is for higher education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">For a time the country people were content with the primitive one-room schoolhouse, with its yearly session of four or five months; but this no longer satisfies. Where the population is sufficiently dense, the rural districts continue to consolidate and erect rural high schools. On the other hand vast numbers of people are migrating from the more sparsely settled communities to the larger tows where there are first-class high schools. But the high-school education is not deemed^Suflfclent; and hordes of ambitious youths froth the country, town and city are overflowing our many colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">But, the thinking man inqtuLres, whither is this mania for edqpation and'higher learning tending! Whither are-W», drifting! In order to get our bearings we inquire into w'hat is being taught our aspiring youths of today. An investigation of the text-books used in our common spools reveals the fact- that evolution, higher criticism, and other false theories at variance wi,th the clear-cut teachings of the Bible, are instilled into the youthful mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOLISHNESS </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or THE LBABNED</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">For example, the histories all represent man as progressing from the savage or cave-man upward, ignoring entirely the Genesis account of man’s creation and subsequent fall from his original perfection. Geographies and other science text-books vie with each other in seeking to substantiate the foregoing. The Bible is lightly referred to as one of the many legendary histories preserved from antiquity. Thus irreverence for God’s Holy Word is encouraged. In the primary grades fables and myths are presented in the readers, teaching the immortality of the soul and other false theories of churchianity. Thus has Satan been transformed, as the Scriptures foretold, into &quot;an angel of light”; and his original lie perpetuated throughout Christendom. But this wave of enlightenment is having another effect. The people are awakening to the injustices of our day: and thus is hastened the destruction of our false systems of church and !»tffte—- the drift of modern education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ’ <sup>;</sup></span></p>

Type of earthly governments under authority of Satan, the ruler of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tflia</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hbbodias: Who had become unfaithful to her first husband in order to become Herod's wife. Type of church, which became unfaithful to Christ in order to become wedded to the pagan Roman empire as state church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Salome: Daughter of Herodias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Type of Protestantism, daughter of Papacy, the &quot;Mother Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">John the Baptist: Type of the true church, which condemns the union of church and state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hebod’s Supper: Feast at close of day. The World War at close of gentile day. Every war during last century has been a great feast to the real rulers and princes of this age — the money lenders, merchants, and manufacturers, particularly to those dealing in war materials. The Morgan Company, New York, is estimated to have increased their wealth by $5,000,000,000 the first three years of the war, through financing loans and commission on purchases for Allies, the greatest increase being due to the rise in price of stocks in various industries, profiting by increased sales at war prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">profitable “banking&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Note: The Morgan firm was made American purchasing agents for the Allies at the outbreak of war, and made it a rule not to let a contract to any firm until they had bought the bulk of its capital stock; and when the fabulous profits, on war contracts, had boosted the price of stock high enough to make a profitable sale, they sold out and repeated the performance with other firms. This continued during the war; and when it is realized the vast capital this firm controlled before the war, the estimated profits of $5,000,000,000 may be less than half of actual war profits. The Morgan firm received $300,000,000 in capital stock for organizing the Steel Trust, $25,000,000 for organizing shipping combine and like commissions for organizing scores of large corporations since 1900. The profits on - those holdings alone, from rise in price, would far exceed the billion-dollar mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Herodias did not dance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">21-28 </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ByG.Westlin</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholics the world over opposed the war, the Catholic hierarchy realizing from experience that wars these days tend to destroy the last remaining vestige of feudalism, the social order under which Catholicism developed and thrived so well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Salome danced: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Protestant churches almost without exception welcomed and supported the war, which without their sanction and support could neither have been begun nor conducted by Central powers or Allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dance pleased Herod: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">No Government could fail to be pleased with such support, or would refuse suitably to reward even to giving them a part in making and enforcing the laws (especially war-time legislation). Mark 6:23: “Whatsoever thou shalt ask of mel will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom&quot; (church-state power, prohibition, blue Sundays, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Salome asks Herodias' advice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Protestantism copies Papacy’s system of suppressing free speech, free press, free assemblage. Protestant churches demand that religious truth injurious to their plans be suppressed by banning such books and literature as expose the truth too clearly to be openly denied by them, the writings of Pastor Russell in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Herod was sorry:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The statesmen and politicians, at the head of the Allies in particular, trying to justify their participation in the war by claiming that it was waged to defend and promote liberty and democracy, were reluctant to deny their lofty sentiments of political and industrial democracy, and by unconstitutional acts suppressed freedom of speech, press and assemblage. “But. .for the sakes of them that sat with him.” Under the pressure of profiteering financiers, merchants and manufacturers, the politicians surrendered to the demands of the clergy and did what had never before been attempted in America, interfered in religious worship and suppressed religious books and periodicals, forbidding religious worship and imprisoning people for their religious views.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.: He did not, but said on the contrary </span><span class="font11">(Romans </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">6:23): &quot;The wages of sin is death, but the gift of </span><span class="font11">God </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord”.</span></p>

MIXER VILL, FNDIANA, Jan. 14, 1882. 

"ZION'S WATCH TOWER"-My dear good friends:-Your kind 
favor, "Food for Thinking Christians," reached me in due time. To 
say that it is an exceeding welcome gift but feebly expresses my 
appreciation and gratitude. I have learned what I never knew 
before, and it has brought to me such a flood of light that I am 
amazed at the grandeur of the scheme and plan of redemption. To 
allow the phrase, I have literally devoured it, and my soul is 
ravished with the indescribable excellency and magnitude of God's 
plan of salvation. Oh, how dull and blunted does now appear the 
common method of Christian instruction. Who can read these 
things and longer doubt and waver about the truth, beauty, and 
inspiration of the Bible, or the manner in which its glorious truths 
should be inculcated and demonstrated. I trust and believe that the 



great Author of the Word will prosper and bless you abundantly. 
Whatever else you have of like nature for grateful hearts, I trust you 
will favor your present correspondent with. At present I am very 
poor, but have better prospects before me, and when they arrive I 
will not forget "Zion's Watch Tower. " 

Yours truly, 

, M. D. 

P. S. —Please send me some "Food" for five friends, and let me 
know whether a preacher could come here. In truth and gratitude, 



_, KANSAS, Dec. , 10, 1881. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I have derived great comfort from 
the December number of "Watch Tower. " What a substantial meal 
of "strong meat. " I have read it nearly all twice over; some of it 
three and four times. I derived especial comfort from the article 
entitled, "The Blessed dying. "I have always dreaded dying, but if 
its conclusions are correct (and it at once impressed me so), I think 
I want to die-anything to be with Christ. The "Creative Week," by 
W. I. Mann, I thought was especially strong in its conclusions and 
deductions; shall read it again and study it. 

Now, dear brother, perhaps it would be as well to introduce myself. 
I am a preaching member of the Minnesota Conference of Christian 
Adventists. I have long been leaning toward the age-to-come views, 
much as one 

R312 : page 2 

would grope in the dark-seeing much truth in it; but with the light I 
had, could not make all points harmonize. It remained for your 
September number of "Watch Tower" to supply the missing link. I 
am thankful to God for it. I received it (humanly speaking) by the 
merest accident, but I believe it was sent of God. Now, dear 
brother, I would like a few copies of "Food for Thinking Christians. 
"I will treat and place each one as though it were pure gold. I want 
to send one to my brother, a minister, and to others. I am anxious to 
do all I can. Am very poor, but if God blesses will contribute to 
your Tract fund. Yours in hope. 



ONTARIO. 

DEAR BROTHER:-The books and paper I have received safely, 
for which accept my sincere thanks. I have received a great deal of 
profit from the reading of them. God's plan of salvation as seen by 
the aid of the "true light" (as I firmly believe), is sublime beyond 
anything of which I have had conception. My heart is overflowing 
with thankfulness to our Father and Saviour that I have been 
thought worthy to receive the "good news. "I feel as though my 
experiences were something like Paul's— as one born out of due 



time. My wife also believes, but does not seem to be able to forget 
the old teachings so readily as myself. Do you know of any other 
members of Christ in this neighborhood? 

Please put my name on your list of subscribers for the "Watch 
Tower. " Enclosed find one dollar to pay for above and postage on 
books, etc. 25 cents of the above was the price of a theatre ticket; I 
should have spent it for that before I received the light; now when I 
am tempted I shall send the money to you to use in the good cause. 
Will you kindly advise me in regard to severing my connection 
with the church of which I am a member. I feel as though I should 
not attend, because it would be consenting to their teaching, which I 
do not now believe. I have not really believed it for a long time, but 
I knew no better way. Now, thank God, it is different. I remain 
yours in the hope of eternal life. .

MEHERRIN DEPOT, VA. , 

Dec. 21st, 1881. 

DEAR BROTHER:-I am filled with thanks and praise to our 
heavenly Father for the precious truths received through your paper. 
I have spent much time in studying the subject of baptism; and just 
as I came out with my convictions on the subject, the "Watch 
Tower" came with an article ("Importance of Baptism") expressing 
my views better than I could. O, how gratifying to see what the real 
baptism is ! Now we can see that "he that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved. "But, my dear brother, I would like you to say a 
little more on one point, viz: If Jesus went into that eternal death of 
the human for us, why should we be baptized into and go through it 
for ourselves? 



[Answers to your question have been given in former numbers; but 
a very clear answer will be found in the reading of this month's 
supplement -"The Tabernacle" tract. We do not die for ourselves; 
but have fellowship with our Head in the atonement sacrifices for 
the world. We "fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of 
Christ. " Col. 1:24. -EDITOR. ]

EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND, To the Editor "Zion's Watch Tower. 

DEAR SIR:-I have perused your little book "Food for Thinking 
Christians," with very great interest, and also with profit. I am a 
missionary and divinity student in the last session of my course. I 
am very desirous of preaching on these glorious themes so well 



handled in your little volume; and will ever be much indebted to 
you, if you will supply me with some more copies, say 40. 1 shall 
certainly distribute them with judicious care, and sincerely trust 
they will be much blessed to those who read them. I will also be 
glad to receive some copies of the "Tabernacle and its Teachings. 

I remain, my dear sir, ever yours, most sincerely,

TRUTH SIFTING IN THE TOWER. 

We would like every interested reader to feel that he has an interest 
in the WATCH TOWER, and that it is our paper: a paper belonging 
to the Lord and hence to all his children. It is, and we hope will 
always be conducted, with an eye single to God's glory and hence 
to the blessing of his children. Like the Bible, it will not discuss 
questions, but will state what is believed to be truth and nothing 
else; accepting— The harmony of God's Word— as the definition of 
truth. No compromising with error to double the circulation; no 
withholding of truth lest some should be offended. No, the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth is our motto. 

But who shall judge what is truth, and how? This, to every 
conscientious editor, becomes an important question, but in our 
own case it is doubly so, because the subjects treated in our 
columns are, many of them, "new" (Matt. 13:52) and "strong meat. 
"We believe our readers are more effectually armed against error, 
by being instructed in the harmony of God's Word, than by having 
the columns of the W. T. devoted to the dissecting of all the various 
forms of error. Let the sunlight in, and the darkness will flee away. 
And with the plan of God clearly before the mind, the deformity of 
error is easily discoverable. The Bible, then, is our only standard, 
by which to test the truth or falsity of any subject. 

We will inform our readers what has been our method of sifting 
truth, that they may know of our carefulness in trying to separate 
truth from error. 

The editor seeks to test his own articles by the Word of God, but 
every article which appears in the paper, has the special criticism of 
some one or more of those who are walking in the light. If it be a 
new point of interpretation, it must have the assent of at least two of 
those best posted and most conversant with the Scriptures before it 
shall appear. If not seen by these intelligent and conscientious 
persons to be truth, it will lie over until such time as it shall be seen 
either to be truth and published, or error and destroyed. 

This rule which we apply to our own writings, we apply to others 
also, and as a consequence, very many articles are written for our 
paper which are never seen in it. This stringent rule is not liked by 
some, who consider it a reflection against their ability, thus proving 



that their human nature is not yet crucified,— the dead have no 
reputation to sustain or wound. But to those who are intent only on 
getting and spreading truth, this rule is generally very agreeable. 

We know of no other way to do, and the Lord has seemed to bless 
this method, for he has fed us richly; and though we stand ready to 
contradict the statements of any issue when shown to be erroneous, 
and would feel it both a duty and a privilege to do so, yet to the 
praise of our Lord's leading the course and teachings of the W. T. 
for the past three years have been connected, progressive and 
harmonious. And furthermore, those who are teachers of these 
things, never saw truth with so clear a vision as to-day, and never 
were so harmonious in sentiment. 

Be not offended then, if your article, should not appear. It is treated 
with the same loving consideration as all other articles. One dear 
brother to whom we returned an article with criticisms for re- 
consideration, in his reply, gave the following quotation: Offended- 
-how could I be? —"Great peace have they who love thy law and 
nothing shall offend them. " 

The course which we pursue relative to the dissemination of truth, 
we commend to our readers— use your time, your means, your 
influence, for truth, not error. Teach nothing, lend nothing, give 
nothing— neither book, paper nor tract, by whomsoever published, 
which you have not carefully examined and feel sure would glorify 
God.

BACK NUMBERS. 



We regret to say that the Nov. and Dec. 1881 issues of the 
TOWER, are all gone. However, the new readers should all have 
them; therefore we will republish them as soon as possible. All who 
want them should send a postal card. We published 6,000 of each of 
those numbers, and at the time, supposed that sufficient. 

R313 : page 2 

Of the present issue, there will be 10,000, which we expect will be 
sufficient for all requirements. We send the present number to 
many whose wrappers were marked to stop with last number. This 
is because, being overcrowded with fresh mails, we had not time to 
correct all of our list, and to some others, it is sent because of the 
Supplement, which we hope may be acceptable and profitable to 
them. 

We have plenty of tracts and September numbers, which you can 
have for free distribution by asking for them. Be discreet in their 
use, giving only to thinking Christians, so far as you can know, 
accompanying them with some words of your own. It is better to 



lend than to give them. Make a list of those to whom you lend, and 
never let them be idle. 



SUPPLEMENT. 

As a supplement, we send you "The Tabernacle and its Teachings," 
referred to in several previous numbers, and on the back of the 
pamphlet, FOOD FOR THINKING CHRISTIANS.

"Z. W. T. TRACT SOCIETY. " 

This Society was organized less than one year ago, for the object 
indicated by the name. It is but proper that a statement should now 
be made at the beginning of the year 1882. 

The object of the Society was stated but no requests for help were 
made. The donations below mentioned, were free-will offerings- 
some giving until they could feel it. The amounts ranged from one 
dollar up to thousands. 

Total am'ts of cash received, . . $35,391. 18 
expenditures in printing, etc. . . . 35,336. 18 

Balance in treasury, Jan $55. 00 

Bills coming due, about 400. 00 

To all whose donations have been over one hundred dollars, we 
have made special reports, and to any donor the books are always 
open for inspection. 

We propose continuing this fund, and will endeavor to use it 
prudently as fast as it is received. In fact as will be noticed in the 
above report, the expenditure generally exceeds the receipts, but a 
brother who has already contributed largely, guarantees any debts 
incurred, to the amount of one thousand dollars in excess of 
receipts. 

It is a principle with us, not to allow the Lord's money to rust. 

Should the fund increase sufficiently to permit it, we propose using 
some portion of it for sending out other laborers. 

We never solicit donations. Those who possess this world's goods 
and are wholly consecrated need only to know how they can use it. 
Donations to this fund should be specified. Address C. T. Russell, 
Pittsburgh. 



An article from Bro. A. D. Jones of the Day Star, relative to "The 
blessed dying"-in harmony with views presented in our last two 
issues —is crowded out of this number, but will appear in our next. 

Bro. J. requests us to correct an error which occurred in fourth 
column second page of the last (Dec.) number of the Day Star, viz: 
"To the division of the land," sixty instead of six years. 

We sent samples of the Day Star to about seven thousand names of 
our list, that they might have opportunity to judge of its merits.

ALEXANDER AND THE BANKRUPT 

It is related of the late Czar of Russia that in answer to the 
question, "Who is to pay all these?" he wrote -"I, Alexander. "It 
appears that one of his officers had contracted bills which it was 
impossible for him to pay, and, after contemplating them 
despairingly, had written the above query at the bottom of the 
paper, and fallen asleep. 

The Czar happened to pass through the room, and, observing the 
bill and its appended question, generously took the pen and wrote, 
"I Alexander," and quietly withdrew without disturbing the aid-de- 
camp. It is easier to imagine than describe the emotions of the 
debtor, who, on awakening, found all his pecuniary obligations 
cancelled. 

So the sinner looks at his condition and inquires, as the Russian, 
"Who is to pay all these?"We thank God we can answer that "Jesus 
paid it all. "He was wounded for our transgressions, and by His 
stripes we are healed. 

Jesus writes on our list of sins "I even I am he that blotteth out thy 
transgressions. "

PERILOUS TIMES. 



Perilous times in the world are at hand- 
Perils by water and perils by land; 
Perils in churches and perils in state, 
Perils attending the good and the great. 

Watchman, how readest thou touching this hour? 
Fearful corruption in places of power; 



Presidents, princes and kings in dismay- 
Tragic unfoldings the news of the day. 

Scriptures prophetic discoursing on time, 
Teach us the doctrine of increase of crime; 
"Evil seducers shall wax worse and worse," 
Ere the Jehovah shall "smite with a curse. " 

Is the church powerless to draw from the skies 
Help when Goliath their army defies? 
Is there no king in the camp of "to-day"? 
Is the true Israel "fallen away"? 

Is it the sign of the presence of Christ, 
Of the Messiah in person to reign? 
Has sin attained to its manhood of power? 
Is this its zenith? Is morning the hour? 

The son of perdition, the god of this world, 
Down from his kingdom of sin must be hurled; 
Tares must be gathered and burned in the fire- 
Type of all Christians in name— not in power. 

Jesus is come ! O let it be known, 
Jehovah's anointed, now takes the throne; 
He takes the helm and the power to command, 
He'll guide affairs on the sea and the land. 

Jesus is come ! let all the world hear, 
"Who's on the Lord's side" let him draw near. 
"Come with your armor, your loins girt about"; 
Come with your trumpets, and join in the shout. 

Jerichoes tremble and Sodoms consume, 
Kingdoms are tottering before the "Commune"; 
Davids, go forth with your sling-stones of faith, 
Take ye the heads of "the giants of Gath. "

JESUS MADE PERFECT. 

"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things 
which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of 
eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. " (Heb. 5:9.) 

Knowledge of both evil and good is essential to a hearty acceptance 
of the good and invariable rejection of evil. Therefore, we believe 
that Jehovah has given, and is giving such knowledge to every 
intelligent creature, both in heaven and on earth. 

We see how all of the human family are getting their knowledge by 
contact and actual experience with sin and its penalty-misery and 



death. And we believe, as we have previously expressed, that the 
heavenly creatures— angels and arch-angels, are learning the same 
lessons by watching man's experiences. Thus mankind in general, 
and the church in particular, is made a "spectacle to angels. " (1 
Cor. 4:9.) 

If we look backward, we see him who as a man was called Jesus, in 
his pre-human existence, "The beginning of the creation of God"- 
The agent and "righteous servant" of Jehovah, in the creation of all 
that has since been created. 

Perfect as a being, as are all of Jehovah's creatures, yet he knew 
only good— had never experienced evil, nor witnessed its effects. 
Later, after angels and arch-angels had been created he witnessed 
the apostasy and rebellion on the part of Satan and his host, then the 
setting up of the rival spiritual kingdom defying the 

R314 : page 3 

power of Jehovah to overthrow it, and offering freedom from all 
restraints and from all obedience to God, to those who would join 
them. 

Though the law of God was "The wages of sin is death and the soul 
(being) that sinneth, it shall die— yet the execution of that sentence 
tarried and no evidence of his power to enforce it, was given, and 
even yet, though he declares that Satan shall, be destroyed, we see 
it not accomplished. How for ages he has seemed to triumph over 
Jehovah, his influence even reaching the intelligent creatures of 
earth, beguiling and alluring them into sin and consigning them to 
death. What a test of faith in, and love for Jehovah, was this 
spectacle! For hundreds and thousands of years they must walk by 
faith in the power of Jehovah to accomplish the destruction of evil 
doers, and reward the patient fidelity of the loyal and obedient. 

Let us now in thought stand side by side with Jesus when tempted 
by Satan and imagine the trial of faith, he endured, for we believe 
that he, as we, walked by faith and not by sight. He had witnessed 
Jehovah's works of creation and preservation; he had marked the 
wise and loving benevolence that adapted competent means to 
glorious ends, and such was the strength of love and unbounded 
confidence awakened by this general knowledge of Jehovah's 
character, that he did not for a moment hesitate to submit all he had, 
even life itself, to his will, for the accomplishment of his purposes. 
The language of his obedient faith was "Though he slay me yet will 
I trust in him. " 

So he submitted to the Father's will to accomplish the work of 
redeeming mankind by exchanging his glorious body and heavenly 
honors for the form and the nature of man, that by so doing he 
might be obedient unto death-even the death of the cross, and thus 
become a ransom for man. All this he did by faith, for he had never 
yet seen any being restored from the death condition into which he 
volunteered to go, trusting alone in God's ability as promised, to 



restore him to a higher form of life, and through him to restore 
humanity to its perfection. 

But when he had become a man, Satan again appeared to tempt him 
sorely, and we might thus paraphrase the temptation: Ah, says he, 
how unwise you have been; once you were greater than me, now I 
am your superior —a powerful spiritual being, while you have 
become a man— "lower than the angels. "How absurd to let Jehovah 
thus degrade you. True, he has made great promises and greatly 
boasts of his power to execute them, but he cannot. I have the 
power of death (Heb. 2:14.) and the human race are all subject to 
my "power" and never has Jehovah been able to liberate even one 
from death, nor destroy me as he threatened. Now, let me, as your 
friend, counsel you wisely: Since you have so unwisely forfeited 
your higher form of life, so that you may never regain it, don't give 
up, but keep the life you now have. If you die you never shall live 
again, neither will you be able to liberate mankind from death. 

Why should you waste it in a fruitless effort for this race? 

If you are the Son of God command that these stones be made 
bread (Matt. 4:3)-use your power for self-gratification and 
preservation, and don't present your body a living sacrifice, dying 
daily, when you have a perfect right to life. Jesus answers "Man 
shall not live by bread alone," I could not enjoy life, even with all 
my wants supplied, out of communion with my Father. 

Your trust in Jehovah is misplaced; first prove Him and see if he 
will keep his word. Cast yourself down from this pinnacle of the 
temple-it is written, "He shall give his angels charge concerning 
thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou 
dash thy foot against a stone. " 

Jesus replied: "It is written, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. " 
We may not thus test the Almighty by needless exposure. 

Then Satan showed Jesus the kingdoms and honors of earth, saying: 
I am the "Prince of this world. " (John 14:30. )A11 the kingdoms of 
earth are under my control; you long for power yourself to do good 
to mankind; now, I propose that you shall be my representative in 
the world and rule all these kingdoms. I will put all under your 
control, if you will yield allegiance to me. You will be great indeed, 
for you are a perfect man, while all others are imperfect, and you 
can live forever. Since your life is not forfeited, no one can take it 
from you. You can thus be Lord of lords and King of kings; to bless 
mankind throughout all generations. All this power you can have 
without suffering and you can enter upon the work of blessing at 
once. And by your wise and prudent ruling, you can greatly elevate 
and benefit them while they live, whereas, if you die, you simply 
waste your life and benefit no one. 

But Jesus again replies— No matter what inducements you may 
offer, I will yield allegiance to none but Jehovah-It is written, 
"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou 



serve. "Thus, his faith in Jehovah's power and promise was tested 
beyond our power to comprehend; but faith founded on the 
knowledge of Jehovah's character triumphed —"By his knowledge, 
shall my righteous servant justify many. " By lack of that 
knowledge of God, Adam fell into transgression while through his 
knowledge, Jesus remained the righteous servant— therefore, able to 
justify many. 

By faith, he consecrated; by faith, he resisted all temptation; by 
faith, he endured the self-sacrifice even unto death, as a reward for 
which he was made perfect as a divine being -the first-born into 
the divine family. 

Thus in Jesus' case faith ended in fruition of that which Jehovah 
had promised, and being thus perfected- "exalted," as a divine 
being- "he is the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey 
him. " 

Hence the author and finisher of our faith is he who was made 
divinely perfect, through the sufferings of the sinless human nature 
even unto death. (Heb. 12:2.) 

This agrees with Phil. 2:8-1 1, where Paul declares that Jesus "being 
found in fashion as a man, (30 years old) humbled (sacrificed 
himself during 3-1/2 years) and became obedient unto death, even 
the death of the cross. Wherefore, God also HATH HIGHLY 
EXALTED HIM [to Glory-IMMORTALITY -DIVINITY-], and 
given him a name above every name. . . that every tongue should 
confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God, the Father. 

As with the leader and forerunner so with the disciples: We are 
being made perfect through sufferings yet not the flesh (or human 
nature) is being perfected but our new nature. The outward man 
perishes but the inward man is renewed day by day until in our 
resurrection or change we shall be "raised spiritual" like unto 
Christ's glorious body-made perfect. 



R314 : page 3 

THE JEWISH SABBATH. 

Because seven was so intimately connected with all God's works 
and plans, and because he intended all his works to culminate in 
perfection, therefore, when he selected Israel as a typical people, he 
gave them several Sabbaths or rests which shadowed certain 
blessings of rest in future, and as was His method, he used seven to 
represent that coming perfection of rest. 

Hence, we find in their Law, a number of Sabbaths. The seventh 
day and its cycle of seven times seven days or forty-nine days, 
reached and pointed to the fiftieth or Jubilee day, the day of 
Pentecost. So they had year Sabbaths; every seventh year was a 
Sabbath year to the land, during which it rested. The cycle of the 



year Sabbaths was seven times seven or forty-nine years, reaching 
and pointing to the fiftieth or Jubilee year. Thus we see the 
Sabbaths and their cycles to have been- 

The 7th day; 7 x 7 = 49 bringing the 50th or Jubilee day-Pentecost. 

The 7th year; 7 x 7 = 49 bringing the 50th or Jubilee year. 

Now, these things they did, in a shadowy or typical sense and did 
not discern the meaning of the types. But as the Apostles declare, 
these things were done and written before for our (the gospel 
church's) edification; that we might understand and locate the real 
Sabbaths by examining the types. Types are not to last forever, but 
must cease when the antitype has come. 

Now, our claim is, that all these typical Law Sabbaths ceased, at or 
before the death of Jesus, who made an end of the Law which 
commanded the types. None of these types were commanded before 
the giving of the Law to Israel at Sinai (Deut. 5:3-23) and they were 
all done away when Jesus "made an end of the Law, nailing it to his 
cross. " (Col. 2:14) 

The year Sabbaths as types ceased first; they ceased at the 
Babylonian captivity, and there the great cycle of fifty times fifty 
years commenced, which reached to the anti-typical or real Jubilee 
time, the Millennial age- "Times of restitution of all things. "This 
cycle carried us 1 874 years into the Christian era, and showed us 
when the work of restitution was due to begin-beginning by 
breaking in pieces and removing the rubbish of error and bad 
government, preparing for the blessings of all the families of the 
earth. 

The typical day Sabbaths, did not pass away for long years 
afterward; 

R315 : page 3 

it was part of the Law when Jesus was in the flesh, and every 
feature of the Law was duly kept by him. It then must have been a 
one part of the Law, which ended at the Cross. Now, if the type 
ended there, the anti-type must have come, and if we can find an 
anti-type in place of the type, we shall have conclusive proof of the 
end of the type to support Paul's statement, that "Christ made an 
end of the Law. " 

Let us look for the anti-type: Israel was commanded to count from 
the morrow after the (Passover) Sabbath. There we begin to count 
the cycle of seven times seven days which would bring us to the 
real Sabbath (rest) typified by their day Sabbaths. You know how 
Jesus rose from death on the morning after the Passover Sabbath, 
and counting fifty days it brings us to Pentecost day. Jesus was with 
the disciples forty of these days, and then as he had commanded, 
they waited for the blessing of Pentecost, viz: the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit-that sealing of the Spirit, or witness of the acceptance 
by the Father, gave the rest (Sabbath) of faith. 



There then, the disciples entered 

R315:page4 

into a rest of faith, of which the seventh day was but an imperfect 
type— a rest not of one day in the week, but of all days. As Jews 
they had scrupulously observed the seventh day as a rest day; no 
work, of any sort must be done in it. Yet they were in a condition of 
unrest, for though they kept this one feature of the Law, many 
others they could not keep and Jesus had said that the failure in 
keeping one point constituted the person a breaker of the Law, and 
consequently none of them ever kept the Law, but Jesus only. So 
they were in a condition of unrest actually and hence Jesus 
addressed himself to all such, saying "Come unto me all ye that are 
weary and heavy laden (trying to do a thing impossible to you, as 
members of a fallen race, viz: to keep the perfect Law of God)— I 
will give you rest. "(Sabbath means rest. (Matt. 1 l:28.)While with 
them, Jesus did not give them the rest, but, he like them, observed 
the type as was necessary until it was "finished" on the cross. And 
after his resurrection he did not give them the promised rest, but 
told them to tarry until they should receive the Comforter-the 
evidence of their acceptance as Sons of Jehovah. When thus sealed 
by the Spirit, it was the evidence of the truth of all Jesus promised, 
the witness of their adoption to the divine family. 

This same rest or Sabbath is the privilege of every true child of God 
ever since, "We that believe do enter into rest. " (Heb. 4:3.) 

But no one can enter into a full rest of faith, who does not realize 
Christ as the end of the Law to every one who believeth. (Rom. 
10:4.) To all such, love is the fulfilling of the law. Love to God will 
produce a spirit of obedience, so that we will do so as far as able, 
those things which are well pleasing in his sight; even so far as the 
crucifixion of the flesh with its affections and desires. Thus, "Love 
is the fulfilling of the Law. " (Rom. 13:10. )Thus "The righteousness 
(or spirit) of the Law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh 
but after the spirit. " 

We may rest if we require it, on the seventh or first or any other day 
and be blameless; but if we observe any of these days in an attempt 
to keep the law given to Israel (Gal. 5 :4) but never given to the 
Gentiles nor to Christians, and fulfilled and ended in the person of 
Jesus, even so far as it applied to Israel— has failed to fully 
appreciate the value of Christ's finished work, and failed to 
appreciate his standing as a son, not under the written law which 
was given to the house of servants. 

Such as are seeking to commend themselves to God by works of the 
Law, are not resting but working, for as Paul says- "He that is 
entered into rest has ceased from his own works as God did (rest) 
from his. " (Heb. 4:10.)God rested from his works and committed it 
all to the Son, and we, if we would rest, must cease from our 
works— cease from the law and accept of its legal fulfilment as 
being accomplished once for all in our representative, Jesus. 



When we realize that even were we Israelites, we are no longer 
condemned, but justified by that Law, Jesus having ransomed all 
who were under it; and, that as new creatures in Christ, we are 
under only the "Law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus," viz: Love. 
Now we rest well pleased to have it so; and to enjoy this real 
antitypical rest (Sabbath) which Christ gives to the house of sons, 
rather than the type of it given to the house of servants. Thus, by 
letting Christ do it, we rest from our own works as God did from 
his. [As shown in last issue, God rests since his creation of man and 
"has committed all judgment (ruling and administration of earth) 
unto the son. " "The Father worketh hitherto, and (now) I work," 
said Jesus. ] 

There remaineth a rest [Sabbath] for the people of God-when we 
enter fully into all the blessings promised; but let us not only look 
forward to it, with joy, but endeavor to use and enjoy the earnest of 
our inheritance; the sample of our coming rest which is now our 
privilege. "Come unto me and I will give you rest. ""They that 
believe do enter into rest. " 

SUNDAY. 

We are glad that by common consent some one day in the week is 
generally observed as a day for rest from worldly toil. The day 
generally observed— the first day of the week— we regard as 
especially fitting and appropriate, because on the first day of the 
week, Jesus, our Lord, arose from death— and on the first day came 
the Holy Spirit upon the church in the upper room (Pentecost). 
Concerning the name of this day, whether it be called "Sunday," 
"The first-day," "The Sabbath day," or "The Lord's day," we care 
little. At most they are only names, though our preference would 
rather incline to the latter. Our objection to calling it a Sabbath or 
rest day being, first, that to the fleshly Israel, God called the 
seventh day the Sabbath, and there is a liability to confusion of 
thoughts, and a mistaking of the servants' law for the liberty or 
privilege of the Sons of God. Secondly, with most of christians, the 
first day of the week is the one on which they work the most and 
hardest, and consequently it could not appropriately be termed a 
rest or Sabbath. 

We much regret, that even among thinking christians, the "Lord's 
day" and its privileges are so little understood and appreciated. To 
most of them, its observance is but the keeping of the fourth 
command of the Law though they well know that the Law reads 
"The seventh day is the Sabbath," and that the day they observe is 
the first. For the ignorance and superstition and legal dread of the 
Lord's day, the clergy is largely to blame. Many of them doubtless 
fear that if recognized as a privilege, and not as a law, it would be 
violated. But the fear of man always gets us into a snare of the 
devil, and so this fear has borne much poisonous fruit in the church, 
for it has helped to put christians under the Law of Moses, instead 
of under that of Christ- "Love," and thus has deprived many of 



entering into rest. It would be far better that christians should be 
resting fully in Christ and free from the Law-standing fast in the 
liberty wherewith Christ has made them free (Gal. 5:1.) both on this 
and other subjects, though the preaching of the truth on the subject 
had left the world at liberty to disregard the "Lord's day. "This age 
we must remember is especially designed for the preparation of the 
body or Bride of Christ, that when they are united or made one with 
him, now in the end of this age, the world may believe during the 
incoming age.

SON OF GOD. 



There seem to be different senses in which God is a Father; or he is 
a Father of his creatures, on different planes. But there is no 
mother, on either plane. As the Creator of Angels and men, he is 
their Father, and they his sons, though on different planes. 

That the Angels (Spiritual beings) are called sons of God, seems 
evident from several statements; for instance —Job 1:6 and 2:1; 
There was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves 
before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. 

Also Job 38:7. When the morning stars sang together, and all the 
Sons of God shouted for joy. Man is also a Son of God by creation. 
Luke 3:38 says, Adam was a Son of God. 

Then there is a higher sense in which some are to become sons, not 
only on the spiritual plane, but immortal sons. Those, who present 
their bodies a living sacrifice, and thus suffer with Christ, are made 
partakers of the divine nature, and will be made in the express 
image of God's person-Heb. 1 :3. The body of their humiliation 
changed, and fashioned like Christ's glorious body. Phil. 3:21. Has 
not the Son of God, been a Son, successively, in all of the three 
senses? 

It would seem that he appeared to Abraham, vailed as a man, when 
the three men came to him in the heat of the day; Gen. 18:1,13,22; 
that he was with three Hebrews in the fiery furnace-Dan. 3:25; and 
Daniel saw him as a spiritual being, and fell as a dead man. Dan. 
10. Unquestionably he was the beginning of the Creation, of God in 
his pre-existent state, whatever application may be made of Rev. 
3:14. 

R316:page4 

In due time he was born of a woman, and became a man; and was a 
son of God, as the first Adam— man—, was a son, as seems clear 
from Luke 1:35. 

On that plane he was the second son; and gave himself a ransom for 
the first. The first man's disobedience and death involved the whole 
human family in a state of death; the second man's obedience unto 



death, secured for the same family justification to life— the same life 
that was lost. God sending his own son— son before he came— in the 
likeness of sinful flesh etc. Rom. 8:3. 

The blood of Jesus Christ, his son —son after he came— cleanseth us 
from all sin. 1 Jno. 1 :7. 

Let us examine Phil. 2:5, on, in the light of the new Revision, text, 
and marginal reading by the American Committee. 

Have this mind in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who existing 
in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God, 
a thing to be grasped; but emptied himself, taking the form of a 
bond servant, becoming in the likeness of men, etc. 

Here is certainly a clear statement of his pre-existence in God's 
form,— a spiritual being; yet not equal with him; and of a change of 
condition from a spiritual to a human being. He certainly was not 
immortal in either of these phases of his existence. If he had been, 
as a spiritual being, he could not have become a man; and as a man, 
he could not have died; but being found in fashion as a man, he 
humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, yea, the death of 
the cross. 

Wherefore— because of this— God highly exalted him, and gave him 
a name-position and condition— which is above every name. He 
could not "grasp" it himself, but God exalted him; raised him from 
the dead, and now he is the express image of his Father's person, or, 
being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his 
substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when 
he had made purifications of sins— by his death,-sat down on the 
right hand of the majesty on high; having become, by so much, 
better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name 
than they. Heb. 1:3,4. 

Does not Paul have in mind these three phases or planes of sonship 
in Rom. l:3,4?Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an 
apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which he promised afore 
by his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who 
was born of the seed of David according to the flesh; who was 
declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from 
the dead. 

Though we may not be able to explain all the mystery, yet it seems 
that on the last two planes, there was a begetting and birth. Now the 
birth of Jesus— the man— was on this wise; Mary. . . was found with 
child of the Holy Spirit-power of God—. . . that which is conceived 
in her is of the Holy Spirit; and she shall bring forth a son; and thou 
shalt call his name Jesus. Matt. 1:18-21. 

Again in Luke 1 :35. And the Angel answered and said unto her; 
The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most 
High shall overshadow thee; wherefore, also that which is to be 
born shall be called holy, the Son of God. Out of Egypt I did call 
my Son. Luke 2:15. He grew in favor with God and man, and at the 



age of thirty, he made a covenant of death and expressed it by 
baptism; when the Holy Spirit came upon him. Through that Spirit 
he offered himself-his human nature and body- without spot to 
God-Heb. 9:14. — ; and it became the germ of a new nature so 
when he was put to death in the flesh, he was made alive by the 
Spirit— 1 Pet. 3:18; and became a quickening-life giving Spirit. 1 
Cor. 15:45. The perfect natural man was crowned with glory and 
honor, Heb. 2:7, and lost it; but Jesus came to restore him. So he 
was crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God, he 
should taste of death for every man -Heb. 2:9; which shows that he 
did not take our fallen nature. And the word became flesh, and 
dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only 
begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. For God so loved the 
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth 
in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God sent not his 
Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world should be 
saved through him. 

Was it the only begotten on the spiritual plane who died?We would 
say on the earthly. 

The man Christ gave himself a ransom for all. 1 Tim. 2:5,6. 
Because he gave his human nature, his heavenly Father gave him 
the divine nature —because he gave his earthly body, God gave him 
a spiritual body. God gives to every seed its own body, as it hath 
pleased him. 1 Cor. 15:38. 

He does with all who present their bodies a living sacrifice, as he 
did with Jesus. Having suffered with him, even unto death, they 
will be glorified with him, to become his body; the fullness or full 
development of him who is filling all things with all-Eph. 1 :23. In 
brief, this completed Christ, having died and lived again, becomes 
Lord-Rom. 14:9; 

R316 : page 5 

or Agelasting Father of the human family restored, by the "better 
sacrifice, "-Heb. 9:23, to the original condition of sons. These 
restored sons, instead of being required to sacrifice the human, to 
become partakers of the divine nature; are given each a hundred 
years to fully develop the human. Isa. 65.

ASSEMBLING TOGETHER. 

"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. . . and so 
much the more as ye see the day approaching. " (Heb. 10:25.) 

The necessity for the assembling together for mutual edification, 
encouragement and strengthening, has been very generally 
acknowledged among Christians, yet we doubt if this most 



desirable end is very frequently attained— and why? Because we 
think, in most cases, God is not permitted to speak, among them, or 
if so, he is limited. 

These assemblings together, oftenest take the form of prayer and 
experience meetings, unless there is one of the number who is able 
to preach, and then the tendency is to depend upon that one, to a 
greater extent than is profitable. 

The writer attended one of these experience meetings among those 
professing the higher life, where God was almost shut out, and poor 
weak humanity, ignorant of its weakness as it always is, had 
abundant opportunity to boast itself. At the beginning of the 
meeting, one text of scripture was read, the context of which, all 
were ignorant of, and consequently its true application could not be 
understood. The dear old book was closed and reverently laid aside 
and a prayer was offered, after which, one after another told how he 
or she felt and acted. One lady told how she, before rising in the 
morning, received her morsel of food (a single text of scripture) on 
which she fed all day. How many do so— taking a text that happens 
to be stored in memory, often interpreting it out of all harmony with 
the context because they fail to examine it closely, taking a little 
crumb of comfort, when the Lord has spread his bountiful table and 
invited them to feast at it. 

Nearly two hours passed and the human spirit had magnified itself 
greatly, while the holy spirit (God-like mind) of the "new 
creatures," (for such I believe they were) was almost quenched. A 
brother seemed to perceive that something was wrong, and said 
"What these meetings want is more prayer," and then proceeded to 
pray for every thing he could think of, ignorant of the fact that he 
asked for many things in direct opposition to God's expressed will. 
And so the meeting closed without attaining the object for which 
they met, because God was shut out. 

Again, at another of these meetings, one hungry sister ventured to 
ask information with reference to a certain scripture, and was told 
that lest it should provoke controversy, and since they wished to 
have harmony, they would just pass over that, and so she was left 
unfed. 

Now is this right-shall we sell the truth to purchase harmony-and 
are we so puffed up as to be offended if God's word should 
overthrow our former convictions? Or shall we limit God to five or 
ten minutes and take the remainder of two hours to listen to each 
others experiences, which in nine cases out of ten, would be better 
untold? Why not open the doors wide and let the blessed Master 
come in and lead our meetings? 

It matters not whether there is any one learned or talented among 
you. Let each one bring his own Bible, paper, and pencil, and avail 
yourselves of as many helps in the way of a Concordance, Em. 
Diaglott, old and new versions of the New Testament, etc. , as 
possible. Choose your subject; ask for the Spirit's guidance in the 



understanding of it; then read, think, compare scripture with 
scripture, and you will assuredly be guided into truth. "And the 
truth shall make you free"-free from error, superstition, and the 
corruption of our perverse nature, and the Holy Spirit (mind of God 
and Christ) if entertained will liberate you from formality, as well 
as from self-exaltation. 

Our prayers need not be long— or vain repetitions of the same thing, 
since we are not heard for our much speaking. In few and simple 
words, 

R317:page5 

we can make known our wants as far as we can estimate them; but 
God has so much more to tell us than we have to tell him. Let him 
speak, much and long and often-through his WORD. "Sanctify 
them through thy truth, thy word is truth," was Jesus' prayer, and 
his admonition, "Search the Scriptures for these are they that testify 
of me. "(John 17:17 and 5:39. )So will we learn to delight ourselves 
in God's Law; it will be our meditation by night and by day. (Psa. 
1 19:97. )So also will he work in us to will and to do of his good 
pleasure. (Phil. 2:13.)

CONSECRATION TO A WORK. 

Among Christians there is much which passes for "entire 
consecration," but it is often a consecration to some self-imposed 
task, or work, instead of to God. 

Some are consecrated and are living sacrifices to business, some to 
their families, some to the temperance work, some to building up a 
denominational church or Sunday School, some to ministering to 
the poor and the sick. These are each good enough in their way, but 
none of these are the proper consecration for a follower of Jesus. 

Our consecration, like that of Jesus, should be to do the will of our 
Father in Heaven. Jesus says he came not to do his own will, but the 
will of Him that sent him. (John 6:38)The fact that you have any 
choice or preference as to what you shall do, is an evidence in 
itself, that your will is not dead. 

Consecration to a work of our own choosing merely, will never 
bring us to the great reward. "I beseech you brethren, that ye 
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable UNTO 
GOD. "Then, if He sends you into the "temperance work," or into 
any other work, it will be acceptable as unto the Lord. 

If will less, and seeking only to do his will it will bring us to His 
Word much and often, to learn that will, and "He that seeketh 
findeth. "We leave the subject here, merely suggesting that thus 



seeking after, thus consecrating, some who are now— laboring 
chiefly for "the meat that perisheth" or Temperance and moral 
reforms in the world, or for the extension of sectarian church 
influence, would find directions something like the following: 

This is the will of God even YOUR sanctification. (1 Thes. 4:3.) Do 
"good unto all men [in any way] as you have opportunity especially 
to the household of faith. " (Gal. 6:10.) "Forsake not the assembling 
of yourselves together" (Heb. 10:25.) but meet for the purpose of 
"BUILDING UP YOURSELVES on your most holy faith. " (Jude 
20.)

INQUIRIES ANSWERED. 

The following letter received recently was handed to Sister Russell 
for answering, and as the points might interest others, we publish. 

DEAR SIR:- 

Sent you a card which you will receive before you see this. Wished 
to ask several questions. I am interested in your paper, am a 
thinking Christian, but not settled in my views, seeking MORE 
LIGHT. Are we to expect revivals and the conversion of sinners 
now? Are we to labor for this result? Is the church coming up 
higher? Are we to come out of the church, take our name off church 
books, or remain in the church and labor to bring the rest upon the 
higher plain; or is each individual to be fully persuaded in his own 
mind and act according to his conscience? Shall I tell my sisters of 
like faith, better come out from among them nominally? In spirit, I 
am far from the majority— this I have called "coming out from 
among them. I want to be right. Will you take the trouble to answer 
"the thinking Christian's questions? Please be plain. Many are 
inquiring. What shall I tell them? I may read your letter (should you 
write one) to others. 

My husband is a Methodist minister. Not preaching this year 
however. 

Tell me plain truth, fear not. 

DEAR SISTER:-Your letter is at hand, many such show us that 
there are very many hungry, thinking christians. Our love and 
sympathy reach out to all such though we have never met face to 
face, and we call them brother and sister because we see in them the 
family likeness-the spirit of Christ. 

You ask if we may expect revivals of religion in the nominal 
church. No, we do not look for any evidence whatever of God's 
favor to this last phase of the nominal Gospel church which is 
spewed out of his mouth, because in her own estimation, she is rich 
and increased in goods (both spiritual and temporal) and has need 
of nothing. See how perfectly the picture of the church of to-day is 



drawn in Rev. 3:14,18. That mixed condition of worldliness and 
lukewarm Christianity we believe to be the Babylon (confusion) of 
Rev. 18:2, out of which (vs. 4) the Lord calls the few of his own 
who still remain in that city doomed to destruction. There will 
probably be some accessions to their membership, but mainly from 
the Sunday Schools-the church is straining every effort to keep up 
appearances and urging immature childhood to join its ranks and 
swell its numbers. But this is not making christians as we 
understand the word. Christians are those who have consecrated 
themselves to the Lord— agree to follow Jesus' footsteps in the 
crucifying of the flesh (the human privileges and honors, etc.) 

All others than the true wheat brought in, help to swell the numbers 
of the tares. Tares are not wicked people necessarily (though some 
are wicked) but people who are out of place in the church- 
imitating Christians in some respects as tares imitate wheat. Those 
who get such into the church nominal, do an injury both to the 
person and to the church. The church is injured by getting a lifeless 
member to absorb its vitality, and who as a representative will serve 
to lower the standard of Christianity. 

The individual is injured by being told that he is a Christian when 
he is not, and thus is worse off than if aware of his own position. 

Surely, then, many people who engage in this improper work, some 
of whom, if not all, think they are doing God service, must be 
mistaken. And this work has been going on for years so that much 
of the wheat has been almost choked with tares. It is not God's 
work but Satan's. The tares do an injury to the church, and Satan 
was instrumental (using God's children as his instruments) in 
getting them into the church to work the havoc they have. "He that 
sowed the tares is the devil," (Matt. 13,) no matter who was willing 
or unwittingly the instrument, (vs. 21). 

With this, I will mail a June No. of ZION'S WATCH TOWER, the 
first article of which ("He on the housetop") will more thoroughly 
answer your question with reference to coming out of Babylon. It is 
of no use, to remain there trying to prop an organization which God 
has doomed to destruction: Better far, to trust his judgment with 
reference to expediency and promptly obey his command as soon as 
he makes it clear. The Lord loves prompt obedience, and then it is a 
great advantage, as it gives no opportunity to confer with flesh and 
blood. 

Since we are in the "harvest" of the age, the work to be done is 
harvest work: The great work of the present is to help to ripen and 
gather into the barn-condition of safety, the true wheat. We would 
"do good to all men especially to the household of faith"-But if we 
find enough of this special work to keep our time fully occupied, 
we have no occasion whatever to worry about the rest of the world; 
for in God's "due time," they shall all be brought to a knowledge of 
the truth "and a full, fair opportunity to gain eternal life, and though 
they may first die (in Adam) the ransom price entitles them to a 



restoration from the Adamic death, and an opportunity to escape the 
second death by obedience to the law of God written in their hearts, 
no more stony but fleshly. (Jer. 31:33.) Then, instead of being 
prone to do evil as the sparks to fly upward, it will be the reverse- 
easy and natural to obey when the knowledge of the Lord shall fill 
the whole earth, and when the Lord rules instead of Satan. 

Knowing God's glorious purposes for the world, Jesus let the 
Gentiles alone and devoted his time entirely to the harvesting of the 
Jewish church. Though Gentiles as well as Jews were constantly 
going down in death, he did not try to save them then, knowing it 
was not yet God's due time. 

I am glad to know that in spirit you are separate from the nominal 
church; I think all of God's true children are. They see the effects, 
but they do not understand the cause of the loss of God's favor to 
her. "Woe to those who are at ease in Zion;" but the Lord will 
"comfort all that mourn in Zion. "When? Isaiah says her condition 
shall be a vexation to such, only till he makes 

R318:page5 

them to understand the doctrine-or the plan of God. And his plan is 
now being made clear to those who can rest their faith on a "thus 
saith the Lord," ignoring entirely the traditions of men. 

R318:page6 

In coming out there are many sacrifices to be made, and you 
especially will find it so. A minister in our city said:Bro. R. , I 
believe these things are true, but it would not be prudent to preach 
them. Husband replied, I would fear to be too prudent in this matter 
since the Lord "hides things from the wise and prudent. "That 
minister had a large family well supported by a fashionable, 
worldly congregation who did not want to be disturbed in their 
sleep. He ventured to preach a little of what he believed and they 
told him it would not do; and to-day he is hiding his light under a 
bushel, or rather, it has gone out and he is walking on, hand in hand 
with the world, flourishing in worldly affairs; yet who can estimate 
that poverty in spiritual things? 

You may be called upon to sacrifice your present means of living, 
but fear not, the Lord will provide another. No man hath forsaken 
all to follow Jesus, who did not receive a hundred-fold in return. It 
was refreshing to read that sentence in your letter- "Tell me plain 
truth, fear not. " I could tell you much more than I have time to 
write at present. The Lord has so wonderfully led me from darkness 
to light, and from husks to corn, that my heart is filled with his 
praise. 

The great sacrifice necessary, has kept the majority of ministers 
from the truth, but thank God, there is some ripe wheat among 
them, not choked by the tares. May God's grace be sufficient for 
you and your dear husband. 



Your Sister in hope, 

MRS. C. T. RUSSELL.

THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE. 

DIALOGUE-REV. 13. 

READER:-To properly appreciate the following, you should read 
and have clearly in mind, the articles in our last issue, (Dec. 1881,) 
headed: "The Antichrist" and "The Counterfeit of the Kingdom of 
God. " 

B. I am here again Bro. A. , anxious to pursue the investigation of 
Revelation 13, as you suggested at our last meeting. I have long felt 
a deep interest in this chapter, and especially because other 
scriptures refer to the beast and image here described, and say that 
the overcomers get a victory over the Beast and Image and the 
number of his name. My difficulty has been that not understanding 
the significance of these symbols, I could not know whether I had 
gotten a victory over them or not. I shall give earnest heed and 
endeavor to weigh your arguments by the Word of God only, and 
not by the "traditions of the Fathers. " 

A. That is the only proper way to study Scripture. We should come 
to it believing that "It (and it alone) is able to make us wise," (2 
Tim. 3:15,) and it is this class who shall understand. Daniel said-In 
the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall 
be increased, and the wise shall understand. To rightly understand 
how it is that certain parts of truth could be hid from all past ages, 
and yet be due to be understood by us now, we should remember, 
that God's Word is a great treasure house in which he has hid in 
past time, all knowledge needful to his children in all ages. It is a 
great storehouse from which his servants may bring forth things 
both new and old— meat in due season for the household of faith. 
(Matt. 24:45.) It is because this truth is generally overlooked or 
disregarded, that so many of the Lord's saints go to old musty 
volumes of the traditions of the Fathers, instead of going to the 
fountain of living truths-The Bible. 

B. When we look at it, this is very dishonoring to the words of 
Jesus which he puts on a par with himself saying, "Whosoever shall 
be ashamed of me and of my words. . . of him also shall the son of 
man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father. " 
(Mark 8:38. )It dishonors the Father also, for Jesus said that his 
spirit would guide us into all truth and show us things to come. 
(John 16:13.) 



A. Let us then commence: I will use the "Emphatic Diaglott" 
translation as it is so much more clear; then you can have the 
benefit of both versions. 

Let me first lay down a simple rule for interpreting some symbols 
found in this chapter. Dragon-civil power, Pagan Rome; Heavens- 
the higher or ruling powers; Earth- the people under, or obedient to 
the ruling powers (heavens); Sea— the general masses of mankind, 
not under religious restraint. 

The first two verses of this chapter, direct our attention to the 
Dragon which in the preceding chapter we found to symbolize the 
Roman Empire; the same which Daniel saw in vision called the 
"fourth beast dreadful and terrible" (Dan. 7:7.)This dragon passed 
its dominion over to a beast which arose out of the sea— a 
government which came up from among the irreligious masses; in 
other words the Roman Empire passed under a new rulership-The 
Leopard Beast— whose mouth was lion like, its body leopard like, 
and its feet bear like. This beast which came into possession of the 
Dragon's seat and power, we understand to be Papacy: it 
corresponds to the "man child" of the preceding chapter. It has 
certain qualities which resemble the first three beasts of Daniel 7, 
viz: the Lion, Bear and Leopard-described as representing 
Babylon, Persia, and Greece. This new Beast then, would combine 
certain leading characteristics of the preceding empires and unite 
them in the power of the last-the Roman. 

Babylon was celebrated for its splendor and its pride-the Lion the 
king or ruler of all beasts— so Papacy had a mouth of this sort, i. e. , 
it claimed to be the kingdom over all kingdoms by divine right-the 
kingdom of God, which was to break in pieces and consume all 
others— a strong mouth. 

The bear's feet suggest another of Papacy's peculiarities as an 
empire— viz: persistency. Like the Bear Empire (Medo Persia) 
which would besiege for years, and even turn a river aside from its 
channel to accomplish its ends; so Papacy moves cautiously, and 
gets possession of kingdoms rather by strategy than by battle. This 
same quality is illustrated in the bear; it hugs its prey to death with 
its paws. 

The body of the Papal beast was like a Leopard. The Leopard was 
the third beast seen by Daniel- viz: Grecia. Greece was noted as the 
center of learning, piety and wisdom (Acts 17:23): so Papacy's 
chief claim, to be the ruler of all kingdoms, is based on the claim 
that it is the center of wisdom, learning and piety. Other 
peculiarities of the Leopard are its activity, vigilance and 
secretiveness; so with Papacy. Again, a Leopard is spotted 
irregularly, so too Papacy's policy varies in various parts of the 
earth: In enlightened liberal countries it is liberal, in other places it 
varies in its rulings to suit the circumstances. 

This Leopard beast (Ecclesiastical Empire) is given the power, seat, 
and great authority of the [Dragon] Pagan Roman Empire, and for a 



time becomes the only representative of that dominion— the various 
horns (kingdoms) rendering allegiance and support to it. * 

"And the whole world wondered, after the beast, and they 
worshiped the Dragon because he gave the authority to the BEAST, 
saying, "Who is like unto the BEAST, and who is able to make war 
with him?" (Vs. 3,4.) 

The people respected this BEAST because of its peculiarities- 
leopard body and lion mouth-and they respected the civil power all 
the more, because it had so honored ecclesiastical authority. The 
various kingdoms (horns) soon learned that their hold of power 
over the people was strengthened, rather than weakened by 
allegiance to Papacy, for Papacy in turn recognized them and 
commanded the people to recognize those despots as of divine 
appointment. 

Thus it is, that to this day, the rulers of Europe claim to rule by 
divine right and appointment and their children after them, no 
matter how incapable. For the same reason the Protestant churches 
of Europe, to gain national favor, protection, and assistance, 
became State churches and they, as Papacy did, recognize the 
reigning families as possessed of Divine title to the office, and 
rulership of the people. [God's Word on the contrary, denounces all 
the governments of earth, as selfish, oppressive, and beastly, and 
recognizes only one kingdom as being of God's appointment, viz: 
the kingdom soon to be established in all the earth-Christ and his 
saints IN GLORY. (Danl. 7:27. Rev. 11:15. 2 Tim. 2:12.) It is in 
that kingdom only that the saints have their citizenship-it alone 
they recognize and for it pray "Thy kingdom COME. " 

B. But Bro. A. , has not the reign of that kingdom in some sense 
commenced? Do we not add in the same prayer Thine is the 
kingdom, etc. ? (Matt. 5:13, Luke 11:4.) 

A. No Brother, this is the time to suffer ignominy with him at the 
hands of the World, as a test of our worthiness to reign with him 
when he shall take (use) his great power and reign. It is not until 
about the close of the Seventh Trumpet's sounding, that the 
kingdoms of earth become the kingdoms of our Lord and his 
anointed (body— church). Then you know, we are told they will be 
angry and his wrath must first come before they are obedient. (Rev. 
11:18.) These are so deceived by this false teaching of Papacy, still 
continued to some extent, by all of the reformation churches, that it 
naturally 



*It should be remembered that the church of Rome consists only of 
the clergy-the Pope, the "Father" and all Bishops, Priests, Monks, 
etc. , "brothers. " 

R319 : page 6 



makes both people and rulers angry, to intimate that the Devil is the 
prince of these governments. (Eph. 2:2.) Certainly many of their 
deeds are worthy of such a diabolical head. 

As to your quotation from the Lord's prayer, "Thine is the kingdom, 
etc. ," you should remember that we found that to be an addition 
made to the original prayer during Papacy's rule. It is lacking in all 
ancient copies of the N. T. and is properly omitted in the new 
revision. No Brother, nothing in God's Word countenances the idea 
that these oppressive governments are God's, nor recognized by 
him except as parts of evil— to be wiped out by the exaltation of the 
real Christ, head and body, glorious spiritual beings, to the 
Ecclesiastical dominion which for several hundred years was 
counterfeited by Papacy-the chief Antichrist. 

But to return to the subject: The people respected the BEAST 
saying: "Who is able to make war with him? —who would be able 
to withstand the withering curse of Papacy, the spiritual empire? 

"And there was given him a mouth (Lion-like— strong— terrible 
utterance) speaking great and blasphemous things;" [The utterances 
we examined at our last interview, as you will recall. —Dec. '81.] 
"and authority was given him to act forty-two months. " (Vs. 
5.)This permission we understand to have been— to execute and put 
to death saints of God, which it called "heretics. "These 42 
symbolic months, or 1260 days are the same as mentioned in the 
preceding chapter and also foretold by Daniel (12:7) as 3-1/2 times 
(years). With the end of those 1260 years, Papacy's power to act-or 
execute for heresy, ended -1798. There the delusion that none 
could successfully war or contend with Papacy was shown, when 
Napoleon in defiance of the curse, took Pope Pius VI. a prisoner to 
Paris where he died. The dread of this BEAST has not been so great 
since, and the various horns (kingdoms) which once defended, have 
made war with the woman. (The dominion has been taken away.) 
(Rev. 17:16.) 

Now we turn back again to see how this BEAST succeeded during 
its career of power. We read (vs. 6): "And he opened his mouth in 
blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his 
tabernacle, and those who tabernacle in heaven. " 

This BEAST power was a slur upon God and upon the true coming 
kingdom. Verses 7 and 8 ("New Vers. " "Diaglott "rendering 
poor.)" And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and 
to overcome them; and there was given to him authority over every 
tribe and people and tongue and nation. "[Papacy's authority as a 
spiritual empire or "kingdom of God,"-was generally 
acknowledged. ] "And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him- 
-every one whose name hath not been written in the book of life, of 
the Lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world. " 

The deception of Papacy was so complete that the World was 
deceived and all the church, except the overcomers, whose names 
were "written in heaven" were deceived in the same way, and 



hasted to unite themselves with, and to worship the BEAST, and 
have it enroll their names on its books. From this has sprung the 
delusion so common to all Protestants at this day —viz: That their 
names must be connected with some SUCH earthly church system, 
or they are not the Lord's saints. But, the important item is, to have 
our names recorded in the Lamb's book of life-His is the only 
record of any value. 

"If any man hath an ear, let him hear. " (Vs. 9.)Only those whose 
ears had been circumcised— those who had come to a considerable 
knowledge of God's word and who had the hearing of faith-to 
respect him and his word, despite the magnificence, success and 
power of error, would be able to receive the foregoing statements 
concerning those who were deceived 

R319:page7 

by Papacy: that they were of those unwritten in the true church, of 
which that was the counterfeit. 

"If any one is for captivity, into captivity he goes away; if any one 
will kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is 
the patient endurance and the faith of the saints. " (Vs. 10.) 

The Papal system was one of bondage. All who acknowledged its 
claims must of necessity render implicit obedience, as unto God; 
for it claimed to be the Kingdom of Heaven; and its head, the Pope, 
to be God's vicegerent; consequently those who were for, or in 
favor of such a captivity of individual thought, and who 
acknowledged the right of that Papal system to limit and define the 
faith of all, by consenting, became captives. 

Many Protestant sects have got into the same snare of the devil, and 
are vainly striving to make a dominion by blending church and 
state. 

On the other hand, there were some who asserted that Papacy was a 
usurpation of the titles and power of the true head and ruler of the 
church, and claimed their right to the individual liberty wherewith 
Christ had made them free. Such used, the "sword of the spirit, 
which is the Word of God," in the defense of their liberty, and such 
were put to death by Papacy-it overcame the saints during its 1 260 
years of power. This was a severe test of true saintship— Would they 
go into captivity and join in the usurpers ranks, or would they 
remain faithful to the true king and wait for the kingdom which he 
promised to establish? Those whose names were written in heaven, 
stuck to the sword and sealed their testimonies by death. 

THE TWO-HORNED BEAST. 

"And I saw another wild beast ascending from the earth, and he 
had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. " (Vs. 1 l.)If 
the preceding wild beast represented an ecclesiastical power, as we 
have just seen, then this beast called another should be understood 
to represent a similar ecclesiastical or church power. 



As the first beast had ten horns, or powers which gave it their 
strength and protection, so this beast has "two horns" which 
indicates that two powers or governments will support it. 

B. Could this refer to Mohammedanism? 

A. No, I think not; this revelation was not given to be a general 
history of the world, but was a revelation given to the church, and 
relates to matters and things closely related to the church's history. 
There is no reason, for giving an account of Mohammedanism; for 
the same reason that it would have been useless to give a history of 
Confucianism, or Buddhism. None of these were Christian systems, 
and though they were all anti-christian, yet they were openly so and 
not so harmful to real Christianity. Papacy on the contrary, is 
mentioned because it attempted to palm itself off as the kingdom of 
Christ and to deceive, while really, it was the Dragon or Roman 
Empire united to an apostasy. 

Again, notice that this beast "ascended (came gradually) out of the 
earth," while the first one came out of the Sea. Now, if our 
definitions of these symbols be correct— as the coming of Papacy 
from among the irreligious masses of the Roman empire, was 
shown by its coming out of the "sea," then the coming of this 
second beast out of the "earth" should signify that it sprung up 
among a professedly religious people. 

B. I see the force of this: But can it refer to any of the branches of 
the Protestant churches? 

A. I understand that the wounding of the Papal head, (referred to in 
vs. 3,) by the sword, (vs. 14) refers to the Reformation work, when 
Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Knox, and others, by advocating the 
teachings of the Word of God, as opposed to the teachings of 
Papacy, showed that it was the system referred to in Revelations, 
and in Paul's writings called the "Mystery of Iniquity"— "Anti- 
Christ" -"The Man of Sin. "They struck so mightily at this Papal 
head, that the system had well nigh died; but as the cause of the 
Protest-ants became more popular, the sympathies of some in 
power came to be exercised on their behalf. Soon various small 
German kingdoms (princedom's) were found on the side of the 
Reformers, and lent their sanction to them rather than to Papacy. 
Soon Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and others, 
withdrew all allegiance to their former head and RULER-the Pope; 
and though not acknowledging Luther, Calvin, or other, as a new 
head or spiritual emperor, they supported the various Reformation 
churches with state funds and protection. About this time also, (A. 
D. 1531) the church in England threw off her allegiance to Rome 
and became a separate ecclesiastical government. It thus followed 
exactly the example of Papacy, in blending civil with ecclesiastical 
power, and made the same person, Henry VIII. and his successors, 
head of all power. 

The effect of this governmental favor upon the teachings of the 
reformers, can well be imagined. Once they had complained about 



empire and church being united in Papacy; had shown that the 
Virgin espoused to Christ awaiting His kingdom, was unfaithful to 
him (therefore termed a Harlot) when she united with, and leaned 
for support upon earthly powers. This part of their smiting with the 
"Sword of the Spirit," soon ceased, as they began to regard the 
favor and smile of earthly governments upon themselves. They 
could not consistently condemn in Papacy, what they themselves 
had come to enjoy and crave. It was their desire (lust) for power, 
name, and influence, to do a great work, and have many children, 
that led these daughters of Rome to follow the example of their 
mother- "Babylon the great, the mother of harlots. " (Rev. 17:5.) 

But, Brother B. , do not forget that we are now talking of church 
SYSTEMS, and not of all who are under, or bound by, and serving 
those systems. We believe that the Lord has had dear children in all 
of these (Papal mother, as well as her daughters), who, in 
supporting them, verily think they do God service. This is the 
delusion which induced all but a few to respect the Papal BEAST as 
the 

R320 : page 7 

true empire of Christ, instead of waiting for "the Lord from heaven. 
" From that ancient snare and deception of the devil, all the 
consecrated saints need to be liberated, and nothing but truth can 
liberate. The coming out of Babylon was commenced by the 
Reformers; but, as we have seen, their followers made only a brief 
journey, until to a great extent they fell into the same "snare of the 
fowler. " 

B. There are some who have evidently made more progress than 
those state churches you refer to in Europe. All the churches in U. 
S. of America are free and unsupported by the government. 

A. Yes, knowledge and liberty in general are opponents of religious 
bondage and bigotry; but in many of these free organizations it is 
more because they cannot, than that they would not be supported 
by, and united to, civil power. 

B. Well, now I am anxious to find proof of the second- the TWO 
HORNED BEAST. It cannot be all of those churches, can it?It must 
be some one church system, just as Papacy was one church system. 

A. Exactly, it is one ecclesiastical system; and the two horns show 
that it is supported, and its authority recognized by two kingdoms. 

B. Let me see: the Presbyterian church is the established church of 
Scotland, but of no other country; that would be but one horn. The 
Dutch Reformed church is the established church of a number of 
countries; that would be too many; and the same is true of the 
Lutheran. 

A. Hold on, Bro. B. !You fall into a very natural mistake. 
Remember that to be simply aided, or supported by the empire does 
not make a symbolic "BEAST"; no, a BEAST is a government, and 



to become a symbolic beast, a church must needs become an 
element in, or part of the government. This was not the case in 
those you have mentioned. No, there is but one church which this 
symbol fits perfectly, viz. : The established "Church of England and 
Ireland. " This system, like the Papal, was a blending of church and 
state— an ecclesiastical empire. 

In the year 1200 England became subject to the Pope. In 1531, 
owing to a dispute between her king, Henry Vm. , and the Pope, 
England withdrew from allegiance to Papacy. The Convocation of 
its clergy, called the same year, in its decrees, declared King Henry 
VIII. to be "The one protector of the English Church, its only and 
SUPREME LORD; and as far as might be, by the law of Christ, 
ITS SUPREME HEAD. "I quote the very words. 

B. I am astonished; why those are the exact sentiments of Papacy; 
that is exactly the sense in which the Pope is recognized as Christ's 
Vicegerent. What a glorious representative of Jesus they had in 
Henry VIII. , who, out of six wives, was divorced from two; 
beheaded two; and by many is supposed to have poisoned one. He 
was a worthy rival of some of the Popes as an Anti-christian 
claimant of headship to the church. 

B. The reformation movement had not reached England at this time, 
and certainly it was much needed. The Clerical Convocation which 
could acknowledge such a head was certainly not far from being as 
corrupt as Papacy. 

The fact that the title, "head of the church," was not an empty 
honor, may be judged from the historian's words- "At the same time 
it was ordained that no regard should be paid to censures which the 
Pope might pass on account of this law, and that Mass should be 
said and sacraments administered as usual. In 1534 all payments 
made to the apostolic chamber, and dispensations were abolished; 
monasteries were subjected to royal government, and exempted 
from all other; the right to summon Convocations, approve or reject 
canons [laws or doctrines enacted by the Convocation of clergy] 
and hear appeals from the Bishops, was vested in the King alone. 
Though now honored with the title of SUPREME HEAD OF THE 
CHURCH ON EARTH, Henry contemplated no change in the 
doctrines of the church; as then held. Indeed, it was not until 30 
years or more after these steps, that the Roman Catholics and the 
Reformers [of the English Church] were looked upon as separate 
bodies, or had separate ministrations and separate places of 
worship. " 

Relative to the establishment of "the Church of England" as 
separate from the Papal church, another historian says: 
"Convocation declared that the Pope had no more authority in 
England, than any other bishop. The act of supremacy was passed, 
making Henry the head of the church, which act has been described 
as the epitome of all the measures which had been passed against 
the encroachments of the spiritual powers [of Rome] within and 



without the realm; and, as being at once, the symbol of the 
independence of England, and the declaration that thenceforth the 
civil magistrate was supreme within the English dominions over 
church as well as state. " 

B. I am inclined to think that these matters are very imperfectly 
understood by people in general. But are the same titles- "Supreme 
head of the church on earth," etc. , still applied to English 
sovereigns? 

A. Yes; and furthermore the crown worn shows the title, for it is 
surmounted by a cross. And the present "Great Seal of England," 
besides describing Victoria as the defender of the faith, illustrates it 
by a picture of the Queen, supported on either side by figures 
representing Justice and Religion, which sit at her feet. The Queen 
is shown as holding in her hand a globe (representing the earth), the 
upper half of which is light colored (representing Christianity), and 
this surmounted by a cross which in symbol declares her to be the 
supporter or head of the church universal. 

This is the same exactly, as you see in the hands of the Popes in 
many pictures. It represents as a whole that this head of the church 
on earth, is the upholder, supporter of the truth. 

Now, I need not remark that Jesus never gave this office to any one, 
but claims it himself; and any others who claim it are usurpers. Paul 
said: "Christ is the head of the church; " and that we are to "grow up 
into him in all things, which is the head even Christ. "Again he 
repeats that God "gave Him to be the Head over all things to the 
church, which is His body. " (Eph. 1:22; and 4:15; and 5:23; and 
Col. 1:18. )It is the church on earth that Paul is speaking of, hence 
any Pope, Queen, Council, Assembly, Conference, or any other 
man or company of men, who claim or exercise the powers of the 
true HEAD-Jesus, are opposing him. And all who support such by 
influence, presence, or money, are abettors of evil, and supporters 
of false SYSTEMS. 

B. Now let us proceed— I am anxious to see whether this system 
(the English Church) fills the picture fully. The second BEAST had 
two horns; what two kingdoms (horns) supported this Church? 
Surely not Scotland; it has persistently refused its support and 
recognizes and supports the Presbyterian Church. 

A. Don't forget the distinction we noticed between a church 
supported by a government, as in Scotland, and 

R320 : page 8 

a church united in the government, as in England— we have seen 
that it is the latter relationship which constitutes a BEAST. 

Now let us see about the two horns: England of course was one of 
them, and I think I can give you satisfactory evidence that Ireland 
was the other. History says that in 1537 the Irish Parliament in 
Dublin "passed the act of supremacy, declaring Henry VIII. 



SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH, prohibiting intercourse 
with the court of Rome, and making it treason to refuse the oath of 
supremacy. "Henry VIII. also took the title of King of Ireland. " 
Thus we see that the second horn came up within the brief space of 
five years after the first. 

B. That fits well, indeed. The fact that Ireland was not a powerful 
horn matters not, for it was stronger than some that supported the 
Papal beast. I never saw a better case; surely we have, beyond a 
question, the SECOND BEAST, which has so puzzled all the 
commentators, though they saw clearly that Papacy was the 
Leopard. What effect results, from the disestablishment of the 
Church in Ireland? 

A. From 1538 to 1871-333 years -the title of the church was "The 
Church of England and Ireland," thus recognizing both horns. " 

On January 1, 1871 (by action of parliament and the consent of the 
Queen, the head of the church) the Irish Church was disestablished, 
or that horn cast off. So, too, all of the horns which once supported 
Papacy have broken off from her; the difference being that in 
Papacy's case the horns have turned against her, and in the case of 
the second BEAST it casts off the Irish horn of itself, believing it to 
be a weakness rather than a strength. And it would not be at all 
remarkable if the second horn (England) would be separated from 
this beast (i. e. , it would not be surprising if soon the church were 
to be separated from the state in England.)The "two horns like a 
lamb," would seem to indicate that this BEAST would be peaceably 
inclined-not inclined to be aggressive, but merely using the horns 
for defense. 

B. I cannot see how the next part fits-He spake like the Dragon. 
This would seem to mark its utterances as being worse than 
Papacy's, which is not true. 

A. But notice that it does not say the, but a dragon. We understand 
this to mean simply that its utterances resembled those of a purely 
civil (dragon) power, and in its words there would be little, to 
denote that it is an ecclesiastical government. All know how true 
this is. 

"And all the authority of the first beast [Papacy] he executes in his 
presence [this shows that the second does not take the place of the 
first beast, but that they exist contemporaneously], and makes the 
earth and those who dwell in it to worship [respect] 

R321 : page 8 

the first beast whose mortal wound was healed. " 

B. I can see, I think, how that verse was fulfilled. The Church of 
England claimed all the powers and authority which Papacy 
claimed. It claimed to be THE church; it acknowledged and 
repudiated some of the corruptions complained of by the reformers, 
such as the sale of indulgences, transubstantiation, etc. , and 



abandoned those as well as the name Roman, for which they 
substituted the word HOLY, calling it the original "Holy Catholic 
Church. "It claims the same governmental authority and the same 
veneration for its decrees as Papacy. * 

And by establishing a similar system, devoid of some of the grosser 
Papal errors, it attracted attention of all to those errors, as being the 
only possible fault of Papacy. And when some of those errors were 
shortly after discarded by Papacy, the inference was that both 
BEAST systems were right. People at that day, as now, seemed to 
think those systems proper and right, if their powers, etc. , were 
properly exercised; but from God's standpoint the systems are 
abominations, and wrong from the very center. 

The systems are based upon errors, and, like a corrupt tree, "cannot 
bring forth good fruit. " 

B. Name the principal error. 

A. The very basis of both those systems, is their claim to be the 
"Kingdom of God" in reigning power. That idea once admitted 
justifies their persecution of individuals and nations, forcing them 
to submit and bow in obedience. Scripture accords those powers to 
the "kingdom of God"-when "the kingdom is the Lords, and he is 
the Governor among the nations; all the ends of the world shall 
remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the 
nations shall worship before thee. " Psa. 22:27,28. He shall "dash 
them in pieces as a potter's vessel. " Psa. 2:9. Unto him every knee 
shall bow and every tongue confess. (Phil. 2:1 1.) And if their claim 
be GOOD, who can object to them for carrying out the scriptural 
statements? 

B. These Anti-christs, to make their claims of kingdom power 
appear true, had simply to take another step in compelling 
obedience, backing up their right to do so, by the Scriptures just 
quoted. And not only was this great evil sanctioned, but their claim 
once admitted, that the kingdom was established and the reign in 
progress, those who admitted it were hindered from looking for the 
true HEAD of the church; to set up the true kingdom under the 
whole heavens, which SHALL break in pieces present imperfect 
governments— establish righteousness in the earth and cause every 
knee to bow and every tongue to confess to the glory of God. 

A. Yes, I agree with you; the next verses say, "And he does great 
signs, so that even fire he makes to come down from heaven to the 
earth in presence of men. " (Vs. 13.)This government, like Papacy's 
claimed heavenly power, and its denunciations, were regarded as 
from heaven, judgments or fire being called down upon offenders. 

"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by the signs which 
it was given him to do in the presence of the [first] BEAST. " (Vs. 
14.)We make a distinction between the earth and those who dwell 
on it. As the EARTH symbolizes those obedient to and supporting 
the BEAST, so "those dwelling on the earth," we understand to 



mean independent Christians who do not support either of these 
systems. 

THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST. 

"Saying to them that dwell on the earth [independent companies of 
Christians] that they should make an IMAGE TO THE BEAST 
[Papacy], which had the wound by a sword and did live. "She 
advised this by her example. From the year 1 800 to 1 846 was a 
time in which great numbers of new sects arose, whereas before 
that they were few and prominent. This gave rise to uneasiness 
among the various older denominations, who wondered whereunto 
this thing would lead. As the Bible came to be read more and more 
by the masses, occasional individuals would feel free to preach 
what they thought it taught, regardless of denominational creeds 
and the views of older sects. As a consequence Protestants were fast 
splitting up into fragments. They began to say, By what means shall 
we check and stop this disposition to individual thought and 
opinion relative to the teachings of Scripture? They wanted to stop 
the very thing God desired, viz. : that each individual should be free 
and independent of restraint, with his faith based, not on the views 
of others, not on the decisions of councils or presbyteries, nor in the 
decision of the Pope, nor in the things approved of the HEAD of the 
English Church, but in the WORD OF GOD. 

The question came— How can we restrain these preachers? This was 
a quandary to all except the Roman and Episcopal Churches, since 
these both claimed the "Apostolic Succession," and that this by 
ordination, conferred upon their ministers special power and 
authority to preach and to administer the "Sacraments"; hence that 
no others had a right to do so, but were clerical pretenders. Other 
denominations could not claim this continuation of apostolic power 
through their preachers, but simply set them apart by prayer, 
consequently those of one denomination could not object, that the 
preachers of other denominations, as well as all laymen, were not as 
truly authorized of God to expound the Scriptures as their own 
clergy. 

But the example of the church of England showed what a prestige 
she had by reason of the voice of authority with which she 
commanded a reverence for her clergy and her teachings. This 
teaching by example was not lost. The various denominations felt a 
necessity for some common STANDARD OF DOCTRINE which 
would be supported and upheld by all of them, and thus give 
prestige to their teachings, and bring the combined influence of all, 
AGAINST ANY FURTHER ADVANCE IN KNOWLEDGE or the 
development of any different phase of TRUTH. Thus they would 
protect themselves by being able to say-The combined opinion of 
all Protestants is against you; therefore you are HERETICS, and 
therefore we will shun you, and not call you brethren, but use all 
our influence against you. 



This was done by the formation in 1846, of the "Evangelical 
Alliance. " It was stated to be one of the objects of the Alliance 
(and we believe the principal one) to "Promote between the 
different EVANGELICAL denominations, an effective co- 
operation in the efforts to REPEL COMMON ENEMIES and 
DANGERS. " 

B. I do not understand you to oppose the Christians represented in 
that alliance, but their attempt to muzzle truth, and to prevent the 
opening up of any other truths buried by Papacy, than those which 
they had received. 

A. Quite right, it is far from my wish to say they purposely 
combined against the unfolding of truth, nor would I say this of 
Papists. But I do say, that by their action they were following 
Papacy's tactics, and that in that Alliance they did make, the- 
IMAGE OF THE BEAST. 

And they have been in great measure successful. Very few 
denominations have sprung up since that Alliance put its measuring 
line upon men's minds, to decide what was, and what was not 
Evangelical, regardless of whether it be Scriptural or not. It has 
tended to make a separation clear and distinct between Clergy and 
Laity, as though they were of different races. 

How much the IMAGE resembles the Papal BEAST may be judged 
from the fact that Papacy acknowledged the image— owned it as a 
creditable likeness-by the Pope's sending "GREETINGS" to the 
last meeting of the "Ev. Alliance"- 1879. Strange to say the 
delegates to the Alliance had so far lost sight of the principles and 
doctrines which led to the protests against the Papal church, (that it 
was the Harlot church- Anti-Christ and Man of sin, mentioned in 
Scripture) that they actually felt FLATTERED by the Pontiffs 
notice, instead of becoming alarmed and examining how and WHY 
he who is "THE (chief) Antichrist," should feel pleased to greet 
them as follows. A prominent Presbyterian minister present at the 
above named meeting, mentioned the "Pope's Greeting" with 
evident pleasure and satisfaction, to the writer. 

A prominent characteristic of the BEAST copied by the image is 
the honoring of the special class, the clergy, with special honors 
and titles. They are known as Revs. , Divines, etc. , but Jesus THE 
divine, said: "Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I 
am. ""Be not ye called Rabbi, neither be ye called Master, for one is 
your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren" (Matt. 23:8). 
These titles are assumptions fashioned after those of Papacy. 

When the various denominations began their existence, more full of 
the spirit of Christ they claimed no such high sounding titles. The 

Reformers were not known as Rev. , D. D. , &c. , but 

as John Knox, Martin Luther, John Wesley, &c. Unpretentious, like 
Jesus and the Apostles, they were intent upon serving God and 
therefore became the servants (ministers) of the church. These had 
marks of God's approval, and as a result, their ministry was 



wonderfully blest. But now the clergy are far from being servants, 
they are Lords. They have itching ears, loving the approval of men. 
As pride and worldliness have come in, vital godliness and power 
have gradually departed. 

For the very same reason, they are losing all power to expound the 
Word of God-the gift of teaching-because "God abhorreth the 
proud but giveth grace (favor) to the humble. "The early reformers 
were humble, and God led them into much knowledge of His Word, 
and although we are much farther along "the path of the just," and 
the servants should have 

R322 : page 8 

more light, yet we find ministers of all denominations ready to 
confess their ignorance of the Word. They appeal for their 
information, back to the early reformers, and thus confess that they 
have less light than they. Pride always has hindered growth in grace 
and does now. "How can ye believe who receive honor one of 
another, and seek not the honor which comes from God, only?" 
That their light should grow dim 

R322 : page 9 

and their spiritual life become dwarfed is the natural result of their 
joining the IMAGE and subscribing to creeds made in the fifteenth 
century, which, like the iron shoe of China, will not admit of any 
growth. It is a shoe a little larger than Papacy put upon its 
followers, but of the same sort. 

Papacy established the clerical hierarchy, who lord it over God's 
heritage instead of serving their brethren as Jesus explained- "One 
is your Master and all ye are brethren," and as Paul said- We are to 
speak the truth in love and "grow up into Him in all things who is 
the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body fitly joined 
together (not by creeds of men, but by love begotten by the one 
Spirit of truth) and compacted by that which every joint supplieth. " 
(Every joint is every member, not the clergy only.)"Maketh 
increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. "Thus 
coming "to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son 
of God. "Eph 4:15,16. 

As Papacy established the priesthood over the church, so 
Protestantism has established almost the same, and there is no 
opportunity for the body to edify itself, every joint taking part. 
True, there is a seeming show of liberty at prayer-meetings, etc. , 
but it is only upon the surface, for the ordained pastor is to watch 
zealously lest anything contrary to the teachings of his church 
should be expressed, and if so to silence the audacious member at 
once, for the church creed is the rule, not the Word of God. If this is 
not sufficient, they must have a sort of church trial and 
excommunicate him ["kill him"]. The trial, by the way, gives 
evidence of another likeness to the beast, namely, the exaltation of 



the teachings of the organization above the Word of God, for all 
such are tried according to "the authorities" of their church. 

"And it was given him [the two horned beast] to give life to the 
image of the Beast. " (Vs. 15.) 

It may not be known to many how much stress was laid upon the 
"Apostolic succession," which was supposed to be a virtue 
transmitted through hundreds of years of Papal corruption, by the 
laying on of the hands of Bishops. This, of course, was vested in the 
Roman church and also in the English church, on account of its 
being at first, rather a secession from Papacy, than a reformation. 

To many minds, even among the clergy, there was a veneration for 
that ceremony, which neither Papacy nor the English Church were 
averse to promoting. 

In the introduction of Methodism in the United States much 
difficulty was experienced because of Mr. John Wesley's 
superstition on this subject. He would not sanction the giving of the 
"Sacrament" by any except those ordained by the holy hands of an 
Episcopal Bishop. Thus up to 1784, Methodists could only partake 
of the Sacraments from Episcopal ministers (ordained). The 
independence war tended to make the Methodist preachers 
independent, and the expediency of taking the authority was 
discussed. John Wesley heard of this, and applied to the English 
Church to have at least one Methodist minister ordained for the 
American Church. Finally, in despair, he did the best he knew how 
to patch up an "apostolic succession. "He with two other ministers 
(none of them bishops) ordained Thomas Coke to the office of 
Bishop, and from this sprang the office of Bishop in the M. E. 
Church. 

I relate this only to show the superstition of even so great and good 
men as the Wesleys, on this subject. 

Now, none of these allied sects had the succession except the 
Episcopal, and its recognition of the Alliance (Image) gave it 
vitality-breath- authority, "That the image of the beast should both 
speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the IMAGE 
OF THE BEAST, should be killed. " (Vs. 15.) 

The worship and the killing are symbolic as well as the Image, and 
this signifies that all who will not bow to the decrees of the 
Evangelical Alliance shall be esteemed as heretics, shunned and 
cast out by all who are ORTHODOX, (?) i. e. , all who worship its 
decrees and agree to believe neither more nor less than is stated in 
its nine articles of creed. Now the various sects have a sort of 
backing in this organization, and each may act as the mouthpiece of 
the Image, in denouncing as heresy, all matter not included in this 
general creed, and in cutting off or ecclesiastically beheading those 
who differ. (See Rev. 20:4.) 



B. I see, and to be cut off from any one church now, implies 
dismemberment from all orthodox churches; which implies of 
course, that you are a heretic, and not at all a son of God. 

A. Yes, to all who regard these earthly institutions as the real 
churches; but to those of us who regard only the heavenly 
organization, and who look for the smile of the true Head of the 
church only, and who accept His Word as the only limitation of 
faith and knowledge; such cannot worship either the BEAST or his 
IMAGE, after they come to realize it, but will "worship God" only. 

IMAGE worship is hindering hundreds from seeing the beauties of 
the Word of God. They may perhaps glance at it, and for a moment 
think for themselves, but that is all. The church discipline is so 
strict, and they reverence it so much, that a look or frown is 
sufficient to warn them that independent thought is a dangerous 
thing, and must not be indulged in, lest they be regarded as infidels. 
Would that all could see that these local organizations called 
churches are not THE CHURCH, but that the Church of God 
includes all Christians, all whose names are written in Heaven, and 
that when these local organizations attempt to come between them 
as children, and God their Father, or to put their creed instead of the 
Word of God, their assumed authority is not to be recognized, nor 
tolerated; and that it is our duty to rebuke it as sinful. 

"And he causes all, the little [humble] and the great, the rich and the 
poor, and the freemen and bondmen, that they should give 
themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead; so that 
no one may be able to buy or sell unless he who has the MARK- 
the name of the beast or the number of his name. " (Vss. 16,17.) 

All classes of Christians must bow; all must, in some way, give 
evidence of their support of the Image and consecration to its 
interests and laws; either a public, open profession of being 
members of the alliance, and hence supporters (mark in forehead) 
or at least a giving of some assistance and influence to the 
principles of Image organization- (the right hand support). 

B. How about the buying and selling? 

A. That, like the other features, is symbolic: The buying and 
selling, refers to dealing in spiritual things. None may be 
recognized as having any right to teach or preach or baptize or 
administer the emblems of our Lord's death, except those 
LICENSED to do so by some orthodox member of the Image. And 
acts of such persons are not counted valid. 

B. Truly these things fit together wonderfully; nor should it surprise 
us that in giving an account of the church and its later times, all 
three of these great systems should be mentioned thus by our Lord. 
The English Church system is certainly a BEAST in the same sense 
as Papacy was, with the different characteristics noted; and the 
Evangelical Alliance is certainly a perfect IMAGE of it. It is what 
in politics or business would be termed a "ring "-a religious ring or 



monopoly, organized to hinder others from going into the work of 
truth seeking. 

A. You will notice that this 17th verse indicates that the name is the 
mark— the name of the Beast or the number of his name. "The next 
verse seems to indicate, that this name and number are, in some 
sense, a secret, and that it will indicate wisdom, or a correct 
knowledge of the foregoing symbols, if we are able to solve the 
mystery of the name which is symbolically given as 666. "Here is 
wisdom. Let him who has understanding [of the foregoing symbol, 
prove it by a proper application of the following number] compute 
the number of the Beast, for it is a man's number [or reckoned after 
a human manner]; and his number is 666. 

"THE NAME OF THE BEAST, 
OR THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME. " 

B. Have you been able to decipher the name and number? I have 
heard of many who have tried all sorts of names and applications, 
but none of them ever seemed reasonable to me. 

A. The same has been my difficulty. A little over a year ago I spoke 
on the subject of this same chapter to the name- less little company 
of "this way," in Lynn, Mass. , and concluded my remarks by 
telling them that I had never seen a satisfactory explanation of the 
666. And, though I thought I had given a correct analysis of the 
symbols of the chapter, yet I could not claim it to be wisdom, since 
I could not interpret the number. I suggested, however, that if ours 
be the correct understanding of the time in which we are living-the 
"harvest" of the age-and if our general application of these 
symbols be correct, the number should soon be understood. I urged 
examination on the subject by all, for the Lord is sometimes pleased 
to give wisdom through the weakest of his children. "Out of the 
mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained praise. " 

R323 : page 9 

About three months after, I received a long letter from one of the 
thinking brethren of that place, saying that he thought he had the 
key; and I think he has; it certainly fits the lock in every particular. 
I will give it to you very much as he suggested it. His process of 
reasoning was as follows: 

Jesus, who gave this revelation to us (Rev. 1:1), well knew that this 
symbol could not be understood until about the present time, for the 
reason that the Image was only made in 1846. Jesus also knew, of 
course, that English would be the language used by probably four- 
fifths of his earnest truth-seeking children, in the "time of the end. 
"He knew, also, that not many wise, not many great, not many 
learned in all languages would be of the chosen "little flock. " 
Moreover, it was his custom to adapt his teachings to the "common 
people," and of this sort his Jewels have been from, the twelve 
disciples and since. 



Therefore it would appear that the number 666, should be open to 
the comprehension of us all— we being the ones told to count— as 
much so as were the other symbolic numbers of Danl. and Rev. Let 
us try, then, to apply these figures in English. *[This is the first 
application in English, known to the writer, but the reasonableness 
of it is obvious. ] 

First, then, the number is that of the [first] BEAST. Let us see 
whether it will apply to some of its names, That system which Paul 
calls the man of sin is the 

Roman Catholic power = 666. 

123456 123456 123456 
He is in Revelation called a BEAST 

Roman Catholic "Beast" = 666. 
The system is also called the "woman" (Rev. 17:18) 

Roman Catholic "woman" = 666. 
She calls herself the 

"Holy Catholic Church" = 666. 
She is really and truly (Rev. 17:5) 

"The Mother of Harlots" = 666. 

Thus we see that the number fits the BEAST well. 

The second BEAST was anxious to have exactly the same name, 
and in fact it claimed to have the pre-eminent right to the name- 

"Holy Catholic church," = 666. 

Other names by which it is often known, are- 

"English State Church," = 666. 

"The Episcopal Church," = 666. 

"Episcopalian Church," = 666. 

"The Church of England," = 666. 

This application of the number, will doubtless appear to some too 
simple to be accepted, but thus God ever deals with us-hiding truth 
under the vail of its own simplicity, so that it may appear to the 
Greek (worldly wise) foolishness, but unto them which believe (not 
to those who believe without evidence, but who believe on the 
strongest kind of evidence -the harmony of His Word) the power 
of God, and the wisdom of God. (1 Cor. 1:23.) 

The Image causes all who claim relationship, or whom it 
recognizes, as having a right to buy or sell— teach— to have as a 
creed, that which shall mark them as having either "the name" of 
the BEAST, or the "number" of his name— 666. Many take the name 
and in their creeds recite, "I believe in the 



"Holy Catholic Church" = 666. 

Among those who thus openly mark themselves in their forehead 
(by their creeds) are Episcopalians, Methodists, Presbyterians and 
others. But others give a seeming support (mark in their hand) to 
the general principal by organizing under various sectarian names. 
After these are blended in the IMAGE, (and no one would be 
admitted to membership in the Evangelical Alliance, unless he be a 
member of some such sect), they all are collectively known as the 

"Protestant Churches," = 666. Which we see contains the Beast's 
number. 

If we for instance were to organize, though we protest more than all 
others against the errors of Rome, and 

R323 : page 10 

also against the errors of the Image and second BEAST, yet we 
would not be reckoned one of the "Protestant churches," because 
we would not be recognized as orthodox— They would not count our 
organization a church. 

Should you inquire for our meetings and ask-Is that a protestant 
church which meets here? the answer would come— Oh, no; they are 
not Evangelical. They have no creed to mark them, so that the 
Alliance can decide whether they are an Evangelical Protestant 
Church or not. 

B. This does truly seem wonderful. I can see how some have it in 
their foreheads, making manifest by their creeds, forms, and titles, 
that which marks them as being partakers of some of the 
abominations of system and doctrine, which for centuries has been 
the mark of the Leopard BEAST. 

I can see, too, as I never saw before, that many of the mightiest 
WORKERS in the nominal church are working for their own 
section, arm or branch of this Image. I can see how much of what 
purports to be WORK FOR JESUS, may in reality, be devotion and 
sacrifice to the building up of a sect, or the carrying out of some 
humanly imposed burden. 

But I think we should always discriminate between the SYSTEMS, 
and those dear ones, some of whom seem to possess so much of the 
Spirit of Christ, who are bound by them. 

A. I fully agree with you; the distinction should be always 
remembered. But let me say that I think quite a good many, are still 
connected with and lending their names and influence to these 
organizations, which are BEAST marked, who are in heart out of 
all sympathy with them, and who hate as anti-Christ, every system 
which would in any sense take the place of the true HEAD of the 
church; and who will neither worship Conferences, Presbyteries, or 
Popes, but who "worship God. "These, however, are fast becoming 
aware that membership in the true church, (whose names are 
written in heaven,) is in no way affected by the disfellowship of the 



various human organizations, each calling itself the true church. 
They are learning too, that the true communion of saints and union 
of hearts, is dependent, not on creeds to bind together as members 
of ONE BODY, but on love and common interest in the HEAD and 
in each other, in whom we find the head's spirit of love and 
obedience to the Father's word. 

B. I know that you believe the Jewish Church to have been a picture 
or shadow of the nominal Gospel Church. Do you find any parallel 
to this Image worship in the shadow? 

A. Yes, Israel was carried captive to Babylon; there an Image was 
set up, and all were commanded to worship it. 

We have heretofore seen that Babylon, to be a type, or shadow of 
the nominal church. It is for this reason that the name Babylon is 
applied to it in Revelation. Papacy's was the greatest confusion or 
mixture of church and world, but all the reforms have been but 
partial, and the reformed churches are in much of the same 
confused (Babylon) condition. Papacy was "Babylon the GREAT" 
(Rev. 17:5), but in the time of "HARVEST" the Lord calls the 
entire system BABYLON. Here, as in the shadow, the command 
first comes for all to worship the HEAD of Babylon (Papacy), and 
afterward an IMAGE was made, and all were commanded to 
worship it. In the first type, Daniel alone refused to worship any but 
the true God. (Dan. 6:7. )In the second type there were more- the 
three "Israelites indeed," refused to worship the Image. (Dan. 3:18.) 
So, too, the number of true ones who are not worshiping the Image 
now, are probably three to one, who did not worship the Beast. For 
their refusal they were bound and cast into a fiery furnace. So here 
those who do not worship the IMAGE are bound, hindered, their 
influence circumscribed, and they are speedily in a "FIERY 
FURNACE"-of tribulation, either in their families or communities 
or in their business. In the words of Revelation— they are killed and 
hindered from buying and selling. But behold, they were unharmed 
by the fire; it will soon be manifest to all, that they are not bound, 
and furthermore that there is with them the form of the FOURTH. 
Yes, the HEAD-the TRUE HEAD is with those who will not bow 
when all others bow; who heed not the enchanting music of the 
hour; these are overcomers. (See Dan. 3:6.) 

As in the type deliverance came, so in the antitype, deliverance will 
fully come— the first resurrection glory-to those who have "not 
worshiped the BEAST, neither his IMAGE, neither had received 
his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and THEY lived 
and reigned with Christ a thousand years-this is the first 
resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that have part in the first 
resurrection. " Rev. 20:4-6.

B. O, my brother, I realize that the victor, in God's sight, is no half- 
hearted, no half-consecrated one, but one willing and glad to follow 
the Word of his God, and trust in it though opposed by all the 



Scribes, Pharisees, and hypocrites-those who will be tested in their 
love and respect for God by the strongest attachments, and yet 
prove themselves faithful by overcoming. 

A. Yes, brother- 

R323 : page 10 

Dare to be a Daniel, 

Dare to stand alone; 

Dare to have your purpose firm, 

And dare to make it known. " 



*This superstition as to the authority of the Church of England is 
seen to-day, even among intelligent persons— New translations of 
the Scriptures are refused, and the King James' Version preferred, 
because forsooth it was authorized to be read by the mighty King 
James, the HEAD OF "THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND 
IRELAND. " 



*In the common version and in the more modern Greek texts, this 
number is spelled out, six hundred and sixty-six; but in the ancient 
Greek MSS. the numerals are used, 666. 



R324 : page 10 

RANSOM OR PARDON--WHICH? 

The failure to discern the distinction between ransom and pardon, 
has led to much confession of faith. Christian people of general 
intelligence will quote texts relative to our being ransomed from the 
tomb, redeemed from death, bought with a price, even the precious 
blood of Christ, etc. , and in the same breath they speak of the 
Father's gracious pardon of all offences. Seemingly few seem to 
think, for many must know, that pardon and ransom, express 
exactly opposite thoughts. 

Webster defines ransom, to mean— "to redeem from captivity, or to 
forfeit by paying an equivalent. " 

His definition of redeem, is- "to purchase back, to regain 
possession of by paying of a stipulated price. " 

His definition of Pardon is— "to remit the penalty" or "to suffer to 
pass without punishment" -"to refrain from exacting a penalty. " 

The most ordinary thinker must see, that these words are as 
opposite as could be; all can see that both could not be true of the 
same thing. If Jesus did redeem us— ransom us, by paying an 
equivalent, thus purchasing the release from death, then our Father 



did not PARDON us; that is, He did not suffer our sins "to pass 
without punishment," but "Laid upon Him (Jesus) the iniquity of us 
all. " (Isa. 53:6.)Then God did not (pardon), remit the penalty; for 
"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures. " (1 Cor. 15:3.) 

The general difficulty seems to be, that people use the words, 
forgive and pardon, as though they were the same, whereas they are 
not so: Webster's primary definition of FORGIVE is—to give away, 
to make over, to resign, "to cease to feel resentment against," or, "to 
cease to impute" —to remit. Webster also gives, as a secondary 
meaning of forgiveness, the generally accepted sense— pardon. But 
note the difference in the primary meaning of the words: Pardon 
"refrains from exacting a penalty" while forgiveness signifies much 
less, viz. , that a claim is made over to some one else. Thus Jehovah 
sold or "made over" or resigned to Jesus, the claims of Justice on 
mankind; and thus Jesus bought us with his own precious blood. 
Thus we see, too, that when "we were reconciled to God by the 
death of his Son," it was because he forgave us, i. e. , "ceased to 
feel resentment against" us (Web. def.) because our ransom price 
had been paid as provided by himself, who so loved us that he gave 
His son to redeem us. Thus, too, "God was in Christ 
RECONCILING the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses 
unto them. " The sins had been imputed to mankind, until Jesus 
died, then God FORGAVE i. e. , "ceased to impute," (Webster's 
def.) to us, what had been paid by our RANSOM. 

Now mark clearly that God did not PARDON, i. e. , "refrain from 
exacting the penalty," but "Laid upon Him (Jesus) the iniquity of us 
all. " He bore our sins (penalty) in his own body on the tree. (1 Pet. 
2:24.) And now we see how God forgave us freely for CHRIST'S 
SAKE, i. e. , because He paid the penalty which was the full 
satisfaction of Justice. 

Not that God desired to destroy men and Jesus appeased his wrath; 
no, God's love for the world was the cause of the redemption or 
purchase. "God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten 
Son" to purchase -redeem them. Yes, the whole plan is of God. 
(Rom. 11:36.) 

But it should not be supposed, that God compelled the just one to 
die for the unjust. No, Justice could not inflict punishment upon one 
for another's sin. The Scriptures declare -He laid down his life, of 
himself; not for fear of Divine wrath; not because compelled; but 
for the joy that was set before him, (the Father's promises of high 
exaltation to glory, honor, and immortality: and for the joy of 
redeeming and restoring mankind and of bringing many sons to 
glory) HE ENDURED THE CROSS. Heb. 12:2. 

Now notice, the Greek words— Apoluo, Aphiemi, and Aphesis, 
translated -forgiveness, forgiven, and forgive, in the New 
Testament, have the same significance as the corresponding English 
words: or as given by Young- "To let go," or "to send away. "Mark 
well, it does not mean as some seem to infer— to send away without 



an equivalent. It does not mean that God will let go the sinner 
unconditionally. But God will let go the prisoners out of death, 
because he has found a RANSOM. (Job 33:24.) 

Yes, Jesus gave himself a RANSOM (an equivalent price) for all: 
(1 Tim. 2:6.) Therefore, "all that are in their graves (prisoners in the 
pit) shall hear his voice and come forth. 

Though the word pardon does not occur in the New Testament, a 
Greek word of nearly the same meaning does occur, viz: 
Karazomai- It signifies, to forgive freely. We will give some 
illustrations of the use of this word, from which you will see that it 
does not oppose but confirms our statements, that our Father does 
not pardon, or unconditionally set sinners free, from sin's penalty. 
(The words forgive and forgave as translated from this word 
Karazomai occur in all, only twelve times.) 

"Forgiving one another. . . even as Christ forgave you. " (Col. 
3:13.) "When they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both. 
""He to whom he forgave most. " (Luke 7:42, 43.) Here are four 
instances in which it is FREE forgiveness, or PARDON. But notice 
it is not Jehovah, but Christ and the disciples who do the free 
forgiving. Jesus was in the very act of paying the ransom price of 
both Simon, Mary, and others, and realizing that Justice would be 
satisfied by his act, he, as the purchaser, could freely forgive them. 

We wish that all our readers might hereafter be able to appreciate 
the difference between pardoned and forgiveness, or reconciliation 
toward us as based on our "redemption through his (Jesus') blood. " 
(Col. 1:14.) All will admit that God is JUST; and if so, he did not 
inflict too severe a sin penalty on man when he deprived him of 
life. Now, if that penalty was just, 6000 years ago, it is still a just 
penalty, and will be just for all coming time. If the penalty was too 
severe, and God pardons the sinner from further continuance of the 
penalty, it proves that God was then, or is now UNJUST. If it was 
right 6000 years ago to deprive mankind of life because of sin, it 
would be always wrong to restore the life, unless the sin were paid 
for-canceled. This could only be accomplished by another being of 
the same kind, whose right to life was unforfeited, giving himself as 
a substitute or ransom. 

It is written: "There is none righteous -no, not ONE. "Therefore 
none, in the sight of justice, have a right to life; and God could not 
justly give pardon and life to those whom his own Justice had 
already condemned; to do so, would be to make Mercy and Love 
over-ride Justice, and such a warfare is not supposable in God's 
attributes. No, if the Love and Mercy of God would benefit men, it 
must be done in harmony with Justice. And it was; LOVE provided 
the ransom (1 John 4:10.)And MERCY uses the same ONE [Christ, 
head and body] as its agent in blessing the world of men. 

"Forever firm Thy JUSTICE stands, 
As mountains their foundations keep. " 



This very principle of JUSTICE which underlies all of our Father's 
doings is the ground of our strong confidence in all his promises. 

Our Father declares that He is the same yesterday, to-day, and 
forever; with Him is no variableness at all, neither shadow of 
turning. (Jam. 1:17.) If He were so changeable as to condemn to a 
penalty in Adam's day, and 6000 years after to revoke and annul 
His own decision, what security could we have that in 6000 years, 
more or less, He might not change again, and remand us to the 
prison-house of death by REVOKING THE PARDON of some or 
of all. And we have no foundation for hope, except in the fact that 
Christ died for us.

PREFACE 



THIS pamphlet is prepared for thinking Christians especially those, 
who "by reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both 
good and evil." (Heb. 5: 11-14) 

The author has sought to present not so much the details of the 
Tabernacle structure and its furniture, as an explanation of the 
teachings, and of the significance of the typical sacrifices. The 
former have-been frequently described at length by other writers. 
In the interpretation of the types we accept as correct, only such 
interpretation, as is found in harmony with other features of the 
same type, and with the plan and Word of God in general. When 
we find this, and we believe it to be the case in those explanations 
offered in this little work, then we feel sure that we have the truth 
on the subject. 

As many of the thoughts are new, the readers will generally be 
more benefited by a second or third reading than by the first. 



This pamphlet is dedicated to the Priests and Levites of the Gospel 
Age-The body of Christ, and Household of Faith-praying the God 
of all grace that it may be blest to such as have an "ear to hear."

THE TABERNACLE 

CHAPTER 1. 

A DESCRIPTION OF ITS FURNITURE 
ITS APARTMENTS-ITS PEOPLE. 



The Tabernacle which god commanded Israel to construct in 
the Wilderness, and in connection with which, all their religious 
services and ceremonies were instituted, is, as Paul assures us, a 
shadow of good things to come. (Heb. 8: 5; 10:1; Col. 2:17). In fact 
the whole nation of Israel, with their laws and their religious 
services and ceremonies, was typical of the spiritual Israel, with 
their higher privileges, developed during the Gospel Age. 

This being true, our understanding of the plan and work of 
salvation now in progress, as will as its future developments, 
cannot fail to be greatly increased and cleared by a careful study of 
that Jewish shadow, which they repeated year by year continually 
for our edification, who live in this Gospel Age. (1 Pet. 1:12) 

It is not simply to gain a historical knowledge of the Jewish 
forms, ceremonies, and worship, that we come to the investigation 
of this subject, but that we may be edified by understanding the 
substance from an examination of the shadow, as god designed in 
arranging it. 

We would fail to attach sufficient weight and importance to the 
shadow, unless we realize how carefully God guided and directed 
all of its details: First, taking Moses up into the mount and giving 
him an illustration of just how things were to be made; Secondly, 
charging him to be very careful-"See, saith He, that thou make all 
things after the pattern showed thee in the mount." (Heb. 8:5, Ex. 
25:40). So too, with all the minutia of the service; every jot and 
tittle must be performed in the type, because it illustrated 
something great and grand coming after. And in order that these 
shadows might all be exactly performed, and that the people might 
not become careless, the usual penalty for any violation was death: 



For instance-2 Sam. 6:6, 7; Lev. 10:2; Ex. 28:43; Num. 4:15, 20: 
17: 13. 

Realizing God's care in making the "shadow,'" should not only 
give us confidence in its correctness-that not one jot or tittle of it 
shall fail until all shall be fulfilled (Matt. 5:18)-But, it should also 
awaken in us so great an interest in god's plan, as would lead us to 
examine closely, and search carefully, for the meaning of those 
shadows: And this, with God's promised blessing we now propose 
to do, assured that among those who are truly God's consecrated 
ones-children begotten of the Spirit-"He that seeketh; and to him 
that knocketh, it shall be opened." 

The Tabernacle represented spiritual (heavenly) conditions; the 
furthest-Most Holy-representing the perfect spiritual condition in 
which Jehovah's glory is seen. The glory within testified to the 
majesty of his presence, while the cloud without was a continual 
reminder of their separation from him. 

The directions given to Moses for its construction may be 
found in Ex. 25 to 27, and the account of the performance of the 
work in Ex. 35 to 40. Briefly stated, the Tabernacle was 
constructed of a series of boards, "overlaid" or plated with gold 
and set on end into sockets of silver, and firmly fastened together 
by bars of the same wood (Shittim) also covered with gold. 

This structure was 15 feet wide, 15 feet high, and 45 feet long 
(Shittim) also covered with gold. It was covered by a large linen 
cloth, with figures of cherubic woven into it, in blue, purple and 
scarlet colors. The open end, or front of the structure was closed by 
a curtain of similar material to the covering cloth-called the door, 
or first vail. Another cloth of the same materials and colors, and 
similarly woven with figures of cherubs, call "the Vail" (or second 
vail) was hung under the taches, thus dividing he Tabernacle into 
two apartments. The first or larger apartment (15 feet wide and 30 
feet long) was called "The Holy."* 

The second apartment (15 feet wide and 15 feet long) was 
called "The Most Holy." Over this Tabernacle proper, was a tent to 
shelter it and protect it from the weather. It was made of a covering 
of goat's hair, another of ram skins dyed red, and another of badger 
skins-seal skins. 

The Tabernacle was surrounded by a yard or "court" toward the 
rear of which, it stood. This court 75 feet wide and 150 feet long 
was formed by linen curtains suspended from silver hooks, set in 
the tops of wooden posts 7-1/2 feet high, which were set in heavy 
sockets of brass (copper) and braced like the test with cords and 
pins. This enclosure was all holy ground, and was therefore called 
the "holy place"-also the "court of the Tabernacle." Its opening, 
like the door of the Tabernacle, was toward the east, and was called 



"the gate." It also was of linen embroidered with blue, purple and 
scarlet. It will be noticed that the three entrance passages, viz.: "the 
gate" to the court or "holy place"-"the door" to the "holy" and 
"the vail" to the "Most Holy" were of the same material and colors. 
*Frequently this in our translation is improperly called the "holy 
place;" and in such instances the word place will be found in 
italics, indicating that it has been supplied by the translators, as for 
instance in Ex. 26:33. This error is quite confusing as "the court" 
was properly called "the holy place." When place is not in italics, 
"the court" is always means. See Lev. 14:13 and 6:27. In some 
instances "The Holy is termed "The Tabernacle of the 
congregation" and called "the Holy place" (place in italics.) 
Instances, Lev. 16:17, 20, 33. In our description we will call those 
apartments severally, "The Camp," The Court," "The Holy" and 
"Most Holy." 

THE FURNITURE OF THE COURT 

consisted of but two pieces: the "Brazen Altar" and the "Laver." 

THE BRAZEN ALTAR 

First on entering the gate and immediately in front of it stood 
the Brazen Altar. This altar was made of woodland covered with 
copper, it was 7-1/2 feet square, 4-1/2 feet high. It had various 
utensils belonging to its service-fire plans, called censers, for 
carrying the fire to the Incense Altar; basins to receive the blood; 
flesh-hooks, shovels, etc. 

THE LAVER 

Next, between the Brazen Altar and the door of the Tabernacle, 
was the Laver. It was made of polished copper which served as a 
mirror, and was a receptacle for water for the washing of the priests 
before entering the Tabernacle. 

THE FURNITURE OF THE TABERNACLE 

consisted of a Table, a Candlestick and a Incense Altar in the holly, 
and the Ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy. 

THE TABLE OF SHEW BREAD 

Within the Tabernacle on the right (north) stood a wooden 
table overlaid with gold, and upon it were placed twelve cakes of 
unleavened bread in two rows or piles with frankincense on top of 
each pile. (Lev. 24:6) The bread was for the priests; it was holy, 
and was renewed every Sabbath day. 



THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK 

Opposite this table was the "candlestick" made of pure gold 
beaten work (hammered out) having seven branches and in each 
branch a lamp. It was the only light in "the holy," for as we have 
seen, the natural light was obscured by the walls and curtains- 
there were no windows. 

THE "GOLDEN INCENSE ALTAR" 

Further on, close up the "the Vail" stood a small altar of wood, 
covered with gold, called the "Golden Altar" or "Incense Altar." It 
had no fire upon it except as the priests brought it in the censers 
which they set in the top of this golden altar, and then crumbled the 
incense upon it, giving forth fragrant perfume. 

THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY 

Beyond the vail, in the Most Holy, there was but one piece of 
furniture-the Ark. It was a rectangular box made of wood overlaid 
with gold, having a lid called the "Mercy Seat," which was of pure 
gold. Upon it (and of the same piece) were two cherubs of gold- 
beaten work. Within this ark (under the mercy seat) were placed 
the golden bowl of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the 
two tables of the law. (Heb. 9:4) Upon the mercy seat, a 
supernatural light appeared shining out between the cherubim: This 
was the only light in the Most Holy. 

It is noticeable that everything inside the Tabernacle was of 
gold, while in the court everything was of copper. Wood, which 
was used as the basis, and was covered by these metals was used, 
we believe, simply to make the articles lighter of weight, than if of 
solid metal. This would be an important consideration where they 
traveled continually. (The vessels of the Temple were of solid 
metals. 1 Kings 7:23, 48) These two metals, gold and copper, were 
used, we think, to represent two different natures-copper 
representing the human nature (in its perfection); and gold 
representing the divine nature-much alike in their appearance, yet 
different in quality, as the human is an image of the Diving Being. 

It will be noticed that the arrangement of the structure formed 
three general parts-the 

CAMP, COURT AND TABERNACLE 

The Camp represented the condition of the world of mankind in 
sin, typified by all Israel. These were separated from all holy things 
by the curtains of white linen, which to those within represent a 
wall of unbelief which hinders their view of, and access to holy 
things within. The only view of, and access to holy things within. 
The only way to enter "the court" or "holy place" is to come 



through the gate-"I am the way... no man cometh unto the Father 
but by me." John 14:6. 

The Court represented the condition of justification entered by 
faith in Christ, the "gate." Into this court, only Levites (type of 
believers) were allowed to come. These have access to the brazen 
altar and laver, and do service in the court, but have no right as 
Levites (believers) to go into the Tabernacle; no, nor even to look 
into it. (Num. 4:19,20) Here all things are of copper representing 
the perfect human condition. 

The Tabernacle represented the condition of all who have 
changed their nature; that is, those who have consecrated their 
human nature to death, and have become partakers of the Divine 
nature by being begotten of the Spirit. And no human being, be he 
ever so full of faith, be he washed from every sin and in God's 
sight justified freely from all things-reckoned perfect, can have 
any place or privilege in Divine things; not even to look into them. 
("The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit... neither 
can he know them because they are spiritual discerned.)" 1 Cor. 
2:14 

All things in the Tabernacle are of gold representing the Divine 
nature. Only those of the Levites who were consecrated to the work 
of sacrifice (the Priests) had access to the Tabernacle. So only 
those of the household of faith, who are consecrated to sacrifice, 
enter the Divine condition represented by the Tabernacle. 

The court or justified human condition was entered by faith 
only; but while we must retain the faith that justifies, we must do 
more, if we would change our nature and become "new creatures"- 
-partakers of the Divine nature. If we would enter the Tabernacle or 
Divine condition, we must crucify the justified flesh, presenting 
our human wills and bodies a living sacrifice to God; no longer to 
seek for human pleasure, honors, praise, etc., but to be dead to 
these and alive to the heavenly ones. Yet we come into this 
condition also, through Christ Jesus our Lord. 

The two apartments of the Tabernacle, the Holy and the Most 
Holy, represented two phases of the Divine life. The Holy 
represented the present condition of those begotten of God through 
the Word. (Divine minded, "new creatures," dwelling this side of 
"the vail"-in the flesh.) The Most Holy represented our perfected 
condition as new creatures. When born from the dead in the 
resurrection. Then being beyond the vail-the flesh, we shall have 
our glorious spiritual bodies, as well as our spiritual minds. We 
shall be like our Leader, our forerunner beyond the vail, who, 
having entered, hath consecrated for us this new and living way (to 
the new life) beyond the vail, that is to say his flesh. The spiritual 
minded creature in the Holy, by faith looks forward through the 



rent vail into the Most Holy catching glimpses of the glory, honor 
and immortality beyond the vail. (Heb. 6:19; and 10:20) 

We see, then, that justification by faith, brings us into a 
condition of peace with God. Our sins being forgiven, we are a step 
nearer to God, but still human- -in the court. If we would attain to 
the prize of our high calling which is of God in Christ Jesus, 
entering in through the Holy to the Most Holy, we must follow in 

THE FOOTSTEPS OF JESUS 

our Leader and Head-the High Priest of our profession. By faith in 
his ransom we have entered the gate to the court-the vail of 
unbelief is passed. By renouncing our human will and all our 
human aspirations and hopes, we pass the second vail, or vail of 
human mindedness, counting our human will as dead; henceforth 
not consulting it, but the will of God only. 

We now find ourselves as "new creatures" in The Holy-in the 
first of the "the Heavenlies" or Holies (Eph. 2:6) E. Diaglott); and 
here we are enlightened by the Golden Candlestick, (God's Word) 
refreshed and strengthened daily with the truth as bread (lawful 
only for the Priests to eat). And thus enlightened and strengthened, 
we are daily offering up spiritual sacrifice at the Golden Altar, 
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ-a sweet perfume to our Father. 

Thus, all such are in a heavenly or holy condition now-seated 
at rest and communion) with Christ in the first of those heavenly 
places" seated at rest and communion) with Christ in the first of 
those heavenly places" but not yet in the Holiest of all. No, another 
vail must first be passed: As the passing of the proceeding vail was 
the death of the human will, so the passing of the second vail is the 
death of the human body; and it requires both to complete our 
sacrifice: Both fleshly mind and fleshly body must first be passed 
before we shall be in the "Holiest of all"-made perfect-born into 
the Divine condition. 

With these thoughts as to the three conditions represented by 
these three places-Camp, Court and Tabernacle, let us notice 
particularly the three classes occupying these conditions- viz., the 
World, Believers and Consecrated Believers; typified respectively 
by 

ISRAELITES, LEVITES AND THE PRIESTHOOD 

In understanding the significance of the Tabernacle service, it 
is necessary, not only to get a clear idea of the structure, its 
furniture, and their typical signification, but also of the actors and 
their significance, as types. 

Israel is used in many instances to typify the Gospel Church. 
For instance: When they left Egyptian bondage, they were a type of 



God's children who hear his call to come out from the world and 
engage in his worship. 

The wilderness journey represents the tedious pilgrimage 
through which many pass, seeking the promised Canaan-"Come 
unto me and I will give you rest." 

As in the type, so in reality, the promised Canaan of rest is not 
afar off, if they had faith enough to go up and take it. God has 
made abundant provision for them. Yet they journey through the 
wilderness of sin seeking rest, but finding none, because they lack 
faith in God's promises. Some wander thus a long time; some 
never enter the Canaan rest because of unbelief. 

But while Israel according to the flesh, is thus an in many other 
ways used to typify the spiritual Israel; yet, it is a totally different 
type, as we are now examining it, in its relations to the Tabernacle. 

Here, Israel unquestionably typifies the whole world of 
mankind. The sin offering sacrifices, atonement, etc. Made 
typically for them (and them only) were typical of better sacrifices 
and atonement, made o n behalf of the whole world: "For He is a 
propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins 
of the whole world." (1 John 2:2) 

In a word, Israel was a type, as well as the Tabernacle, Priests, 
Levites, and Sacrifices. And that which was there done in pictures, 
is, since the first coming of Christ, being carried out on a higher 
plane and on a larger scale. The latter the reality, of which that was 
the type or shadow. 

As Israel typified the world, so the tribe of Levites, we believe, 
typified the "Household of faith," or all believers in Jesus and his 
ransom. 

The Priesthood-one body under one chief of High Priest-was 
typical of the "little flock" who are to be-with their "Head" or 
"High Priest- Kings and Priests, to reign on the earth. (Rev. 5:10) 

But before these members of the body of Christ shall be united 
to their Head and begin their reign, they must first "suffer with 
Him" in making the sacrifices, as we will shortly see. (2 Tim. 2:12) 

Peter tells us who were typified by the priests, when addressing 
those who are sanctified, he says: (1 Peter 1:2 and 2:5,9) "Ye are 
...an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to 
God by Jesus Christ. "Ye are.. .a royal priesthood." 

That the head or chief of this priesthood-"little flock"-is 
Jesus, is repeatedly mentioned by the apostles. We give but one 
quotation: "Holy brethren (the Royal Priesthood) partakers of the 
Heavenly calling, consider the apostle and High Priest of our 
profession, Christ Jesus. (Heb. 3:1) 

As we now pass to the consideration of the inauguration of the 
typical priesthood, we notice that the tribe of Levites (typical of 



believers, or those on the justified plane) existed for a long time 
before the priesthood was instituted. So in the antitype, the royal 
priesthood began with the anointing of Jesus (at baptism, Luke 
3:22, Acts 10:38) but believers, justified by faith in Christ, had 
lived long before that. For instance-Abraham who believed God 
and was justified by his faith. (Rom. 4:2,3 ) Though even the type 
had not yet come in his day, yet Abraham as a justified believer 
was a member of the "household of faith," typified by the Levites- 
though not of the "royal priesthood." 

CHAPTER n 
ANOINTING THE PRIESTHOOD 



In this ceremony as in every other, relating to the ordination 
and work of the priesthood, it will be well to notice that Jesus was 
the first-the leader, Captain, Forerunner-teaching clearly that 
none preceded him, hence that none of the Patriarchs or Prophets 
are of the "little flock"-"the royal priesthood"-the Bride, the 
Lamb's wife." Though they will be greatly blessed as the Lord's 
ministers-Levites, it will not be so grandly high as the position of 
priests. "The narrow way to life "(Immortality) was not opened up 
until Jesus came. He was the first to walk on it. He "brought life 
and immortality to light." (2 Tim. 1:10) And though all believers 
(Levites) shall become possessors of everlasting life, [and the 
world (Israel) also, if they will accept it-during the Millennial age] 
yet, only the priesthood, who overcome and follow their Leader in 
the narrow way to life- sacrificing the human-thus seeking glory, 
Honor and Immortality, will ever become the possessors of that 
unlimited degree of life called Immortality, as yet possessed only 
by Jehovah and our Lord Jesus. (See "Food for Thinking 
Christians," page 134, or "Zion's Watch Tower," Sept. 1881, page 
7-"The narrow way to life.") 

Under the Law the anointing was the ceremony by which the 
Priests were installed in God's service. The Priests were anointed 
to their office with a peculiar ointment, called the holy anointing 
oil, used upon none but the Priests, and unlawful for any one else 
to have or to make under penalty of death. Ex. 30:25-33 This oil 
typified the Holy Spirit of adoption whereby we are sealed. Only 
the consecrated ones are ever to be anointed thus. Aaron, the 
typical High Priest, represented Jesus the head, and the church as 
members of the body of the great High Priest. Being but a sinful 
man he had to be washed in order to fitly represent the purity of the 
antitype. Aaron was then clothed with the holy garments of "glory 
and of beauty," (Ex. 28) and then the anointing oil was poured on 



his head. Each article of the glorious apparel was typical of 
qualities and powers of the Great Deliverer-head and body, which 
Jehovah discerned looking down to "the magnification of the Sons 
of God," and the fulfillment in them of his promises. 

THE HIGH PRIEST IN GARMENTS 
OF "GLORY AND BEAUTY" 

And these are the garments ...a breastplate, and an ephod, and 
an upper robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre and a girdle. (Ex. 28: 
4) 

The linen coat represents the High Priest's purity, while its 
embroidery showed the outgrowth of that character in works. The 
mitre, a strip of fine linen, worn around the forehead, to which was 
fastened with a blue lacer, the golden plate or crown, shows that 
the crown is righteously his. Upon the golden plate was inscribed, 
"Holiness to the Lord," thus proclaiming: This great High Priest is 
entirely devoted to the accomplishment of Jehovah's purposes. The 
golden crown proclaims his royalty: He is to be "a priest upon his 
throne"-a priest forever (for the age) after the order of 
Melchizedek. (Psa. 110:4) The linen girdle indicates a righteous 
servant; linen-righteousness; girdle- servitude. 

The upper robe, made of blue represents his faithfulness. The 
fringe of it was made of golden bells and pomegranates. The 
pomegranate, being a choice fruit, showed that his faithfulness 
bore fruit; the gold bells, that God witnessed to his faithfulness. 

The ephod was made of a cloth of purple, blue, scarlet, white 
and gold threads; interwoven skillfully and beautifully. It was of 
two parts, one hanging in front and the other over the back. These 
two parts were fastened together by two gold clasps which rested 
on the shoulders. This ephod, we believe, typified two covenants: 
the Abrahamic represented by the front part, and the New 
Covenant represented by the back part, both of which are thus 
shown to be dependent on this High Priest. 

They are laid on him; if he fails to support them, they must fall 
to the ground. But thank god, they are firmly clasped on him by the 
Gold clasps, (Divine power) as well as bound to him by the 
"Curious girdle"-a cord made of the same materials as the ephod. 
This girdle seems to say, this is a servant; and as this is the girdle 
of the ephod it tells us that this one is-The messenger (servant) of 
the Covenant whom ye delight in." (Mai 3:1) 

The Abrahamic Covenant truly, is partly fulfilled in the person 
of the High Priest- who is the Seed, the spiritual seed, which is to 
bless all. But we have seen that the Abrahamic covenant has two 
phases: the Heavenly, spiritual seed, and the fleshly seed, the literal 
descendants of Abraham; the latter the only one recognized by 



Abraham, the spiritual being hid in the natural. During the Gospel 
Age the spiritual seed develops and becomes members of the body 
of the High Priest growing up into the head. But after this spiritual 
seed has been developed, that phase of the covenant, understood by 
Abraham and all his descendants to this day, will be fulfilled. So 
say Paul: "As concerning the Gospel (the spiritual part of the 
covenant) they are enemies for your sakes; but as touching the 
election they are (still) beloved for the father's sake. For the gifts 
and callings of God are not things he will repent of. For this is my 
covenant to them. There shall come out of Zion (the spiritual 
church) the delivered, [this great High Priest,* the servant of the 
covenant-- Jesus the head and the "little flock" his body] and shall 
turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Rom. 11:26-29 

So then, after the body of Christ, the spiritual seed is complete, 
the Abrahamic covenant must have a fulfillment to the fleshly 
seed; that fleshly seed must become great "as the sand by the 
seashore" as the heavenly seed is likened to the "the stars of 
heaven." They must first be turned to righteousness and truth, and 
then become an agency through which the spiritual seed will 
operate to bless all mankind with truth and knowledge. 

Thus the earthly phase of the Abrahamic covenant is seen still 
to depend on and to be upheld by the Great High Priest, who is also 
the mediator of the "New Covenant which God promises to make 
when the Day of Atonement is ended and he has taken away their 
sins. (Jer. 31:31, Ezk. 11:19 and 36:24), Rom. 11:27) This new 
covenant is typified by the back part of the ephod. 

The scarlet, blue purple, etc., which composed the ephod, 
indicated the conditions of the covenant; the scarlet shows how 
god provides redemption from the Adamic curse through the blood 
of the ransom; the white linen indicated the restoration of man to 
his original purity; the blue vouchsafes to him the ability to 
faithfully maintain his righteous character; the purple proclaims the 
restoration of the royalty of earth as possessed by Adam, earth's 
first monarch. All of these blessings are woven together-made 
sure, by the Divine power of the anointed Priest, as shown by the 
interwoven golden thread. That part of the Abrahamic covenant 
referring to the spiritual seed, is represented as complete in God's 
sight. They all as Good sees them, are born of the spirit to t he 
completeness of the Divine nature, represented by the gold, and in 
the person of the Priest. 

Thus Jehovah has laid all these covenants upon one who is 
both mighty and willing to execute these glorious covenanted 
blessings-"in due time." 

The Breastplate of Judgment was placed on the front of the 
ephod. 



It was suspended by a gold chain from the clasps on the 
shoulders, and was fastened to the ephod by a lacer, through golden 
rings-this fastening being so concealed underneath, that to the 
casual observer it might appear to be a part of the ephod. (Exo. 
28:26-28) This breastplate represents beautifully the Law. It was 
not a part of the Abrahamic covenant but "It was added" to it. (Gal. 
3:19) As the Israelite regarded them, not seeing the hidden 
connection, the covenant to Abraham and "the law which was 430 
years after," were all one: but Paul shows us that there are two 
parts-two seeds-to this covenant: the spiritual, and the natural. 
The covenant and the Law were distinct "to the end that the 
promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of 
the Law, but to that also which is of the faith. " Rom. 4: 16 

This Law emblem (the breastplate) was one of the most 
beautiful of the High Priest's garments; it was made of the same 
materials as the ephod. It had in it, set in gold, twelve precious 
jewels, in which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes. It 
was bound on his heart, indicating that it was his delight to keep it. 
As a "breastplate" of righteousness" it was covered him. That 
which condemned all imperfect ones was his pleasure-"I delight to 
do thy will O my god; yea, thy law is within my heart." (Psa. 40:8) 

The breastplate was two spans long and one wide, folded in the 
middle, i.e., a span long and a span wide double. The size, a span, 
indicates that the Law of God is the full measure of a perfect man's 
ability-- Jesus, being perfect, was the only one who ever kept it 
literally, while his body has his righteousness imputed. 

Its being double of the same size and measure represents the 
letter and the spirit of the law. The front part contained the jewels 
and was hung by the gold chain to the gold clasps of the ephod; the 
under part was fastened to the ephod. This latter, tied to the ephod 
(covenant) seems to represent the law in letter as presented to 
fleshly Israel. The former, or front part seems to illustrate the spirit 
of the law as kept by the true Israel-or overcomers-- ,, the 
righteousness of the law fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh 
but after the spirit." (Rom. 8:4) The law of love. Pure gold being a 
symbol of divine things, the dependence of this part of the Law by 
a gold chain, from the gold clasps, seems to teach that the Law is 
kept by divine power; and so we know, it is by divine strength that 
we walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. It is this phase of 
the Law which bears the "jewels" set in gold representative of the 
true Israel. "They shall be mine in the day that I come to make up 
my jewels." Thus embedded in gold (the divine nature) and upheld 
by the golden chain of divine promises, what wonder that "the 
righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us." 



The equality of size, of the two parts of the breastplate seems to 
illustrate what we have seen to be frequently taught elsewhere in 
Scripture, viz.: that the Jewish and Gospel ages are of equal size 
and measure; the Jewish a type or picture of this age. 

As Aaron stood there clothed in these typically glorious and 
beautiful robes and anointed with the holy oil, his head 
representing Jesus-the head of the priesthood, and his body 
representing the church complete in him, how impressive his 
significance, as a type of the World's High Priest, undefiled, and 
clothed with power and authority to carry out Jehovah's covenants. 
We see the body again typified individually by the under priests 
who wore bonnets covering their own heads to indicate that they 
were not the head of the Priesthood, but members of his body. God 
gave Jesus "to be the head over all things to the church which is 
his body." (Eph. 1:22,23) 

It is for this reason that Paul insists that a woman's head should 
be covered as indicating that she is not the head; the husband and 
wife being typical of Jesus and his Bride-the church of the first- 
born. These under priests were robed in linen garments, the 
imputed righteousness of Jesus, and girdled, showing that they 
were servants under their head. 

As Aaron had the holy oil poured upon his head, so our head, 
Jesus was anointed with the antitypical oil-the Holy Spirit-when 
he was thirty years of age, on the banks of Jordan, at the time of 
this consecration. There He was "anointed with the oil of gladness 
above his fellows"-as head over all the joint heirs. A measure of 
the Spirit is given to every man who thus consecrates; but Jehovah 
gave "not the Spirit by measure unto Him." (John 3:34) John saw 
and bore record that our High Priest was thus anointed (John 1:32; 
Luke 4:1), and Peter adds his testimony (Acts 10:38) "How God 
anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power." 

The anointing oil was poured only upon the head. The under 
priests were not anointed individually. Since they were recognized 
as members of the High Priest' s body, they received their anointing 
through the head. 

The oil "ran down even unto the skirts of his garments" (Psa 
133:2) thus representing how the members of his body, are all to be 
partakers of the same anointing after their head. "T anointing 
which ye have received of him abideth in you." 1 John 2:27) This 
oil began to reach the body on the day of Pentecost and flows on 
down through this Gospel Age, anointing all who are truly baptized 
into Christ, to be with their head, Kings and Priests unto God; to 
reign a thousand years. (Rev. 20:6) 

We thus see that Aaron robed and anointed represented the 
entire Christ (anointed one)-"The seed" in which God is about to 



bless all the families of the earth. But let us not forget that we have 
been viewing the Great Deliverer from God's standpoint, and with 
Him looking down to the time of his manifestation-the dawn of 
the Millennial day— when all the members have come into the body 
and when the "holy oil" has run down "even to the skirts of his 
garments" anointing every member. Then he will begin the work of 
blessing mankind. For the glorious reign of this Kingly Priest, we 
constantly pray-'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth." 

CHAPTER IK. 
CONSECRATING THE PRIESTHOOD 



Lev. 8:14, 33 

This requirement of the Law was typical of the entire 
consecration of the human nature of Jesus and his body, to the will 
of Jehovah-his obedience even unto death; and the obedience of 
the members of his body suffering the same with him. All the body 
represented by Aaron's sons, as well as the Head, represented by 
Aaron, are by the sacrifices now being made, consecrated for their 
future work as kings and priests, to restore and rule and bless 
mankind. When this consecration is made, they have given ALL 
they had. But their extremity is Jehovah's opportunity, and when 
they have consecrated all they had to destruction, they are begotten 
of God to a new nature-the spiritual; and not only so, but to the 
highest order of the spiritual-the Divine nature; and as such they 
are owned as sons of God. (Gal 4: 4,7 and 2 Pet. 1:4) 

The type now shows these two natures: the higher is 
represented by Aaron and his sons, while the human is represented 
by a bullock. The bullock for the sin offering was brought "and 
Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of it, thus 
saying, this sacrifice represents our human nature. From that 
moment, all that happened to the bullock, represents what was to 
be done to Jesus and his body-the church-as human beings. The 
bullock is delivered up to "the Law" -(represented by Moses) to 
meet its demands. To thus meet the demands of the law, it must be 
slain-" And Moses slew it." Then he applies the blood to the horns 
of the altar. The "finger'" of the "Law" thus pointed out that the 
altar of earthly sacrifices was acceptable to God by reason of the 
shed blood (the life given), and that all who realize the power of 
the altar (Horns are symbols of power) must recognize first the 
blood which sanctified it. The blood poured at the bottom of the 
altar, shows that through the blood of the sacrifice (life given) even 
the earth was purchased back from the curse which sin brought 



upon it. See Eph. 114: "Unto the redemption of the purchased 
possession.") 

And Moses took the bullock, his hide, flesh, etc. And burned 
them with fire without the camp. (Vs. 17) Thus the humanity of 
the Christ complete-head and body-is made a sin offering, 
suffering the destruction to which the world was doomed, and from 
which, through the sacrifice, they shall ultimately be delivered. But 
while the human existence is destroyed, as represented by the 
burning of the bullock without the camp, God accepts the loving 
zeal which says, Lo, I come to do thy will O God." "I delight to do 
thy will O my God"-as represented by the offering on the altar, of 
the fat and parts of the inward life-producing organism, as a sweet 
savor unto the Lord. 

Other features of the same consecration are shown by the two 
rams mentioned in verses 18 and 22. The first mentioned is the ram 
for burn offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon its 
head, thus indicating that it represented them. It was killed; its 
blood sprinkled the altar; and Moses "cut the ram into pieces and 
wash the inwards and legs in water" and "burnt the head and 
pieces, and the fat.," Thus Jesus and his body, the church are being 
presented before God on the altar, during the entire Gospel Age. 
The head was laid there first, and since, all who are "dead with 
him," cleansed, as in the type, by the washing of water through the 
word. Its burning on the altar shows how God accepts this "as a 
sweet smelling savor." 

The second ram, "the ram of consecration," shows what effect 
the sacrifice will have upon us, as the first showed how God 
received it. Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon its head-it 
represented them. And Moses slew it and took its blood- 
(consecrated life and put it upon each separately -(Consecration is 
an individual work). And he put it upon the tip of the right ear, 
thumb of right hand and great toe of the right foot. Thus, by our 
consecration, we are enabled to have the "hearing of faith" and to 
appreciate God's promises as none but the consecrated can. Our 
hands are consecrated, so that whatsoever our hands find to do, we 
do it with our might as unto the Lord. Our feet are consecrated so 
that henceforth we "walk not as other Gentiles," but "walk in 
newness of life," walk by faith," "walk in the spirit," "walk in the 
light," and even "as ye received Christ, so walk in him." 

The choice portions of the ram, inwards and fat, representing 
our best powers, were taken in t heir hands, and waved, passed to 
and fro, before the Lord representing the fact that a consecrated 
offering is not given the Lord for the moment, or day, or year, but 
continually we keep our affections and powers uplifted before our 



Father, never ceasing until accepted of him as having finished our 
course. And Moses took them off their hands, God's acceptance 
shown by fire. When the love (fat) of our inmost being is laid upon 
the altar, it helps to increase the fire of God's acceptance. The 
more love there is connected with our consecration to God, the 
more quickly will it be accepted by Him as entire consecration. 

Upon this wave offering, while in their hands, were laid three 
cakes from a basketful. This offering was laid by Moses upon the 
hands of both high and under priests. 

The first unleavened cake, represented the actual purity of 
Jesus as a man, and the imputed purity of the church as men, as 
attested by the Law (Moses). The second unleavened cake mingled 
with oil, represented the indwelling spirit of God-Sanctification. 
The third wafer, mingled with honey represented our faith in the 
exceeding great and precious promises of Glory, Honor and 
Immortality. Honey, a type of the bliss of paradise, was never 
allowed to be burned in sacrifice; so it is earthly bless and pleasure 
only which we consecrate. 

Without these three elements, it is impossible for our 
consecration to be acceptable, viz: Justification (purity) 
Sanctification by the Spirit through the belief of the truth and faith 
in the promised Glorification. 

This consecration is in progress during the entire gospel Age; 
even when as individuals our offering has been waved and 
accepted, we are to abide in the Tabernacle, eating of the cakes, 
growing in grace and knowledge continually, by partaking of the 
assurances and promises of God's Word- for we shall live by the 
words (promises) which proceed from the mouth of God. 

The boiling of the flesh of consecration [vs. 31] was no part of 
the sacrifice; it was merely the preparing of the portion which they 
ate. It was all to be disposed of [ver. 32], showing how we are to be 
entirely consecrated and none of our time or powers wasted. 

The seven days of consecration [vss. 33 and 35] show again 
that we are consecrated to God's service not a part of our time 
only, but all of it, for seven is the complete number in Scripture 
and signifies all or the whole of whatever it is applied to. ("Seven 
Seals," "Trumpets," "Plagues," etc.) Ver. 36 shows the completion 
of the work of consecration. 



There never was a time when it was more necessary than now, 
to see to it that we "be dead with him," and our every ability waved 
before God, that he may accept and make use of our talents to his 
glory. Especially is it of interest to those who believe that very 
soon all the members of the body will be accepted with the head-a 
sweet savor to God, and the work finished. And if we fail to be 
among the priests now during the time of consecration, we cannot 
expect to be one of them when they begin their service for the 
people in the "ages to come-when these same priests (now 
despised of men, but a "sweet savor to God," shall have the tile of 
King added, and with their head- Jesus, rule and bless all nations. 
Do we wish to be among those who will sing to the praise of our 
great High Priest, "Thou hast made us unto our God, Kings and 
Priests and we shall reign on the earth?" If so, let us be fully 
consecrated now, for "If we suffer with him we shall also reign 
with him." (2 Tim. 2:12) 



CHAPTER IV 



THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT 



Lev. 16:3-33 

In considering this type we must, to appreciate it, remember 
that it is a picture by itself, of one particular part, of the work of 
the World's High Priest, yet in the more full and complete sense he 
is the head and we the members of the body of the World's High 
Priest, just as Aaron was high priest or chief of the under priests, 
while in a general sense, the whole priesthood was one, designed to 
minister for Israel who typified the world. These Levitical pictures 
primarily referring to the Head, when fully considered refer to the 
body complete. For instance, the ceremony of anointing 
commenced with the "Head,'" but the anointing applied to all the 
body during the entire age as we have seen. As the consecrating of 
the priesthood includes all the members of his body, and requires 
all the Gospel Age to complete it, so also with the sin offering or 
the sacrifice of atonement: it commenced with the Head and we 
"fill up the measure of the sufferings of Christ which are behind," 
and therefore this suffering requires all of the Gospel Age. The 



atonement day, which in the type, was but a twenty-four hour day, 
we see then in the antitype, to be the whole Gospel Age. 

So we see that all of these pictures are separate and distinct, 
and will all be complete at the end of the Gospel Age. And then 
shall the Great High Priest of the world (Jesus and His bride, made 
ONE, Head and members complete) stand forth crowned a King 
and Priest after the Melchizedek order. 

There he will stand before the world (manifest, recognized but 
unseen) not only as King and Priest, but also as the Great Prophet- 
"A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your 
brethren, like unto me, (Moses)... and it shall come to pass that the 
soul that shall not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among 
the people." When brought to a perfect knowledge and ability, 
perfect obedience will be required, and all who will not render it 
will be cut off from rife-the second death. (Acts 3:22,23) 

There he will stand, Priest of the Most High God and King of 
Salem, i.e., "King of Peace"-"A Priest upon His throne.." 

He came typically to the Jews in the end of their age as prophet, 
(teacher) as priest ("when he offered up Himself," Heb. 7:27) and 
as King (when he rode into their city at the close of his ministry). 
But they did not receive him in any of these offices. During the 
Gospel Age, his church or body has acknowledged him as "a 
teacher sent from God"-the great Prophet; as their High Priest and 
as their King or ruler. The word teaches however, that is not by the 
church only that he is to be accepted, but He (together with us as 
his body) shall be the Prophet for the people, the Priest for all the 
people, and the King over all people, nations and languages; Lord 
of all," Priest of all, Prophet or teacher of all. 

In the type of the Priests' consecration, we saw Aaron and his 
sons representing Jesus and his body as "new creatures," and a 
bullock representing their humanity; but in the type now to be 
considered, we find Aaron representing the entire anointed one 
(head and body), and the two sacrifices, a bullock and a goat, 
representing the separateness, yet similarity in suffering of their 
humanity, as the sin offering. The bullock represents Jesus at the 
age of thirty years-the perfect man who died on our behalf. The 
High Priest as we have already seen represents Jesus, anointed to 
be the head, and also all whom God foreknew as members of his 
body. The distinction which is here made between the human and 
the "new creature," should be clearly understood. We understand 
that Jesus, the man at thirty years, was he who was previously rich 



(of a higher nature), but who for our sakes became poor; that is, 
became a man that he might give the ransom for men-a man's life. 
(1 Cor. 15:21) 

Since the penalty of man's sin was death, he must become a 
man or he never could redeem man. A man had sinned and the 
penalty was death of man, and if Jesus would pay t he penalty he 
must be of the same nature, (but undefiled, separate from sin,) and 
die, that man might in due time be liberated from death. To do this 
Jesus made sacrifice of all that was human-glory as a perfect man, 
honor as a perfect man could claim it, comfort and ease as a perfect 
man could enjoy it, and finally life as a man. And this life, was all 
he had, having exchanged his life as a spiritual being, for the 
human, which he now makes "a sin offering" as typified by the 
bullock. 

Such was the promise of Jehovah to him, viz: that he would 
highly exalt him above the human plane, and above his pre-human 
condition; above all angels, principalities and powers, to his own 
right hand, (condition of chief favor, next to Jehovah a partaker of 
immortality-the Divine nature. For these and other joys set before 
him, Jesus endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down 
at the right hand of the Majesty on high. (Heb. 1:3) 

The new nature which was received instead of the human, and 
as a reward for its crucifixion, is what we understand to be here 
typified by the priest. While it is true that the sacrifice of the 
human was not finished until the cross, and that the Divine nature 
was not fully received until the resurrection, three days later, yet, in 
God's reckoning-and as shown in this type, the death of the 
human (the bullock) was complete when Jesus presented himself a 
living sacrifice at baptism-the type of his covenant of death. There 
he reckoned himself dead-dead to all human aims or hopes of 
human glory, honor or life, in the same sense that we are exhorted 
to reckon ourselves dead indeed to the world, but alive as new 
creatures unto God. Rom 6:11 

This acceptance of Jesus by Jehovah as though dead indeed, 
was indicated by the anointing with the Holy Spirit-the earnest or 
guarantee of what he should receive when death had actually taken 
place. 

Thus considered, we see that the death of the bullock typifies 
the offering by Jesus of himself when he consecrated himself. This 
is in harmony with Paul's statement, that when Jesus consecrated- 
saying, Lo I come (as in the volume of the Scriptures it is written 
of me) to do thy will O god-to die. There he took away the first, or 
set aside the typical sacrifices that he might establish or fulfill the 
real sacrifices for sin. (Heb. 10:9, 14) Yes, there the slaying of the 



bullock occurred, and t he three years of Jesus' ministry showed 
that all human will was dead, and the body reckoned so from the 
moment of consecration. 

The anointed Jesus-filled with the Spirit; was the new divine 
creature (though not perfected as divine-until the resurrection) and 
that relationship he always claimed, saying-the works that I do are 
not mine [as a man] but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth 
the works-the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's 
which sent me. (John 14:10, 24) Not my will [as a man] but thine 
[Father-the divine] be done [in and to this earthen vessel 
consecrated to death]. (Mark 15:36) 

When the bullock was slain-when Jesus was consecrated, the 
work was done in "the Court" which we have seen typified the plan 
of human justification or perfection-the condition of faith in and 
harmony with God as men-a sinless condition-the highest 
attainment of the flesh. Jesus was in this condition, as a perfect 
man when he offered himself (the bullock in type) to God. 

Bearing in mind these distinctions, let us examine the work of 
the typical Atonement Day, that we may more clearly understand 
the reality. Aaron was washed, in order to fitly represent the 
sinlessness of the "new creature" (no one who has been begotten of 
God practices sin; because his seed abides in him and he cannot 
sin, because he has been begotten by God." 1 John 3:9, Em. 
Diaglott) The new nature cannot sin, and it keeps a constant watch 
over the old nature reckoned dead lest it come to life again. He was 
clothed with the linen garments, emblems of purity-the 
righteousness of saints. The robe of linen was an earnest of the 
glorious robe to follow; the linen girdle represented him as a 
servant through not so powerful as when girdled with the curious 
girdle of the ephod; the mitre of linen being the same as that 
belonging to the glorious apparel, proclaims his perfect 
righteousness now as then. 

So the High Priest-the Divine minded- spiritually begotten one, 
though not yet born of the Spirit, is able to accomplish the sacrifice 
of atonement. Aaron now brings his typical sacrifice as we read: 
"Thus shall Aaron come into the Holy Place (The Most Holy) with 
a young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering." 
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is for 
(represents) himself, and make an atonement for himself (the 
members of his body-the under priests) and for his house" (all 
believers, the entire "household of faith"-the Levites. And he shall 
kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for (represents) himself: 
"And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off 
the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten 
small [powdered] and bring it within the vail [the first vail "or 



door"]. And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord." 
[The censer of coals of fire was set into the top of the golden altar 
in the "Holy" and the incense crumbled over it, gradually yielding 
a sweet perfume and smoke] that the cloud of the incense 
[penetrating beyond the second vail] may cover the mercy seat that 
is upon the testimony [or which covers the Law] that he die not." 
(Ver. 3, 6, 11-13) 

Looking through the type to the antitype, let us now, step by 
step, compare the doings of Jesus with the prophetic picture. When 
Jesus had consecrated, he immediately took the human life (blood 
of the bullock) to present it before God as the ransom for ours. But 
first before entering the "Most Holy" he must tarry in the "Holy' 
and make a sweet perfume before Jehovah. He therefore took with 
him along with the blood, fire from off the altar, and his two hands 
full of sweet incense which he crumbled over the fire to cause the 
perfume. 

This illustrates how Jesus' life, after consecration was a sweet 
and acceptable perfume to the Father, attesting at once to the 
completeness of the consecration and the perfection of the 
sacrifice. The sweet incense beaten small, represents the refined 
perfection of the man Jesus. The fire from the Brazen Altar 
represents the trials to which humanity is subject; and when the 
perfections of his being (incense came in contact with the trials of 
life, he yielded perfect obedience to the Divine will-a sweet 
perfume. Thus is shown his temptation in all points, yet without 
sin. It was all consumed in the fire; so he yielded all in obedience. 
It was his two hands full which he offered thus representing his full 
capacity and ability as being tested and required. 

But while Jesus as a "new creature" was thus within the 
"Holy," enjoying the light of the golden candlestick, fed by the 
bread of truth, and offering acceptable incense fed by the bread of 
truth, and offering acceptable incense to Jehovah, let us look out 
into the Court and yet further out, beyond the Camp and see 
another work progressing simultaneously. We last saw the bullock 
dead in the Court; now the fat of it has been placed upon the 
Brazen Altar and with it the kidneys and various life-producing 
organs. They are burning furiously, for a bullock has much fat. A 
cloud of smoke called "a sweet savor to God" rises, in the sight of 
all who are in the Court-Levites-believers. 

This represents how Jesus' sacrifice appeared to believing men. 
They saw the devotion, the self-sacrifice, the loving zeal (fat) 
ascending to God as a sweet and acceptable sacrifice. They all 
knew well that with him, God was ever well pleased. They knew 
from what they saw in the Court (in the flesh) that he was 



acceptable, though they could not see the sacrifice in its full 
grandeur and perfection as it appeared in Jehovah's sight- in the 
"Holy"— a sweet incense on the Golden Altar. 

But while these two fires are burning, in the Court and the 
Holy, and their perfumes ascending at the same time, there is 
another fire outside "the camp." There the body of flesh is being 
destroyed. (Ver. 27) This represents how Jesus' work was viewed 
by the world; to them it seem foolish to spend his life in sacrifice. 
They saw not the spirit of obedience which prompted, as the Father 
saw it; they saw not the loving perfections as the believers (in the 
court condition) saw them. No, nor did they see in him their ideal 
hero and leader; they saw only those elements of his character 
which condemned them, not being in condition to love and admire 
him. To them he was odious-and outcast-despised and rejected; 
they hid their faces from him. 

Do we see then how Jesus' life for three and a half years fills 
all three of these pictures: His sacrifice of perfect manhood-in the 
sight of believers, a sacrifice acceptable to God; in the sight of 
Jehovah, "a sweet incense;"? Was entirely disposed of when Jesus 
cried, "It is finished-and died. Thus the man, Christ Jesus, gave 
himself. 

The incense from the golden altar having preceded him and 
been satisfactory, the High Priest passed under the second vail into 
the "Most Holy." So with Jesus; having for three and a half years 
offered acceptable incense, he passed beyond "the vail, that is to 
say, his flesh." For three days he was under the vail-in death-but 
then arose in the perfection of the Divine nature and the "express 
image of the Father's person:" "Put to death in the flesh, but 
quickened (made alive) in Spirit" "sown a natural (human) body, 
raised a spiritual body." He was then in the "Most Holy," or 
perfection of spiritual being. 

The next step was to present the blood (ver. 14)-The evidence 
of the redemption-for "yet were redeemed... with the precious 
blood (life) of Christ. (1 Pet. 1:19) This going into the presence of 
the Mercy Seat and sprinkling, or presenting the blood was 
evidently fulfilled by Jesus, when he, after forty days, ascended up 
on high, there to appear in the presence of God for us. 

We now leave the High Priest before the "Mercy Seat" while 
we go out to "the court" to witness another work. We quote: "And 
he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids 
of the goats for a sin offering. And he shall take the two goats and 
present them before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle. And 
Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord and 
the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat 
upon which the Lord's lot fell and offer him for a sin offering. But 



the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented 
alive before the Lord to make an atonement with him, or let him go 
for the scapegoat into the wilderness." (Ver. 5, 6-10) 

The two goats taken from Israel and brought into the "Court," 
represent true Christians: First, taken from the world condition, 
they are brought into the Court or justified condition. There they 
present themselves before the Lord-desiring to become dead with 
Christ as human beings, and to enter the heavenly or spiritual 
conditions as Jesus did-first, the spiritual mind, and secondly, the 
spiritual body. 

But as all who say: "Lord! Lord!" shall not enter the kingdom, 
so too, of those who say, "Lord, here I give myself away." They 
know not what they ask, or what it costs or denial of self, to take 
up the cross daily and follow the bullock- -to "go to him without the 
camp (to the utter disregard and destruction of the human hopes, 
etc.,) bearing the reproach with Him." (Heb. 13:13) So, we find in 
this type both classes of those who covenant to become dead with 
Christ-those who do really follow in his footsteps as he hath set us 
an example, and those who through fear o/(this) death, are all their 
lifetime subject to bondage. (Heb. 2:15) The first is the Lord's 
goat; the second the scapegoat. Both of these classes (goats) as we 
shall see, will have a part in the atonement work-bringing the 
world into complete harmony with God and his Law, when this 
"Day of atonement sacrifice (the Gospel Age) is ended. But only 
the first class (the Lord's goat) who follow the Leader, are the first 
class (the Lord's goat) who follow the Leader, are a part of the sin 
offering. (Ver. 9) "If we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with 
Him." (2 Tim. 2:12) 

The casting of lots to see which goat would be the "Lord's" and 
which the "scapegoat," indicates that God has no choice as to 
which of them shall win the prize. It shows that God does not 
arbitrarily select which shall become partakers of the divine nature 
and joint heirs with Christ our Lord. Whichever believer presents 
himself is acceptable, and he that keeps the covenant shall have the 
reward promised. 

To return to the High Priest: He having sprinkled the Mercy 
Seat with the blood of the bullock seven times (perfectly) "Then 
shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and 
bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did 
with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the Mercy Seat." 
(Vss. 14-15) In a word, that which was done with the bullock was 
repeated with the blood sprinkled just the same; its fat, etc., burned 
on the altar in the Court also. [It is worthy of notice that a prime 
bullock is always very fat, while a goat is a very lean animal.] Its 



body, was burned in like manner as that only those animals which 
were sin offerings were burned without (outside) the "Camp" (Heb. 
13:11) and then he tells us to go to him without the camp bearing 
the reproach with him. (Heb. 13: 12), "The reproaches of them that 
reproached thee, are fallen upon me." Psa. 69:9. 

The Lord's goat represented all of the "little flock," they are all 
alike-they all came by the same "narrow way; " so what is true of 
the company as a whole, is true of each one in it; therefore the 
Lord's goat typifies each one and his sacrifice, except that all must 
be complete and the sacrifice of each ended before the "blood" of 
the goat (representative of all the body will be presented on the 
Mercy Seat. 

The blood sprinkled upon and before the Mercy Seat was in the 
design of a cross, with the top or head of the cross on the Mercy 
Seat. This is shown by the description: "He shall sprinkle it with 
his finger upon the Mercy Seat eastward (toward the "door") and 
before (across, in front of) the Mercy Seat." This is the full end of 
the sin offerings for the sins of the world. The bullock, as we have 
seen, was a sin offering for the "Household of faith" the under 
priests and Levites), and the goat, was the sin offering "for the 
people"-Israel-type of the (at present) unbelieving world. 

Thus we see that this entire Gospel Age is an age of suffering 
and death, to those who crucify the human nature, to become 
partakers of the divine. Just as soon as the sacrifice of Jesus on 
behalf of his body and house was complete and presented before 
the Father, then came the evidence of its acceptance in the 
Pentecostal baptism. And this anointing (symbolized by the oil) 
which came upon the church, and continues ever since on all the 
living members of the High Priest's body- this imparting of the 
divine mine to those consecrated ones, was the energy in them 
which killed each, as the "Lord's goat." Just as the Spirit of the 
Father enabled Jesus to kill the bullock, so it was the same spirit— 
the spirit of God and of Christ in the Lord's goat company, which 
enabled them to crucify themselves as men-to kill the goat-in 
hope of the promised Glory, Honor and Immortality of the divine 
nature. 

It was thus that Paul when possessed of the spirit of his Leader 
and Head, could reckon all things but loss and dross that he might 
win (a membership in) Christ, and be found in Him. Inspired by 
this hope and spirit, he could say: "I (the new creature) live, yet not 
F' (the old creature-the goat;) it is being burned with reproach and 
contempt of the world outside the camp. My earthly affections and 
powers have all been presented an offering to God-a living 



sacrifice; now it is Christ living in me, the hope of glory-- Christ's 
mind in me-crucifying and keeping under the human nature. 

While actually in the world, he was not of it. To such an extent 
was this true that he could say-"The life which I now live, I live by 
faith in the Son of God." Yes, by faith he had become a partaker of 
the Divine nature, and was in the "Holy," feeding by faith on the 
"holy bread," enlightened daily by the light from the Golden 
Candlestick. 

Thus furnished with knowledge and strength, he was able to 
offer incense acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, and to keep the 
goat nature always sacrifice. So, too, the same thing has been done 
by the other members of this "Lord's goat" company since, though 
none have been so generally known-his sacrifice sent up a very 
rich perfume. 

As the goat filled up that which was behind of the Sin offering 
after the bullock, so do we "fill up that which is behind of the 
afflictions of Christ." (Col. 1:24 



The moment must sometime come when the last member of 
this "Lord's goat" shall have consecrated. [We believe that we are 
at just this point now, 1881-the door of opportunity to consecrate 
closed, though there is still time to carry out the consecration 
already made.] Then, soon after, when their sacrifice is consumed, 
as members of His body they shall pass beyond the second vail- 
beyond the flesh, in the perfection of the Divine nature already 
commenced in this mortal body-this earthly house. That passing of 
the second vail means to the body what it meant to the head-that 
we shall be made like unto Christ's glorious body, which is the 
express image of the Father's person. Oh! Blessed hope-"I shall be 
satisfied when I awake in Thy likeness," was spoken prophetically 
for Jesus; and how sublime the promise that "we shall be like Him- 
-like unto Christ's glorious body." Ji I may but win this prize for 
which I run- 

Perish, every earth ambition, 

All I've sought or hoped or known; 

Yet how rich is my condition, 

If winning Christ, I'm found in him. 

The Most Holy reached, we there present the evidence of the 
sacrificed life as typified by the blood of the goat sprinkled on the 
Mercy Seat. 



It will be accepted, as was that of our glorious Leader, and then 
the 

WORK OF RECONCILIATION 

will commence. Sacrifice- -the sin offering-was the basis of 
reconciliation and at-one-ment between Jehovah and the world of 
sinners. Now, the blood of the sin offering being sprinkled on the 
Mercy Seat covering the Testimony, (the Law, it was satisfied. The 
ransom paid to Justice was abundant, and now reconciliation will 
proceed-of which more again. 

"And when he had made an end of reconciling the "Holy" 
["Most Holy"] and the Altar [in the "Court"] he shall bring the live 
goat: and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live 
goat [scapegoat} and confess over him all the iniquities of the 
children of Israel [typical of the world], and all their transgressions 
in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall 
send him away by the hand of a fit man [anyone convenient] into 
the wilderness." (Vs. 20-22) 

As before expressed, we understand this "scapegoat" which 
presented itself for sacrifice with the other, but failed to perform it, 
and to walk in the steps of the bullock, to represent a very large 
class of God's children who have made the same covenant as the 
others, viz: to become dead to the world, and to crucify their 
justified human nature, but have failed. 

While this scapegoat class has existed throughout this Gospel 
Age, the one goat and the work done with it, at the close of the age 
is representative in a general sense of the dealing with each 
individual goat [person] of that company during the age. 

Let us look first at the dealing with members of this company 
who will be living when the work of sin offering is complete-the 
last members of the scapegoat company-and then see how it will 
apply to the preceding members of the same class. 

But let us first remind you that we are now dealing with things 
future: after the sin offering. The Lord's goat is not yet wholly 
consumer, consequently the "little flock," represented by the body 
of the priests, has not yet gone beyond the second vail into the 
perfect spiritual condition; and the work with living "scapegoat" is 
after all this. 



Other scriptures show us (Rev. 7:9, 13-17 and 1 Cor. 3:15) that 
there will be a "great company" who during this age have entered 
the race for the grand prize of joint-heir ship with Jesus, who do not 
"so run" as to obtain it; and that they, though "castaways" as 
regards the prize (1 Cor. 9:27), are nevertheless objects of the 
Lord's affection and love, who, by his providences through the 
circumstances of life will cause them to come through "great 
tribulations," thus accomplishing for them, "the destruction of the 
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." (1 
Cor. 5:5) Notice, they consecrated their justified human life, and 
God accepted of the consecration and reckoned them, according to 
their covenant, dead as human beings and alive as new-spiritual- 
creatures. But, by their failure to carry out the contract, they are cut 
off from the priesthood, from membership in the body of Christ- 
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away." (John 
15:2) 

These are in a pitiable condition; they have failed to win the 
prize, therefore cannot have the divine nature, nor can they have 
restitution to perfect humanity with the world, for in their 
consecration, they gave that up for the opportunity to run for the 
divine nature. But the Lord loves them, and will deliver those who 
through fear of death, (fear of contempt-fear of the reproach borne 
by the bullock and goat, beyond the Camp-in the Wilderness, or 
separated, dead condition) were all their lifetime subject to 
bondage-bondage of fear of men and men's traditions and 
opinions which always brings a snare, and keeps back from 
obedience to God-even unto death. 

Through the favor of the High Priest, this great company are to 
go into "great tribulations" and have the flesh destroyed. This will 
not place them as overcomers-the bride-the body of Christ-ew 
the throne as Kings and Priests, but in a position "before the 
throne," as perfect spiritual beings (though not of the highest order 
of the spiritual-the Divine)-not possessed of the Crown of life, 
Immortality). They shall be like unto the angels. "These shall serve 
God in His Temple" though not members of that symbolic Temple 
which is the Christ. (Rev. 7:14,15) 

Now however this class will be sent to the Wilderness 
condition of separation from the world, forced thither by "the man 
of opportunity"-adverse circumstances-there to be buffeted by 
adversity until shown the vanity, deceitfulness and utter 
worthlessness of the World's approval and until all human hopes 
and ambitions die; and they are ready to say-God's will, not mine, 
be done. The world is every ready to scorn and cast out the 



chastened and afflicted ones, though they so earnestly coveted it 
deceiving smile and its empty honors. The body of the scapegoat 
was not burned in the wilderness; only the sin offerings (bullock 
and Lord's goat) were burned. (Heb. 13:11) The burning of the sin 
offering represented the steady continuous submission of that class 
to the fiery ordeal of suffering-"faithful (willing sacrifices) unto 
death." Both classes suffer even unto death of the human will and 
body; but the first class die willingly, destroyed by continual 
crucifying of the flesh as shown by the symbol-fire, which burns 
continuously until thee is nothing more to burn. The second class is 
simply taken out to the wilderness and there left to die. Their love 
of the world's approval perishes with the world's neglect and scorn 
and reproach and their spiritual nature ripens and blooms into life. 
Both these classes have been developing side by side throughout 
the age. 

While thus in process of fulfillment throughout the entire age, 
yet it will be most marked in the case of the last of that scapegoat 
class. When the "little flock" have all gone beyond the vail, the 
hand of the Lord will set free those bound ones "who, through fear 
of death (to the world), are all their lifetime subject to bondage," 
by the overthrow of the many false theories, creeds, traditions of 
men, and great nominal Church organizations, in and to and by 
which, they are held and hindered from hearing and obeying the 
Lord's voice. 

Thus forced loose by "Babylon's" fall, while realizing that the 
great prize has been lost, they will then hear the High Priest's 
voice and find themselves forced into the Wilderness condition. 

At no other time perhaps have there been so many consecrated 
ones bound as at present; but through all the age, there have been 
some. 

Going back to Paul's day we find that there were some then, 
who had consecrated but did not perform their covenant, and 
speaking of them he says: "I verily as absent in body, but present in 
spirit judged already— to delivery such an one unto Satan, for the 
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day 
of the Lord Jesus." (1 Cor. 5: 3,5) 

This one we may reasonably presume passed through severe 
afflictions-"great tribulations" in having the flesh destroyed. 

Thus we see that both classes of {goats) consecrated ones pass 
through great trials and afflictions, yet to one class they are 
esteemed light afflictions, taken joyfully, which they rejoice to be 



accounted worthy to suffer. It is a willing sacrifice, like that of the 
Head. To the other class, they are burdensome, great afflictions, 
almost without joy-an enforced destruction of the flesh. And 
proportionately different are their positions and rewards at the end 
of life's race. 

"And Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the congregation 
("the Holy") and shall put off the linen garments which he put on 
when he went into the Holy place ("Most Holy") and he shall leave 
them there; and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place 
("the Court") and put on his [usual] garments [the garments of 
glory and beauty] and come forth and offer his burnt offering and 
the burn offering of the people, and make [having made] an 
atonement for himself [the body-the church-the "little flock"] and 
for the people." (Vss. 23 and 24) 

These burn offerings were two rams (Vss 3 and 5,): one 
representing the Bullock and the other the Lord' s goat. These being 
alike, show the harmony and oneness of the sacrifices made by 
Jesus and his footstep followers, that in God's sight they are all one 
sacrifice. "For both he that sanctifieth (Jesus) and they who are 
sanctified (the little flock) are all of one; for which cause he is not 
ashamed to call them brethren." (Heb. 2:11) 

This is further shown in the treatment of each of these 
sacrifices. The rams of "burnt offering" were cut in pieces and 
washed and the pieces laid unto the head upon the altar and burned, 
making sweet perfume-a burn offering of sweet savor unto 
Jehovah. Since both rams were thus treated, it shows that in 
Jehovah's estimation, they are all parts of one sacrifice; the 
members joined to the head, acceptable as a whole, as the 
atonement for the sins of the World-thus satisfying the claims of 
justice and purchasing the whole world of sinners. 

As the sin offerings illustrate the necessary crucifixion and 
death of the redeemer, so the burn offering illustrates God's 
manifested acceptances of the same sacrifice. Let us not forget that 
God does not manifest his acceptance of the "better sacrifices" 
than bulls and goats, until that sin offering is complete and the 
High Priest is robed in the honor and glory of his office. 

It will be burned on the Altar in "the Court," thus teaching that 
God will manifest His acceptances of the sacrifice of the whole 
body (head and pieces) in the sight of all in "the Court" condition, 
viz: all believers. But before this manifestation to believers, of 
God's acceptance of the work, the "scapegoat company" are sent 
away, and the robes of the Priest changed. As the white robes worn 
throughout the work of sacrifice— which covered the body— 
represented the justification of the body-their purity in God's sight 



as new creatures, so now the glorious garments of glory and beauty 
represent the glories of position and work in the future, after the 
new creatures have been perfected-gone beyond the vail. The 
washing with water seems to show that though the white garments 
are laid aside-the body now clothed in majesty of power is still 
pure. 

Thus ends this type of the development of the Priesthood and 
satisfaction of the world's sins. 

We tarry to glance at a few verses of this chapter (Lev. 16) not 
directly connected with the narrative. 

Vs. 17, "There shall b no man in the tabernacle of the 
congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy 
place (sanctuary "Most Holy") until he come out, and have made 
an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the 
congregation of Israel." The Apostle Paul says-"The priests went 
always into the first tabernacle (the "Holy") accomplishing the 
service, but into the second (tabernacle-the "Most Holy") went the 
high priest alone, once very year" (on the "Day of Atonement," 
which was repeated annually). 

The privileges of the tabernacle are only for those who are 
priests-members of the body of the Head Priest-so that whether 
we be now in the first of these heavenly conditions (spiritual- 
minded, new creatures in Christ Jesus), or whether we hope to 
enter into the second or perfected spiritual condition, it will in 
either or both cases be because we are in Christ Jesus, new 
creatures-no longer men. ""For yet are not in the flesh (human), 
but in the spirit (spiritual, new creatures), if so be that the Spirit of 
God dwell in you." (Rom. 8:9) 

Vs. 28, "And he that burnetii them [the bullock and goat of sin 
offering] shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and 
afterward he shall come into the camp." This seems to teach that 
those who were principally instrumental in reproaching, reviling, 
and destroying the humanity both of Jesus (bullock) and his "little 
flock" (goat) will have no special punishment for it, as they did it 
ignorantly-at the same time accomplishing God's plan. "Father, 
forgive them, they know not what they do." They wash and cleanse 
and come into the camp-i.e., come into the same condition as the 
balance of the world, all of whom are sinners, and all of whom are 
ransomed from that Adamic depravity and sin. 



Vs. 26, "And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat, shall 
wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards come 
into the camp." This teaches the same lesson relative to those who 
shall be instrumental in bringing the trouble, and consequent 
destruction of the flesh, upon the great company of those 
represented by the scapegoat. 

In the type, the Day of Atonement thus ended; and all Israel are 
reckoned no longer defiled and separate from God, but all are now 
made at one with God. Justice no longer condemns, but bids them 
realize god's reconciled presence in their midst, to bless and 
protect and direct into the Canaan of rest and peace. 

In the antitype, the day of atonement is this Gospel Age, during 
which, Jesus and his body, the Church, make sacrifices to Justice, 
in full satisfaction of the Adamic sin, thus purchasing the race of 
sinners. Because no longer condemned of justice, God will then 
recognize mankind condemned of justice, God will then recognize 
mankind and place his sanctuary among men. Then, will be 
fulfilled that which was written: "The Tabernacle of God (the 
glorified church) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and 
they shall be [become] his people, and God himself shall be with 
them and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from 
their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor 
crying, neither shall there by any more pain, for the former things 
[reign of Satan sin and death] are passed away. And he that sat 
upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new." Rev. 21:3-5 

But while all these blessings shall result from the establishment 
of God's residence, or sanctuary among men ["I will make the 
place of my feet glorious"-"Earth is my footstool,"] yet its 
blessing will be a gradual work requiring the Millennial age for its 
full accomplishment; i.e., death, pain, and tears will be in process 
of destruction (wiping away), but not completed until the end of 
the Millennial Age. 

The gradual process by which man will be brought into 
perfection of being and fullness of harmony with Jehovah, is well 
illustrated in the typical sacrifices of Israel, made after the day of 
atonement, the antitypes of which will be fulfilled during the next 
age. 

To rightly divide and understand these typical sacrifices, it 
must be recognized, that the present Gospel Age is the day of 
atonement toward God for the general sin of mankind; and that all 
sacrifices coming after the day of atonement in the type, represent 



fulfillments or antitypes due after the Gospel Age is ended-during 
the Millennial Age-when the world of sinners may become 
reconciled to, or at one with God. 

Thus we may see that at-one-ment has two parts— first, Justice 
at one with, and not any longer condemning and killing Adam and 
his children on account of his sin; and secondly, the sinner being 
brought to at-one-ment or reconciliation is brought about entirely 
by the Priest's sacrifice or what we shall term the "Day of 
Atonement sacrifices. " * 



*The sacrifices relative to the consecration of the priests and parts 
of two types yet to be considered, we regard of course, as being the 
same sacrifices as those above mentioned as taking place on the 
Day of Atonement- they being merely different views or pictures 
of the same sacrifices. 

The other-The reconciling of the World to God or the bringing 
of them into full at-one-ment and harmony with God, will be 
accomplished during the next age by the "Royal Priesthood" who, 
typified by Moses will be the Great Prophet whom the Lord will 
raise up to teach the people, to whom if they will not give heed, 
they shall be cut off from life-die the second death. (Acts 3:23) 

This Priesthood is also typified by Melchizedek, King and 
Priest. These shall rule over to bless and represent before the Lord, 
all the families of the earth. 



CHAPTER V 



THE OTHER SACRIFICES 



Those sacrifices which do not belong to the class we 
denominate the "Day of Atonement sacrifices," illustrate offerings 
and sacrifices which belong to the Millennial Age. 

As in the type, the day of atonement sacrifices preceded all 
others, and were a basis of general forgiveness and acceptance with 
God for all Israel, but were followed by sacrifices after that day, for 



individual sins, termed "Sin offerings," "Trespass offerings," etc., 
so in the antitype. After this day of atonement has brought the 
world into a justified condition, there will still be sins and 
trespasses committed, which will require confession and 
reconciliation of such transgressions afresh. 

As in the basis of all forgiveness of sins in the next age, will be 
the "Day of Atonement sacrifices," it would be appropriate for the 
sinner to bring some sacrifice, which would indicate a recognition 
of those sacrifices, as the ground for forgiveness anew. And so we 
find, that all offerings of the people after the Day of Atonement 
were of a kind which pointed back to, or recognized the sacrifices 
of that day. These offerings might be of cattle, or sheep, or fowl 
(turtle doves or young pigeons) or of fine flour, the article offered, 
depending on the ability of the offerer. But they all seem to be 
remembrancers of the atonement sacrifices. 

During the Millennial age all men "will come to a knowledge 
of the truth" and be saved from the curse of Adamic death. (1 Tim. 

2:4) 

When we remember that this death includes all the sickness, 
pain, and imperfection to which humanity is now subject, we see 
that God's plan includes a full restoration to human perfection; but 
perfection comes gradually and it will require the cooperation of 
the sinner' s will to ever reach it. He must do what he can to climb 
up again to perfection, and will have all the assistance necessary. 
This is shown by these sacrifices in general. They are to be 
according to every man's ability. If very much degraded by sin and 
very imperfect, he must when he comes to a knowledge of the 
truth, present himself to God. If thus poor and degraded he may 
bring a dove or pigeon, if less degraded he is represented by a kid; 
if less degraded still, by a goat; and when perfect as a man his 
offering may be a bullock; just as a bullock was used to typify the 
perfect humanity (much fat) of Jesus' sacrifice and as a goat 
(wayward and lean) was used to represent our imperfect human 
nature in the sacrifices of this atonement day, so those animals 
similarly represent the offerers (Israel-the world) in their sacrifices 
and consecrations. 

When the whole world has been brought to perfection there 
will be no longer any who are poor in this sense-all will be perfect 
men and their offerings antitypical bullocks. 

David speaking of this says: "Then shalt thou be pleased with 
the sacrifices of righteousness (of right doing), with burnt offering 



and whole burnt offering; then shall they offer bullocks (perfect 
sacrifice) upon thine altar." (Psa. 51:19) Yet that David's language 
should not be understood to teach the restoration of the literal 
bloody, typical sacrifices, is evident, for in the same connection he 
says, "Thou desirest not sacrifice," (the typical). ..The sacrifices of 
God are a broken spirit; and a contrite heart O God, thou wilt not 
despise." (Psa 51:16-19) But all these sacrifices must be of the free 
will and desire of the offerer. (Lev. 1:3) 

The entire consecration is shown by the death of the animal; 
that is each member of the race must consecrate his will; but it will 
neither be followed by the destruction of the human nature 
(burning of the flesh outside the camp) nor by taking of the life into 
a new nature,-shown in the case of the atonement sacrifices. No, 
when consecrated, they are accepted as human beings, their right to 
life as such, having been purchased by the Priesthood. 

THEIR BURNT OFFERINGS 

The burnt offering of the Priests was to be kept up continually 
on the Altar, and the fire never suffered to die out. "This is the law 
of the burn offering; it is (called) the burnt offering because of the 
burning upon the Altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of 
the Altar shall be burning in it... It shall not be put out, and the 
Priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt 
offering in order upon it... The fire shall ever be burning upon the 
Altar; it shall never go out." Lev. 6:9, 12, 13. 

THEIR TRESPASS OR SIN OFFERING 

"If a soul (being) commit a trespass and sin through ignorance 
in the holy things of the Lord;... if he sin and commit any of these 
things which are forbidden to be done by the Commandments of 
the Lord, though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his 
iniquity." "And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the 
flock," and money according to the priest's estimation of the 
trespass, with a fifth more, and this shall be their offering. And the 
priest shall make an atonement for him. And if any sin knowingly 
and damage or defraud his neighbor, he shall restore it in the 
principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto (twenty per cent 
interest) and give it to the wronged one. And he shall bring a ram 
for the trespass offering unto the Lord. (Lev. 5: 115-19; and 6: 1-7) 

This teaches that for every wrong, restoration must be made 
with interest, and a repentance or asking forgiveness of the Lord 
through the Church; their recognition of their own imperfection 
and the value of their ransom, being shown by the ram presented. 



Now notice the difference between the treatment of this sin 
offering and the sin offerings of the day of atonement: Those were 
offered to God (Justice) as the ransom or purchase price of sinners; 
these are offered to the Priests who purchased the people, their 
acknowledgments being to their Redeemer; while the Priest takes a 
part and offers it to the Lord as a memorial, or a recognition that 
the whole plan of redemption as executed on the Atonement Day 
[Gospel Age] was His. 

The Atonement Day offerings, we have seen, were always 
burned, (Lev. 6:30, Heb. 13:11,) but these sin offerings are not to 
be burned, but eaten by the priests. --"This is the law of the sin 
offering:... The priests that offereth it for sin shall eat it:... All the 
males among the priests shall eat thereof." (Lev. 6: 25-29) 

So the whole world, having been purchased with the precious 
blood (human life) of Christ (the anointed), will present 
themselves, for forgiveness of trespass, to the Royal Priesthood 
who paid their ransom price; and their acceptance of it will be the 
forgiveness. To this agree Jesus' words to his disciples: "He 
breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. 
Whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and 
whosoever sins yet retain (to them) they are retained." John 20:23 

While this "ministry of reconciliation" belongs in its fullest 
sense in the next age- when all the sacrifices of atonement will be 
complete-yet even now, any member of the "Royal Priesthood" 
may say to those who believe: (the household of faith) "Thy sins 
are forgiven thee"-just as our Head said, by faith, looking forward 
to the completion of the sacrifices for sins, which sacrifice he had 
begun. 

THEIR PEACE OFFERINGS 

This offering must be of the herd or flock, and it might be made 
in fulfillment either of a vow (covenant) or as a willing "thank 
offering." Part of it was to be brought to Jehovah by the offerer- 
"His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; 
the fat with the beast; it shall he bring," and the priest shall burn 
the fat on the altar, and wave the breast before the Lord. But the 
breast shall be the priest's, also the shoulder. The offerer must eat 
the sacrifice. (Lev. 3 and 7: 11-18, 30-34) 

This seems to show, that if any would come into a condition of 
full peace and harmony (as all are to do or be cut off-the second 
death), they must eat or fulfill a covenant before God, of entire 



consecration to him. If, after being thus perfected, they again 
become defiled with sin, they must die, (second death) as shown by 
the touching of unclean things. (Lev. 7: 19-21) 

With this sacrifice there was presented an offering of 
unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and anointed wafers, 
representing the offerer's faith in Christ's character, which he will 
copy; and leavened bread indicating his acknowledgment of his 
own present imperfection at time of consecration-leaven being a 
type of sin. Lev. 7: 11-13. 

THE MEAT OFFERINGS, 

composed of fine flour, unleavened cakes, with oil, etc., were 
presented to the Lord through the priest. They probably represent 
praises and worship offered to the Lord by the world, through his 
church-"Unto him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus 
throughout all ages." (Eph. 3:21) These were accepted by the 
priests; a sample being offered on the altar shows that it is 
acceptable to Jehovah. 



CHAPTER VI 



ANOTHER TYPE OF CHRIST'S SACRIFICES 



LEVITICUS 9 

This chapter seems to give a more condensed picture of the 
work and sacrifices of the Day of Atonement than the one already 
examined (sixteenth) and in addition, it furnishes certain features 
which, after the consideration of the sixteenth, will be of interest to 
us. It is another picture. 

And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded 
that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the Altar and offer thy sin 
offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself 
[the members of his body required it] and for the people" [The 
World.] 

This shows how Jesus [the bullock sacrifice for sins] was 
sufficient both to redeem his body, the "little flock," and also the 



whole world of mankind. Our share in the sin offering could have 
been dispensed with entirely, and we might have been saved from 
death just as all mankind will be-- with perfect human being 
restored. But it pleased Jehovah not only to choose Jesus to this 
great work of sacrifice, but also to make him the Captain or Head 
of His church which is His body, who, as well as their Captain, 
should be made perfect as spiritual beings, by suffering as sin 
offerings in the flesh. 

Paul, referring to our intimate relationship to our Head, says: 
"Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath 
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places [the 
"Holy" and "Most Holy"] in Christ; according as he hath chosen us 
in him before the foundation of the world... to the praise of the glory 
of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." 
(Eph. 1:4, 6) God "called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the 
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ," (2 Thes. 2:14,) 

To continue- After offering his own once for all, he was to 
"offer the offering of the people [the goat], and make an atonement 
for them as the Lord [Jehovah] commanded. " /The arrangement 
for our having part in the sacrifice of atonement, was a part of our 
Father's original plan as Paul also attests.] 

"Aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin 
offering which was for himself. And the sons of Aaron brought the 
blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on 
the horns of the altar; but the fat etc.... he burnt upon the altar,... and 
the flesh and the hid he burnt with fire without the camp. And he 
slew the burn offering (a ram), and Aaron's sons presented unto 
him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. And 
they presented the burnt offering unto him; and he did wash the 
inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the 
altar, with the pieces thereof and the head." [Much the same as the 
account in the sixteenth chapter, and having the same significance.] 

Thus the burnt offering of Jesus has been burning all through 
the Gospel Age, evidence to all in the "court" God's acceptance of 
him and the acceptance of all the members of the body-laid to the 
head, on the altar. 

"And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat which 
was the sin offering for the people (only) and slew it and offered it 
for sin as the first," i.e., treated it exactly as he treated the bullock. 
This goat is the same as the "Lord's goat" in the other picture, the 
scapegoat and other features being omitted in this more general 



view. It is, however, confirmatory of the teaching, that only those 
who follow the Lord's footsteps are participants in the sin offering. 
Who could take exceptions to this? 

"And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to 
the (usual) manner. And he brought the meat offering, and took a 
handful of it and offered it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice 
of the morning. 

He also slew the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice or peace 
offering which was for the people." The peace offering, as already 
described, represents a vow of covenant. By this peace offering, 
made in connection with the sin offering of the High Priest, is 
signified the covenants and promises based on that sin offering. In 
the type, the peace was established between Jehovah and Israel on t 
his wise: The sin offering having been made, and the burnt offering 
showing the acceptableness of it to God, there was peace between 
Jehovah and Israel because their former original sin was typically 
removed; and they were obligated to now live obedient to a 
covenant based on their forgiveness-i.e., they were to keep the 
Law-that he that doeth those things should live by (or as a reward 
for keeping) them. But as our sin sacrifices are better than the 
typical ones, so with the peace offering or covenant established by 
those sacrifices; it is a better covenant. Thus in this sacrifice of 
peace or covenant offering, the Priest is seen to serve unto the 
example and shadow of spiritual things-the mediator of a better 
covenant. Heb. 8: 6-13. 

"And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed 
them and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the 
burnt offering and peace offerings." 

Thus in the type we see illustrated the fact that though the 
blessing is not fully due to come upon the people until all sacrifices 
are finished, yet a measure of blessing comes upon mankind from 
the members of the Priest, even now during the age of sacrifice, 
before we all go into the "Most Holly" or perfected spiritual 
condition. 

"And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the 
congregation, and came out and blessed the people." 

This shows how, when this age of sacrifice is over, the Priest 
(head and body) appears before God, giving evidence of having 
met all the claims of the Law against the people (world). Moses' 
going in also, seems to say, the Law will be fully satisfied and its 



righteousness vindicated; and the Law (Moses) will testify on 
behalf of the world that it is justified to life through the sacrifices. 

When presented, the sacrifices are "holy, acceptable to God"; 
and Moses and Aaron come out, and together they bless the 
people. So in the incoming age, the Christ will bless all the 
families of the earth (Gal. 3:8, 16, 29, Gen. 12:3); yet not by setting 
aside the Law of God and excusing sin, but by restoring men to the 
perfection of humanity, in which condition they will be able to 
keep the perfect Law of God, and be blessed by it. Now, by reason 
of our inherited imperfection, though the Law says-"He that doeth 
these things (obeys) shall live by them," (shall have a right to 
continuous life)-yet none of the imperfect race can now have this 
everlasting life, because of inability to keep the Law. But, then, 
being made perfect and able to keep it, its conditions of "do and 
live" will be great blessings to all men, for whosoever will, may 
then obey and live forever in harmony and happiness and 
communion with Jehovah. 

"And the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people." As 
the blessing progresses (restoring and elevating the race mentally 
and physically) the results will become manifest. The people-the 
world in general-will recognize God's gracious love, more and 
more each day. Thus it will be that "the GLORY of the Lord will 
be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together." (Isa 40:5) They will 
come to see gradually, the length and breadth and height and depth 
of the love of God which surpasses all understanding. 

It is worthy of note that the blessing here mentioned was not a 
blessing to the under priests; no, they were represented in the 
blesser. The blessing came on all the people, who, as we have 
seen, represented the world. It is this blessing of the world by the 
one seed-the entire Christ, after all the afflictions are filled up by 
the body, (Col. 1:24) that Paul refers to, saying, that "The whole 
creation (all humanity) groaneth and travaileth in pain together- 
waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God" before they can 
experience deliverance from the bondage of corruption and 
restoration to the liberty of sons of God, as enjoyed by God's first 
human son, Adam. (Luke 3:38) 

It is doubtless this same blessing of all the people-salvation 
from death and its sting, sin-that Paul refers to, saying: "unto 

THEM THAT LOOK FOR HIM SHALL HE APPEAR THE SECOND TIME 

without (a sin offering), unto salvation." (Heb 9:28) The world 
has seen the Priest-head and body-suffer as a sin offering during 
the age. Jesus was manifested to the Jews in the flesh (as a sin 



offering); and, as Paul could say, so can all the followers in his 
footsteps, viz.: Christ is manifest in our mortal flesh. (2 Cor. 4:11) 

As the whole Christ has thus been manifest and suffered in the 
flesh, so they shall also be "glorified together" before the world; 
for the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it 
together." ["Ye are not in the flesh." Rom. 8:9] When he shall 
appear, we also shall appear with him in glory. Col. 3:4. 

But this great High Priest of the world, will be recognized only 
by them that look for him. If he were to appear in the flesh-or 
appear in the sky, it would be an appearance to all, whether looking 
for him or not but we have already seen that the Scriptures teach 
that the head has been perfected as a spiritual being, and that his 
"little flock" shall be "made like unto his glorious body. " We have 
seen that the way in which the world will see the glorified church 
will be by mental perception in the same sense that a blind person 
may properly be said to see. In the same sense we see the prize, the 
"crown of life," while we look not at the things which are seen, but 
at the things which are unseen (by organic sight); for the things 
which are seen (thus) are temporal, but the things which are not 
seen (thus) are eternal. (2 Cor. 4:18) It is in this way that the entire 
church of this age has been "looking unto Jesus"-thus "we see 
Jesus." (Heb. 2:9 and 12:2) 

This is the only way in which the human can see or recognize 
things on the spiritual plane. Jesus expresses this same idea to the 
disciples-They who recognized his spirit or mind and thus knew 
him, would be acquainted with the Father also in the same way. "If 
ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also; and from 
henceforth ye know him and have seen him." This is the only sense 
in which the world will ever see God, for "no man hath seen God 
at any time." ("Whom no man hath seen, nor can see")-the only 
begotten Son he hath DECLARED him." (1 Tim. 6:16; John 1:18) 
Jesus revealed or caused the disciples to see him by making known 
his character-revealing him as a God of Love. 

It was in this same way that the Papal system was shown by 
Luther and others, and seen by many as the ANTI-CHRIST, or as 
Paul had foretold, that wicked system-the man of sin, was 
revealed. 

Thus it is, that Jesus the head (now present to gather the 
Jewels) is being now revealed to the living of the "little flock," 
though all others continue to plant, build, etc. And know not of his 
presence. (Luke 17: 26-30) 



And thus also it will be in the Millennial day, when the 
complete Christ-the Priest-is revealed, it will be only to those that 
look for him-only those shall see him. They will see him, not by 
organic sight, but as we now see all spiritual things-Jesus, the 
Father, the prize, etc. -by faith. Man will never see the CHRIST by 
organic sight, for the same reason that they will never see Jehovah- 
-because on a different plan of being-one spirit, the other flesh. 
But we (the little flock) shall see him as he is, for we shall be like 
him- like unto Christ's glorious spiritual body, which is the 
express image of the Father's person. (1 John 3:2; Phil. 3:21; Heb. 
1:3) 

But though only those who look shall be able to recognize the 
Christ, as the deliverer who will save them from the dominion of 
death; yet this will embrace all the world, for the manner of 
revelation will be such that ultimately all must see. Every eye shall 
see him; and all in their graves, being raised to life-they that 
pierced him will realize that they crucified the Lord of Glory. He 
shall be revealed (in the sky? No) in flaming fire, (judgments) 
taking vengeance on those that know (recognize not God, and obey 
not (accept no) the gospel (good news-the deliverance). It will not 
take long for all mankind to recognize him under such 
circumstances. Now the good suffer; then shall ye discern between 
him that serveth the Lord, and him that serveth him not, for in that 
day a distinction will be manifested. (Mai. 3: 15-18) Then all, 
seeing clearly, may accept of him and have everlasting life; for 
"We trust in the Living God, who is the Savior of all men, 
specially of those that believe." (1 Tim. 4:10) 

This the types illustrate-" And as it is appointed unto men 
(Aaron and his successors who were only types of the High Priest 
of the new creation) once to die (typically, as represented in the 
animals slain) and after that, (following as a result of those 
sacrifices) in the judgment (of God was manifested, as accepting 
the offering-the priest coming out to bless, for all whom he made 
atonement-all the people.) So Christ (head and body) was once 
offered (never will it be repeated) to bear the sins of many ("every 
man") and unto them that look for him, he shall appear the second 
time, without sin unto salvation." (Not again to be sacrificed for 
the sins of the people, but to bless them.) Heb. 9:27,28. 

Many have been looking in an indefinite way for a good time to 
come, and the removal in some way of the curse, speaking of 
whom, Paul says: "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
pain together until now, waiting for the manifestation of the 



SONS OF GOD "--Jesus the Head or Chief, and all the body complete 
in him. (Rom. 8: 19,22) 

"And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed 
upon the altar the burn offering and the fat, which, when all the 
people saw, they shouted and fell on their faces"-worshipped. This 
is the same thought expressed in another form. The fire symbolizes 
God's acceptance; its being recognized by the people, shows that 
the world will realize the sacrifice and its value in God's 
estimation as the price of their liberty from death and the grave; 
and when they realize it, they will worship Jehovah and his 
representatives-the Priest. 

How beautifully these types teach of a restitution, and a full 
ransom for all the people, and a blessing coming upon all. Nothing 
in the types seems to make a distinction between the living and the 
dead, and some may be inclined to say, well, perhaps when the 
sacrifices of the High Priest are over and the blessing commences, 
those who are then living will be greatly benefited. Nay, but we 
answer, in God's estimation the living and dead are alike-he 
speaks of them all as dead-all died in Adam, and all the little 
spark of life which any man possesses is really but one stage of 
dying. It is a dead race because of the sin of Adam (and Eve), and 
it will be a race justified to the same life then enjoyed and 
forfeited; and all who will, may have it back, whether they have 
gone all the way down into death, or whether they still linger on the 
brink-in "the valley of the shadow of death. 

This is the object of the sin offerings-to release mankind from 
the dominion of death, to the perfection of being which is essential 
to perfect happiness and at-one-ment with his Creator. This is the 
blessing which comes to all the families of the earth through "The 
Seed of Abraham. This is the good news which was preached to 
Abraham, as we read: God foreseeing that he would justify the 
heathen (all mankind-Gentiles) through faith, preached before the 
gospel (good news) to Abraham, saying, In thee, and in thy seed 
shall all nations be blessed-(justified)... which seed is Christ- 
primarily the head, and secondarily the body— fox if ye be Christ's 
(members) then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the 
promises (above referred to-viz.: that we may bless all the families 
of the earth.) But the Seed must be complete before the blessing 
comes, as shown in the type just considered: The sin offerings must 
be ended before all the blessings resulting can flow out. 

While the sacrifices of the people (Israel-the world) belong to 
the next age and will then be presented to the priests, yet in a 



certain sense this has a very slight beginning now. Thus it is, that 
the worldly man who possesses wealth, and is in that sense a 
steward of God's things, can use that "mammon" and with it make 
for himself friends. That when this age of Satan's rule is no longer 
be the Steward, then, those whom he thus favored will bless him 
and minister to his necessities. If the worldly Stewards of wealth 
(the mammon or God of this age) were wise, they would use their 
means thus. For whosoever shall give a cup of cold water even, 
unto his reward when the kingdom of Christ is organized and rules. 
(Luke 16: 1-8 and Matt. 10:42) 

On the contrary, the High Priest went in there often in after 
days. It was into the Most Holy that the High Priest went whenever 
he would inquire for Israel, using the breast-plate of Judgment and 
Urim and Thumim. Again, whenever they broke camp, which was 
often, the Priest went in and took down the Vails and wrapped up 
the "Ark" and all the holy vessels, before the Levites could carry 
them. (Num. 4: 5-16) 

Again, whenever an Israelite offered a sin offering unto the 
priests (after the "Day of Atonement" sacrifices were over) they all 
ate it in the Most Holy. (Num. 18: 10) So with the antitype, after 
the present "Day of Atonement" is over we shall be in the Most 
Holy or perfect spiritual condition and there accept (eat) the 
sacrifices for sin, brought by the world, for all their own 
transgressions-not the Adamic sins which were canceled on the 
Day of Atonement. There in the perfect spiritual condition, the 
priesthood shall instruct as to all matters. (Urim and Thumin) 



CHAPTER VII 



OTHER SIGNIFICANT TYPES 



In the preceding description we have purposely omitted an 
explanation of some interesting details which can be better 
understood by those who have, through careful study, obtained a 
clear understanding of the general plan of the Tabernacle, its 
service, and their typical signification. 

The posts which stood in the court and held up the white 
curtains, represent justified believers. They are in the "Court," the 



proper place for such, as we have already seen. They are of wood, a 
corruptible material. This shows that they are not actually perfect 
as human beings; for since human perfection is represented by 
copper, those posts should be either made of copper, or covered 
with copper to represent actually perfect human beings. They were 
made of wood, but were set into sockets of copper, which teaches 
us that, though actually imperfect, their standing is that of perfect 
human beings. It would be impossible to more clearly represent 
Justification by faith. 

The white curtain, well illustrates the same justification or 
purity. These justified ones should continually hold up the view of 
the world (the camp)-Christ's righteousness as their covering. 

The silver hook, by which the posts hold up the curtain, are 
symbolic of truth; they can really and truthfully claim that Christ's 
righteousness covers all their imperfection. Lev. 27: 11-17. 

The Posts at the entrance of the Tabernacle-at the door of the 
Holy- -were covered by the first vail. They were totally different 
from the posts in the court, and represent the difference between 
the justified and consecrated, or sanctified conditions. The 
consecration to death of a justified man, we have seen to be the 
way into the "Holy." The way into the new nature is by passing 
through, the death of the human will-the fleshly mind-the first 
vail. Hence these posts should illustrate this change; and so they 
do: they were covered with gold, symbol of the divine nature. 
Being set in sockets of copper, represents how "we have this 
treasure (divine nature in earthen vessels" (2 Cor. 4:7)— I.e., our 
new nature is based upon and rests in, our justified humanity. This, 
it will be remembered, corresponds exactly with what we found the 
"Holy" to symbolize, viz: our place or standing as new creatures, 
not yet perfected. (Exod. 26:37) 

The Posts in the "Most Holy" were just inside the second vail, 
and represent those who pass beyond the flesh (vail) entirely, into 
the perfection of the spiritual condition. These posts were so 
constructed as to fully illustrate this-covered with gold, 
representing divine nature, but no longer set in sockets of brass-no 
longer dependent on any human condition; they were set in sockets 
of silver (reality-truth) which seems to say to us: When you come 
inside this vail you will be perfect-really and fully new creatures. 
(Exod. 26: 32) 

"Finish then thy new creation" 



The Golden Candlestick was all of one piece, hammered out; 
there was one central shaft with a lamp on top, and three branches 
on each side of it, each bearing a lamp, making seven lamps in all— 
a perfect or complete number. Does not this represent the complete 
church from the Head, Jesus, to and including the last member of 
the "little flock." He is taking out from among men, to be partakers 
of the (gold) divine nature? Jesus says, "The seven candlesticks 
which thou sawest are the seven churches." Rev. 1: 20. Yes, that 
candlestick represents the entire church of the first born. Not the 
nominal, but the true church is here meant however-the royal 
priests-wholly consecrated. 

The form of workmanship was beautiful-a fruit and a flower, a 
fruit and a flower following successively, shows us that the true 
church ("whose names are written in heaven") is both beautiful and 
fruitful from first to last. The lamp part on top of each branch was 
shaped like an almond, the significance of which, we will see when 
considering Aaron's rod. 

The oil for this lamp was the olive oil-beaten-refined; and the 
lamps were kept lighted always. It was for the benefit of the priest 
class only, and represents the deeper spiritual truths of God's 
Word, which are entirely hidden from the natural man (1 Cor. 2: 
14), even though he be a belie ver-a justified man (a Levite). None 
are permitted to go or even to see, into this deeper royal priesthood. 
These always had access to the "Holy"; it was their right and 
privilege; it was intended for them. (Heb. 9: 6) The Levites could 
not see in because of the vail of human-mindedness which came 
between them and the Sacred things; and the only way to set it 
aside was to consecrate and sacrifice wholly the human nature. The 
lights were to be trimmed and replenished every morning and 
evening, by the High Priest-Aaron and his sons who succeeded 
him in office. (Exod. 27: 20-21; and 30: 8) So our High Priest is 
daily filling us more and more with the mind of Christ, and 
trimming off the dross of the old nature. 

Are we sometimes puzzled to know why some who are in the 
church cannot see any but natural things-cannot discern the deeper 
spiritual truths of the Word? They can see Restitution for natural 
men, but cannot see our heavenly calling. These Tabernacle lessons 
show us why this is: "They are brethren, of the household of faith," 
but Levites-in the Court; they never consecrated as priests, 
consequently cannot enter the "Holy," nor see the things that were 
prepared for the priests only. The natural "eye hath not seen, or ear 
heard-neither have entered into the heart of man the things which 
God hath prepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed 



them unto us by His Spirit [light of the Lamp], for the Spirit 
searcheth [revealeth] all things-yea, the deep [hidden] things of 
God." (1 Cor. 2:9) 

The church nominal has always included both the justified and 
sanctified classes-Levites and Priests. In Paul's day certain parts 
of his letters were addressed to the justified class (Levites), who 
had not consecrated. Thus, after exhorting in Gal. 5, he winds up 
by assuring them, that the things he complains of, are evidences 
that they do not belong to the body of Christ (Priesthood); for, he 
says, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the 
affections and lusts." Verse 24. 

In the same way he addresses the Romans (Ch. 12: 1): "I 
beseech you therefore, brethren [believers-justified by faith in 
Christ-Levites], by the mercies of God [manifest through Christ in 
our justification], that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice; 
[that you consecrate wholly thus becoming priests] holy, 
acceptable unto God." Being justified freely by faith in Jesus, God 
reckons you as sinless-holy-and has agreed to accept every such 
sacrifice-"With such sacrifices he is ever well pleased." By so 
doing you become priests-members in particular of the High 
Priest's body. 

The succeeding verse tells them what will result from so 
consecrating— viz.: The transformation of their minds. Their wills 
being renewed, they will be priests-new creatures, possessing the 
spirit of Christ. The fact that at this time they have not the spirit of 
sacrifice-glad obedience to God's will, is an evidence that they are 
not members of Christ, he is none of His." (Rom. 8: 9) And it 
seems evident to us, that by far the larger proportion of the early 
churches (much more so of the modern worldly mixture- 
confusion-Babylon, of the present day) were merely Levites, doing 
the service of the Sanctuary, but not sacrificing. 

Looking back at the type in the Law, we find that there were 
17,160 Levites appointed in the shadowy service, while only five 
Priests were appointed for the shadowy sacrificing. (Num. 4: 36, 
40, 44, 48; Ex. 28:1) It may be that this, as much as the other 
features of that shadow, was designed to illustrate the proportion of 
justified believers to self-sacrificing consecrated ones. Though now 
the nominal church numbers millions, yet when a fair allowance is 
made for hypocrites, and one in every three thousand of the balance 
supposed to be living sacrifices, (a correct proportion according to 
the type,) it seems quite evident that the Lord did not make a 
misstatement when He said, that they who would receive the 



kingdom (the Royal Priesthood) would be a "little flock." (Luke 
12:32) 

The fact that we see believers who are trying to put away their 
sins, is not of itself evidence of their being Priests, for Levites, as 
well as Priests, should practice circumcision of the heart-"putting 
away the filth (sins) of the flesh." Nor is a spirit of meekness, 
gentleness, benevolence, and morality, always a result of 
consecration to God. These qualities belong to a perfect natural 
man-(the image of God), and in occasional instances partially 
survive the wreck of the fall. These, when in the nominal church, 
not infrequently pass for the cream of Christianity. 

Nor yet, when we see believers practicing self-denial in some 
good work of political or moral reform, is that an evidence of 
consecration to God, though it is an evidence of consecration to a 
work. Consecration to God says, any work, any where; Lo, "I 
delight to do Thy will, O God-Thy will in Thy way be done. 

CONSECRATION TO God, THEN, WILL INSURE A SEARCHING OF HIS 

revealed plan IN his word, that we maybe able to spend and be 
spent, for Him and in His service. 

Marvel not, then, that so few have ever seen the glorious 
beauties within the Tabernacle; only Priests can see them. The 
Levites may know of them only as they hear them described. They 
have never seen the hidden light and beauty; never eaten of the 
hidden bread; never offered the acceptable incense at the Golden 
Altar. No, for these they must pass the vail-in entire consecration 
to God. 

The Golden Table bearing the shew bread, represents the 
church as a whole, including Jesus and the apostles-all "Holding 
forth the word of life." (Phil. 2: 16) The great work of the true 
church during this age, is to feed and strengthen and enlighten all 
who enter the covenant- spiritual condition-The Bride of Christ is 
to make herself ready. (Rev. 19:7) 

The Golden Altar seems also to represent the entire 
(consecrated) church in the present sacrificing condition. From this 
altar ascends the sweet incense, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
Here is offered to God the priest's willing services-owr praises, 
our willing obedience, all things whatsoever we do, to the glory of 
God. Those who thus offer incense acceptable to God by Jesus 
Christ our head (1 Pet. 2: 5), come very close to their Father-close 
up to the vail; and if they have requests to make they may be 
presented with the incense "much incense with the prayers of the 



saints." (Rev. 8:3) The prayers of such priests of God are 
effectual. Jesus kept the incense continually burning and could say, 
"I knew that thou hearest me always." (John 11: 42) So we will be 
heard always, if we continually expect to have requests recognized 
who do not thus keep their covenant-"!f ye abide in me and my 
words [teachings] abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it 
shall be done unto you." (John 15:7) 

We have learned through types previously considered, 
something of the glory of the Most Holy (the perfect, divine 
condition) which no man can approach in Christ Jesus-partaker of 
the Divine nature, will finally come. We would now endeavor to 
learn what God has designed to symbolize by the "Ark of the 
Testimony," its only article of furniture. Its name suggests that it 
illustrates the embodiment of Jehovah's plan, which he had 
purposed in himself, before the lapse of ages had developed even 
the head of the Christ, or the minutest beginning of his plan. It 
represented the purpose of God to develop a little flock, to be 
partakers of the Divine nature. It contained the Law showing how 
the Christ should meet in full, all the requirements of God's perfect 
Law, and also that legal authority should be vested in him as the 
Law-giver. 

The righteousness of the Law was actually fulfilled in our head, 
and it is also fulfilled actually in us as new creatures who walk not 
after the flesh, but after the Spirit; that is, who walk in obedience to 
the new mind. The infirmities of the old nature which we are daily 
crucifying, are not charged to us as new creatures. 

When it is written that "the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled 
in us"-the end of our race-perfection is reckoned to us, because 
we are walking toward, or after the spiritual perfection, which, 
when we reach the Most Holy (Ark condition) will be completed. 

Aaron's Rod that budded, shows the select character of all the 
body of Christ, as members of the royal priesthood. By reading 
Num. 17, the meaning of the budded rod will be seen to be, 
Jehovah's acceptance of Aaron and his sons-the head and under 
priests-as the only ones who might perform the priest's office of 
Mediator. That rod, therefore represents the acceptableness of the 
"royal priesthood"-the Christ, Head and body. 

It budded and brought forth almonds. A peculiarity about the 
almond tree, is, that the fruit comes before any leaves appear; so 
with the "royal priesthood;" they sacrifice or bring forth fruit, 
before the leaves, or professions are made. 

The Golden Pot of Manna represents Immortality as being one 
of the possessions of the Christ of God. Jesus doubtless refers to 
this, when he says: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of 



the hidden manna." (Rev. 2:17) Manna was the bread which came 
down from heaven-a life sustainer; so God provides life for all 
Israel (the world) that they may live forever-continually eating of 
it; but he offers to those who become joint heirs-members of the 
anointed boy (all overcomes) that they shall have a peculiar sort of 
manna, or life principal, the "hidden manna." One peculiarity of 
this pot of manna was, that it was incorruptible; hence it well 
illustrates the immortal and incorruptible condition promised to all 
members of the seed- which is Christ. 

Here then in the golden Ark, is represented the glory 
to be revealed in the Divine Christ; in the budding of the rod, 
God's chosen priesthood; in the tables of the Law, the righteous 
law-giver; in the golden bowl of incorruptible manna, immortality 
in divinity. 

Above this Ark, and constituting a lid, or head of it, was the 
Mercy Seat-a slab of solid gold, on the two ends of which, and of 
the same piece of metal were formed two cherubim, with winds 
uplifted as if ready to fly-their faces looking inward toward the 
center of the plate on which they stood. Here, between the 
cherubim on the Mercy seat, a bright light appeared, indicating 
Jehovah's presence. 

To our understanding that Mercy Seat, glory light, and 
cherubim, all together, represented Jehovah God. As with the 
Christ, so with Jehovah-He is here represented by things which 
illustrate attributes of His character. The light reminds us of Paul' s 
word: (1 Tim. 6: 16) God "only hath immortality, dwelling in light, 
which no man can approach unto." Humanity cannot enter his 
presence; hence, the priesthood, head and body, represented by 
Aaron, must become new creatures, "partakers of the divine nature 
(having crucified and buried the human) before they can appear 
before that excellent glory. 

The slab of gold or Mercy seat, we believe represents the 
underlying principle of Jehovah's character- JUSTICE. His throne 
or mercy seat is based upon justice. "Judgment and justice are the 
habitation of thy throne." (Psa 89: 14; Rev. 15:3; Job 36: 17 and 
37:23;Isa. 56:1) 

The two cherubim represent two elements of our Father's 
character as revealed in his Word-viz: mercy and love. These 
attributes-Mercy, Love and Justice, are in perfect harmony with 
each other. They are all made of one piece; they are thoroughly 
one: Neither Mercy nor Love can be exercised, until Justice is fully 
satisfied: Then they fly to help, to lift up and to bless-They were 



on the wing but waiting, looking inward toward the mercy seat- 
Justice, to know when to act. 

Now, see the High Priest as he approaches with the blood of 
the atonement sacrifices; will he put it upon the cherubiml No, 
neither the Mercy nor the Love of God require the sacrifice; he 
need not, therefore, sprinkle the cherubim. It is the Justice of God 
that will by no means clear the guilty- It was Justice that said that 
the wages of sin is death. When, therefore, the High Priest would 
give a ransom for sinners, it is to Justice that it must be paid. 
Therefore, we see why he sprinkled the blood upon the Mercy Seat. 

Love, led to the whole redemptive plan. It was because God so 
loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son to redeem it, by 
paying to Justice the ransom. So Love has been active, preparing 
for the redemption ever since sin entered-yet "from before the 
foundation of the world." (1 Pet. 1: 20) 

"Love first contrived the way 
To save rebellious man." 

When the sacrifices (bullock and goat) are complete, Love 
tarries to see the results of its plan. As the blood is sprinkled, 
Justice cries, it is enough. Then must come Mercy's time to work 
for those whom God so loved; and Love and Mercy wing their 
flight to bless the ransomed race through the Redeemer-the 
"Lord's anointed." When Justice is satisfied, Mercy starts out upon 
her errand which is co-extensive with that of Love, and uses the 
same agency-the Christ. 

The relationship and oneness of all of that divine family 
[Father, Son and his bride], represented by the Ark and its cover is 
shown in the fact that the Mercy Seat was the lid of the Ark, and 
hence a part-the top or head of it. As the head of the church is 
Christ Jesus, so the head of the entire Christ is God. (1 Cor. 11:3) 
This is the oneness for which Jesus prayed, saying: Father "I pray 
not for the world, but for those thou has given me"-"that they all 
may be one; as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also 
may be one in us-that the world may [then] believe." (John 17: 9, 
21) 

It is significant also, 

that any member of the priesthood that had a blemish of eye, hand, 
nose, foot, or in any way, could not fill the office of Priest (High 
Priest); neither any man having any superfluity, such as an extra 
finger, or toe. This seems to each us all of the perfection of every 



member of that body-they are all "overcomers:" and furthermore, 
that when the body of Christ is complete, there will be no additions 
permitted-no superfluity. If then, we are not called; if we have 
heard the invitation to become members in particular of his body, 
and have accepted it, let us seek to make our calling and our 
election (as members of that "little flock") sure, by so running to 
obtain the prize. If we miss the prize, some one else will win in our 
place, for the body must be complete; not one member lacking, no 
one superfluous. Take heed "that no man take thy crown." Rev. 
3:11. 

It has been a matter of surprise to some, that the glories and 
beauties of the Tabernacle-its golden walls, its golden and 
beautifully engraved furniture, and vails of curious work- were so 
completely covered and hidden from view of the people; no 
sunlight from without even to illuminate its glorious beauty. But 
this is all in keeping with the lessons we have received from its 
services. As God covered the type and hid its beauty under skins 
and curtains, so the glories and beauties of spiritual things are seen 
only when within by those who enter-the Royal Priesthood. These, 
too, enter a hidden glory which the world and all outside fail to 
appreciate. Their glory also and their standing as new creatures are 
hidden from their fellow men. 

"Ah; these are of a royal line, 
All children of a King, 
Heirs of immortal crowns divine, 
And lo, for joy they sing! 

Why do they, then, appear so mean ? 
And why so much despised? 
Because of their rich robes unseen 
The world is not apprised. " 



CHAPTER VHI 



THE CLEANSING OF THE SANCTUARY 



THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION IN THE HOLY PLACE 

"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation 
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place," etc. 
Matt. 24: 15; Mark 13: 14. 

In relating to his disciples the things which should come to pass 
before his presence, and before the end (harvest) of the Gospel Age 
(vss. 3-14), Jesus told them there would be many wars and 
commotions, etc., and that this Gospel must first be preached for a 
witness unto all nations. Then, calling their minds backward on the 
streams of time, he tells them of the great abomination of 
desolation, and indicates that it will be something very marked. 

The words holy place in this text, and sanctuary in the 
corresponding passage in Daniel, signify sacred place. We believe 
that Jesus made a twofold use of it, referring to the desecration of 
the Holy Land and its desolation, and the giving over of that people 
(the typical sanctuary and the host) to their enemies. But we 
believe that the prophecy of Daniel, and also Jesus' reference to it, 
apply really and with tenfold emphasis, to things typified by that 
people and holy land, viz: a desolating abomination which would 
gain control over the Christian "host"-believers-and tread them 
down, while defiling their dwelling place-the Sanctuary of truth. 
We have seen that what to the Israelite was a holy place, is to the 
Gospel Church a holy condition; place being used to typify 
condition. Our condition is sanctification in the truth, and when the 
truth was corrupted by the introduction of errors which made void 
the Word of God, it was an abominable pollution of our 
"Sanctuary"— a. desolating abomination which caused the 
overthrow of the Lord's people (the "hosf'-believers). 

This double significance, we think, is true of very much of 
Jesus' teachings-as well as of the prophecies. The desolating 
abomination to the Holly Land was the Roman army under Titus, 
who destroyed and made it desolate literally; and the abomination 
which desecrated the Sanctuary of truth was Papacy, (the "Man of 
Sin"-the world united to the degenerated church, thy twain 



becoming one) which trampled the truth of God into the dust, and 
exalted the traditions of men. She, the harlot church, was made 
drunk with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus, and 
deceived all nations, and has so impregnated them with her false 
doctrines, that they must, with her, drink of the wine of wrath of 
God ere they will be prepared for the blessings of his kingdom. The 
latter is the real abomination in the real holy place, while the 
former is its shadow. 

Jesus referred us to Daniel, therefore let us examine his works: 
Out of the Grecian Empire came forth (or after it) "a little horn" 
(Rome-pagan), and "it waxed great even unto the host of heaven; 
and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, 
and stamped upon them." (Dan. 8: ). 

Rome, became great and strong, and persecuted the true saints 
and cast down and abused some of them; both of the (stars) 
teachers and of the (host) believers. 

"Yea, he magnified himself even unto the prince of the host" 
(vs. 11), i.e., Rome became Papal-the prince or head of the 
church. In the union of empire and church, the church (women) lost 
her personal identity and was recognized as part of the "Man of 
Sin." 

"And by him the continual sacrifice (Young's translation) was 
taken away, and the base of his sanctuary was cast down." (Vs. 1 1) 
By the influence of the empire the "Mass" --or missa was 
introduced in the fifth century. The significance of the mass is not 
generally understood by Protestants. Roman Catholics regard it as a 
real sacrifice of Christ. In what is called the doctrine of 
"Transubstantiation," the Roman church teaches us that in the 
wafer and wine, Jesus' body and blood are actually present, and 
that when broken and poured, the sacrifice of Jesus is 
accomplished afresh. They believe that only through the repetition 
of this sacrifice can the sinner approach God. 

By the introduction of the "mass" or special sacrifices, they set 
aside the one real sacrifice which should be esteemed a 
CONTINUAL SACRIFICE. And thus the influence of the "horn" 
(empire) took away the "continual sacrifice'" by introducing the 
"mass"; thus the base of his sanctuary (or fundamental underlying 
principle of truth) was cast down." "And the host (nominal church) 
was given over (to this deplorable condition) for (or because of) 
the transgression against the "continual sacrifice." (Vs. 12, Margin- 
-Young's trans.) 



"And it (the Roman horn or power) cast down the truth to the 
ground, and it practiced and prospered." It had great success (Vs. 
12). Thus, this Roman power by overcoming the church, has 
defiled God's sanctuary. This is that of which Paul speaks, 
concerning this same horn power, or "man of sin": That he would 
oppose and exalt himself above all that is called (after the name of) 
God (God's sons) so that he as God (the chief- instead of their 
head-or as Christ's vicar) sitteth in the temple (church- sanctuary) 
showing himself that he is God (the ruler or head of the temple or 
church). (2 Thess. 2:3) 

Then Daniel heard one inquire of another how long this 
abomination of error would continue to desolate and desecrate the 
sanctuary-"the holy" and the host, the nominal church. And he 
heard the answer: "Until 2300 days, then is the holy place declared 
right." (Vss. 13, 14, Young's trans.) 

Since we are interested in ascertaining when the Sanctuary will 
be cleaned of defilement, we would count the number here given. 
Daniel did not understand, and made the vision a subject of prayer, 
in answer to which Gabriel is sent to give him a partial explanation 
(for our sakes) which is recorded in chapter (: 22-27. Seventy 
weeks (490 days) of this 2300 days would be of special interest to 
Daniel, as that part of it measured Israel's favor. Sixty-nine of 
these weeks were to reach unto Messiah the Prince (Jesus' baptism 
and anointing), and one to follow. 

These were not literal days or weeks, but were fulfilled as 
symbolic time -each day a year: the 69 weeks reaching to the 
anointing; the 70th week reaching 3-1/2 years beyond the cross, 
October A.D. 36. Messiah was cut off-died-in the midst of the 
70th week. All must be symbolic time, if a part was. If, then, 490 
years of this 2300 years ended in A.D. 36, we can ascertain readily 
where the whole number will end. Deducting from A.D. 36, which, 
added, shows us that the 2300 days were full in October, 1846; and 
there the Sanctuary or "holy" should be "cleansed" or "made 
right," or purified from the abominations and errors brought into it 
by the influence of the Roman Empire ("horn".) 

But the inquiry comes: In what sense was this cleansing from 
those errors accomplished in 1846? We look backward and see 
how the sanctuary of truth was defiled. The church, as established 
in the truth of God, was all wheat, but soon the enemy brought in 
false doctrines developing tares. This evil, Paul said, already began 
to foment and defile in his day, and would increase unto the more 
ungodliness, ultimately resulting in the harlotry of the church-her 



union with the world, etc., and the development thus, of the "man 
of sin" in the control of the Sanctuary, or holy things of the Lord. 
Paul also tells of the Reformation, when the power of this man of 
sin and his erroneous teachings would begin to consume- -"Whom 
the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth." (2 Thess. 
2:8) This-the Spirit of Christ's mouth-the truth-has been doing 
the cleansing work. 

When Luther began to question the teachings of Papacy on 
various subjects, venerable with age, and respectable because of 
their almost universal acceptance among the people, and hallowed 
because of the superstitious reverence for the clergy of the Church 
of Rome, who advocated them-then the cleansing commenced. 

We repeat that when Luther and others-as member of the 
"royal priesthood" began to see in God's holy place— Sanctuary- 
such abominations as the selling of "indulgences"-absolution of 
sins past or future for money; the doctrine of Transubstantiation or 
the actual presence and repeated sacrifice of Jesus in the Mass; the 
doctrine of the infallibility of the church and its creeds as the 
exponents of truth; the claim that the Pope is the head of the 
church, or Vicar of Christ, etc., they saw the defilement, and 
forthwith commenced its removal. 

Luther claimed justification by faith and not by works; that 
Christ was the only head and all truly his are his members, and are 
brethren; that the Word of God in the only rule of faith and 
practice; and that any doctrine unsupported by it is unworthy of 
acceptance, though it be hoary with age. He pointed to Papacy as 
the "man of sin," or as shown in another symbol (Rev. 17) the 
woman seated o n, (controlling) the beast (empire), drunken with 
the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus; having a golden cup in 
her hand full of filthiness, the abominable errors of doctrine and 
practice) having in her forehead the name written MYSTERY (of 
iniquity)-BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF 
HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH- the 
abomination that defiled and made desolate, the holy place. And he 
began to overturn those filthy traditions and to cleanse the 
Sanctuary. 

He did, perhaps, his share of the great work, but soon 
reformation ceased in the church he established. It rested from its 
labors self satisfied, that it had obtained all the truth, and got rid of 
all the abominable error. But still the work went on; one truth after 
another being discovered hidden under Papal error, and brought to 
light by new reformers, each in turn, however following the same 



course-organizing a sect contented and satisfied that they had all 
truth and no error. 

Among the more prominent of these later reformations, which 
after developing a neglected truth, were themselves laid aside, 
because they became proud and sectarian and ceased to carry on 
reform, we might cite the following: Presbyterians and 
Congregationalists as among the most prominent exponents of the 
doctrines of Calvin. The principal value of the doctrines of Calvin 
as off-setting Papal errors, were we believe, the teaching of the 
necessity of applying rules of holy living to the people, as well as 
to the priests; the accountability of each to God direct, and the 
greatness, omnipotence and foreknowledge of God, and the 
immutability of his promises and plans. 

The Baptists represented another long lost sight of doctrine, 
and called the attention of the world to how Papacy had changed 
the outward form of baptism, from immersion to sprinkling. 

A later reform was instituted by a people calling themselves 
"Disciples" or "The Christian Church," organized in 1827. The 
leader was Alex. Campbell, and the reform advocated was in 
respect to church organization, discipline, creeds, and the 
abrogation of all titles for its ministers, etc. Its aim was to be as 
much as possible like the Apostolic arrangement, embodying 
simplicity and liberty. Its design was good and to some extent 
successful, but it ceased to carry forward the reform to liberty of 
teaching, and study of the word. Though bound by no written 
creed, yet respecting traditions and honors of men, it has also 
become a fixed sect which no longer leads in the search for truth, 
and the cleansing of the sanctuary from Papal errors, but is like 
others, self-satisfied. 

While we mention only a few of these reform movements, let 
no one understand us as ignoring others; the reform has been 
general, and all earnest true Christians have participated in it to 
some extent. 

But while all these reforms had been for good, and each had 
removed some of the musty and worshipped error, yet some 
remained until about 1846. Do not misunderstand us; much still 
exists, and is still worshipped by God's children; but there we 
think for the first time for nearly 1300 years, a little company of 
people got free from all of Papacy's snares of entangling error- The 
sanctuary of truth was cleansed. 



This last reform received its first impulse from William Miller, 
in America, who having for some years studied the Prophetic 
Scriptures, and having convinced himself and some friends, that 
the Lord would come and the world would be destroyed by fire in 
1843 or 1844, began to preach it. He attracted the independent 
thinking Christians from all denominations, and by his preaching 
greatly stirred them up to the private study of the Scriptures, and 
developed, and made strong, the right of private judgment, as to 
what are the teachings of Scripture. "The Bridegroom tarried"- 
their expectations were not realized; but that movement had a 
widespread influence nevertheless. The "wheat" among the 
disappointed ones had obtained some new ideas. They had learned 
that doctrines they had supposed fixed by the World of God, had 
no better basis than the decrees of a corrupt church which God 
called an "abomination" They had learned that the reformers had 
only uncovered a part of the truth; that truth had not all been 
revealed in past ages, but, that God had declared to the Prophets 
that some truths were "sealed" up and closed "until the time of the 
end," when knowledge should increase, and the (heavenly) wise 
should understand things "which from the beginning of the world 
hath been hid in God:" "even the mystery which hath been hid 
from [former] ages and generations." (Dan. 12: 4, 9, to; Eph. 3:9; 
Col. 1:26.) 

This was a valuable lesson, as it led them the more to study 
God's Word, rather than follow the example of others, in studying 
the traditions and creeds of past ages. They had been freed from 
servility to honor and respect in the various denominations from 
which they had been cut loose by their obedience to their 
convictions, in regard to Mr. Miller's teachings. Honesty to 
convictions of duty, always brings some blessing: even as Paul 
going to Damascus, we meet the Lord on the way. 

Hence, though disappointed in the Bridegroom's tarrying, they 
had been greatly blessed, and were prepared for any truth which 
could be found in Scripture, no matter how unpopular with men; or 
the rejection of any doctrine found unscriptural, however popular- 
a very necessary position to be in, to be taught of God. 

Consequently we find them, or among them, some who took a 
more advanced stand than any who preceded them in the 
Reformation work, or cleansing of the Sanctuary of truth. Thus, 
1846-the end of the 2300 days-found a company who not only 
agreed with "The Disciples" in simplicity of church government 
and abolition of all titles; with the Baptists relative to the outward 
form of baptism-immersion; and with Luther in his teachings that 



the Papal system was the "Man of Sin," and the degenerate church, 
the "mother of harlots and abominations;" showing also the 
daughters which had engaged in their mother's crime-adultery 
with the world; but also while recognizing Jesus as both Lord and 
Head over all, and a partaker of the divine nature, proved that the 
incomprehensible doctrine of Trinity, was of Papal decree, and 
without any foundation in Scripture save a part of a paragraph 
interpolated to prove the doctrine-so acknowledged by all 
students. (1 John 5: 7, 8) See New Translation. 

But still another item of the abominable, sanctuary-defiling 
error, did they boldly cast out, viz.: the teaching of Papacy- 
without the slightest Bible proof-that man is by nature immortal. 
That is to say, that, though God can create a man (or an angel), 
when once created, he can never destroy him. Absurd as this 
doctrine may seem, that He who has power to create, cannot 
destroy, it is nevertheless accepted, by nearly all of the church 
nominal, as well as by the world who disbelieve the Bible entirely. 
In fact, it should be easier to believe it, while denying the Bible, 
because it distinctly affirms that God "only hath Immortality," (1 
Tim. 6: 16,) and holds it up as a reward to all who follow Jesus in 
self-sacrifice. (2 Pet. 1:4) 

The wide influence of this last named abomination of error 
cannot be fully appreciated, until we remember that it is the very 
foundation of Papacy's purgatory, and of Protestantism's eternal 
torment; neither of which, find support in Scripture, though the 
translators of the Bible being believers in these doctrines, have 
done what they could to have it support this, the most awful, most 
abominable, most God-dishonoring doctrine, of all which defiled 
the Sanctuary of truth. It contradicted Jehovah exactly; for when 
His Word declared that God "only hath Immortality," it cast the lie 
in his face, and declared that all men possessed it. When he 
declared: "The soul (being) that sinneth, it shall die," the reply of 
this abomination was a repetition of Satan's words, "Ye shall not 
surely die" (Gen. 3:4), but ye must live forever in torment for ye 
are immortal. When Jehovah declared that the broad road leads to 
destruction, this error told God's children: nay, God cannot destroy 
man-it must be understood to mean preserve in torment. 

Jehovah says: "All the wicked (willful transgressors) will He 
destroy" (Psa. 145: 20), but the Devil delights to malign the 
character of God, and deceive "the host" into believing that such 
will be tortured, either by mental or physical pain, endlessly, 
hopelessly, forever and forever; with the heart of the Eternal so 



cold that he enjoys their misery, or the arm of the Omnipotent so 
weak that he cannot destroy them. 

Oh yet, this was the greatest and most abominable of all the 
defilements of the Sanctuary of truth; and since its falsity and its 
lack of Scriptural support have been discovered, it lifts the vail 
which once shrouded so much of God's plan. We see now, that 
death-destruction-was the punishment for sin-eternal, everlasting 
punishment-and it shows us the necessity of the "sin offering' and 
"Day of Atonement" to redeem all mankind from destruction. We 
can now see the great justice of God, and the inflexibility of his 
law, which was executed against the race, not withstanding. He "so 
loved the world." It shows us, too, His love and mercy in making 
ample provision for the recovery and restitution of all who will 
receive it, to perfection and to his fellowship-in this "at-one-menf 
sacrifice, which He provided, "Who redeemeth thy life from 
DESTRUCTION." (Psa. 103: 4) "For ye were redeemed not with 
corruptible things... but with the precious blood (human life) of 
Christ." (1 Pet. 1: 18) 

As the teachings of Luther had been uttered before his day, but 
never amounted to much, so the subject of man's non-immortality 
had been advocated by a few before this cleansing of 1846. One of 
the charges against the reformers of Luther's day, was, that they 
stated that "All which had been said about the immortality of the 
soul was invented by Anti-Christ for the purpose of making the 
Pope's pot boil." The writings of Wm. Tyndale (translator of the 
first Bible published in the English language) show clearly that he 
believed the Bible statement-that God "only hath immortality." 

Of the 95 theses, or propositions of dissent, from the teachings 
of Papacy nailed on the door of the church at Wittenburg, October 
31, 1517-the starting of the Reformation fires-the 27th objection 
was to this doctrine of man's inherent immortality. Those 
propositions having been denounced as heresy by Pope Leo X., 
Luther in his reply (1520) denounces the teachings of 
transubstantiation, man's immortality, and the Pope's claim to be 
the Emperor of the world, king of heaven, and God upon earth, as 
monstrous opinions to be found in the Roman dunghill of 
decretals. 

But nevertheless this item from the Papal dunghill was thought 
too precious to be discarded, and even those called Lutherans 
carefully avoid all reference to his 27th Thesis, and still hold to 
Papacy's teachings, rather than the teachings of God's Word. And 
thus does this like the other daughters, resemble the mother church. 



The Evangelical Alliance of 1846, the exact ending of the 2300 
days, composed of representatives from all the sects, clearly 
defining their belief in man's immortality and adding it as the ninth 
article to the common creed, thus shut out from fellowship all who 
do not hold to this Papal dogma. Thus were separated from others, 
a people who rejected even this last and strongest abominable 
desolating error, which defiled the sanctuary of truth. 

The sanctuary of truth being thus totally cleared of papal and 
pagan rubbish, and cleansed from the defilements which desolated 
it, a way was opened for the replacing of many glorious truths 
which had been misplaced by those errors. 

But strange to say, this last mentioned reformation, seems to 
have closely followed the example of its predecessors. Becoming 
somewhat numerous and seeking less odium, they have settled 
down to the believe that what they first learned was all that could 
be learned. They have rested and have made no progress since. 

But if the rubbish was all cleared out in 1846, the time since 
should be a time for unfolding and developing the glorious plan of 
God, in place of the abominations removed. This work of opening 
up truth and seeing its beauty, is legitimately due now, and is being 
accomplished. We thank God for the privilege, of being engaged 
with others in this blessed work of bringing the golden vessels 
(truths) of the Lord, back from the captivity of "Babylon the 
Great," and replacing them in the Sanctuary; and we offer fraternal 
greetings to all co-laborers in the mine of truth, and members of 
the anointed body. Blessed those servants whom their Lord, when 
he has come, shall find giving meat in due season to the household. 
(Matt. 24: 45, 46 Let scholars critically note Greek text.) 



"We are watching, we are waiting, 
For the bright, prophetic day; 
When the shadows, weary shadows, 
From the world shall roll away. 

"We are watching, we are waiting, 
For the beauteous king of day; 
For the chief est often thousand, 
For the Light, the Truth, the Way. 

"We are waking, for 'tis morning, 
And this beauteous day is dawning, 
We are happy, for 'tis morning, 
See! The shadows flee away. 

Lot He comes! See the King draw near! 
Zion, shout, the Lord is here. " 



CHAPTER IX 



ANOTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE 
DESOLATING OF THE SANCTUARY 



Daniel ii: 31 - 12: 13 

Here the same things already referred to are described in other 
language. Verses 1 to 31 seem to correspond with verses 3 to 8 of 
chapter 8, in describing the changes preceding Papacy. 

Daniel 11: 31-(Young's translation) reads: "And strong ones 
out of him stand up and have polluted the Sanctuary-the 
stronghold- and have turned aside the continual sacrifice and 
appointed the desolating abomination"-the system of Papal error. 
The strong ones here answer to the "horn" or Roman Empire of 
Daniel 8: 9. 

"And such as do wickedly against the covenant [covenant 
breakers] shall he cause to dissemble." [Margin} That is, those 
who were anxious to unite with the world and get Imperial favor, 
did so in opposition to their covenant, which was, in effect, that 



they were to be dead to the world-"love not the world," etc. This 
class was ready to dissemble, or tied to serve both God and 
Mammon, and such were led astray, and became subject to the 
"abomination that made desolate," and defiled the Sanctuary of 
truth. 

"But the people that do know their God shall be strong and do 
exploits; and they that have understanding shall instruct many: yet 
they shall fall by the sword and by flame and by captivity many 
days." (Vss. 32 and 33) 

This shows that through those long years of persecution of 
truth, God never left himself without a witness, and many of them 
sealed their testimony for truth with their lives, for the "harlot" was 
"made drunk with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus." 
(Rev. 17:6) 

"Now, when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little 
help." The Reformation was a little help which kept the truth from 
becoming totally choked out. 

"But many shall cleave to them with flatteries [dissemblingly] 
and some of them of understanding [teachers] shall fall to [thus] try 
them, and to purge, and to make them white." Thus was foretold 
that even when the Reformation movement would commence, 
many would cleave to the old abominations-dissemblingly-and 
would fear to make a bold stand against all of those abominable 
errors-fail to cleanse the sanctuary of truth of all those 
defilements. And further, the trial would be increase by many of 
the great teachers thus falling back into a partial acknowledgment 
of those errors. But the effect of all this is, to make truth all the 
more valuable, that it might be hid from the worldly wise and 
prudent, and revealed unto the babes-the simple-hearted children 
of God. Thus God was separating, purging, and making white, a 
"little flock," while the multitude of His children wee still suffered 
to be deceived because not faithful to their covenant of entire 
consecration. 

The spoiling many days (years) was to continue "till the end of 
the time-for it is yet for an appointed time." Vs. 35, Young) This 
"time appointed," is mentioned repeatedly-It is the 3-1/2 times 
(three and a half symbolic years=1260 years) of Daniel 12: 7, and 
of Rev. 12: 14. The same is referred to as 42 months and "1260 
days" of Rev. 12: 6; and 13: 5; and 11: 3, all of which symbolize 
the period of time (1260 years) during which Papacy had 
persecuting power, and which ended in 1798, when Pope Pius VI, 



was taken a prisoner to Paris (where he died, and a Republic was 
established in Rome-the first government opposed to Papacy 
which was recognized by the people, from the time of Papacy's 
exaltation- -or, when it was "set up." This is confirmed by the 36th 
and succeeding verses: We believe this describes Napoleon's 
career-he who overthrew Papacy (and subsequently restored it 
with some authority, as his agent). Napoleon disregarded the Pope 
(who claimed and was recognized by the people as being "Emperor 
of the world, king of heaven, and God upon earth." He magnified 
himself, and spake, by both word and act, marvelous things against 
this so-called God, or Mighty one of mighty ones-so much so, that 
when he crossed his will, he imprisoned him. (Pope Pius VII was 
also imprisoned by him, for disobedience.) 

Neither did he regard "the desire of women:" At that time many 
sects (churches-women), had been born, and while they were glad 
of his treatment of their Mother-the Church of Rome-and would 
have desired so mighty a one to espouse their respective causes, yet 
he would not; he disregarded the desire of women; nor did he 
regard any God (ruler); he exalted himself as ruler of the world, 
and commanded obedience of all. The only God he recognized was 
the "God protectors" [marginal reading] -the army. He 
acknowledged it, and bestowed many favors upon it and his under 
generals. "Thus he did-in the strong holds-In the countries he 
conquered, he caused his generals to rule. Thus he "divided the 
land for gain"-or made a division of the honor, that was profitable 
to himself. In his conquests he went into Egypt, conquered it, and 
advanced into Palestine, and pitched his palatial tent among those 
time-honored mountains, one battle being fought at Mt. Tabor, 
supposed to be the Mount of the transfiguration o f Jesus. But 
Turkey (king of the south) and England (of the north) pushed at, or 
opposed him- 1798. Finally, he returned to Europe, where his 
career ended and none helped him. (Dan. 11: 45) 

Thus we see that the chain of prophecy reaches down to the 
year 1798-the year of the virtual canceling of Papal power, and 
describes minutely the career of the man who did it—the most 
notable character known to the pages of history. 

THE 1260, 1290, AND 1335 PROPHETIC DAYS 



Daniel heard further that it would be 3-1/2 times (years)=1260 
symbolic days, to the end of these wonders. (Symbolic time allows 
360 days to a year) Then all those things would be finished. It 



would be after Daniel's people the Jews, had been completely 
scattered-tang after, we now know. Dan. 12: 6, 7. This 1260 
reaches back from the end, to 538 A.D., as the time when the 
abomination was "set up"-or brought into power; which agrees 
well with history. 

Thus the 1260 of Daniel and Revelation becomes the key to 
these other mentioned prophetic periods, 1290 and 1335. They 
evidently have a common starting point. 

The 1290 years, from 538, end in 1828. There, we believe, we 
entered what is scripturally termed, "The time of the end"-or the 
period until which, the vision was sealed and hidden, and since 
which, those led of the Spirit are coming to more and more clear 
understanding of these matters. So we read that Daniel inquired, 
"O my Lord, what is the latter end of these?" The angel said "Go, 
Daniel, for hidden and sealed are the things till THE TIME OF 
THE END"... "From the time of the turning aside of the perpetual 
sacrifice, and the giving out of the desolating abomination, are 
days a thousand two hundred and ninety." (Vss. 9, 11) (Until the 
time of the end when the wise shall be able to understand. The 
wicked-those consecrated ones who do not keep their covenant- 
"wicked and slothful servants"-- shall not be able to understand; but 
the wise shall understand. The wicked-those consecrated ones 
who do not keep their covenant-'wicked and slothful servants"- 
shall not be able to understand these things, even in "the time of 
the end." The wise-those keeping their covenant of entire 
consecration-shall understand. [These wise virgins will all 
recognize the Bridegroom's presence, and will go in to the 
marriage, while the foolish virgins will know not of his presence.] 

Verse 22-"0 the blessedness of him who is waiting earnestly 
[watching], and doth come to the days a thousand three hundred 
thirty and five!" [Young's translation] 

The 1335 days, by the same measure, would date from the 
same point, 538, and end with the year 1874. How many of us can 
exclaim in the words of the Angel: "O the blessedness" of those 
living since 1874, who are waiting earnestly- watching- who are 
keeping their consecration covenant, and who may all have 
understanding of the vision? 

Other prophecies and New Testament utterances, show us that 
in 1874 the Lord Jesus became present to gather his jewels, and 
that the time since is called the "Harvest" which 
"is the end of the age" (Matt. 13:39) 



Yes, the light of truth has shown out wonderfully since 1874, 
and is still shining and still there's more to follow. How glad we 
are that we are free from all bondage to human creeds and isms, so 
that we can receive and enjoy the "meat in due season." And we 
would love to see all of God's dear children rejoicing in these 
revelations of his glorious plan, who are yet hindered from seeing 
light in his light, because they are committed solely and only to a 
creed, made from 50 to 1300 years ago; who consequently cannot 
"grow in grace and knowledge," beyond those who formed the 
creeds. 

We walk in the light when we follow our guide, but we only 
truly follow him when walking in the light of his Word. There is no 
other sure, safe light, to follow-'The true light." 

But, not only was a blessing to be upon some of the living, 
when this "harvest" or end of the age should come, in 1874, but 
Daniel was told that his hope lay here. Sometime during this 
"harvest," (which commenced at the end of the 1335 days, and 
which from other prophecies, we learn will last for 40 years, or 
until 1914,) Daniel was to have a resurrection-"Go thou thy way 
till the end [harvest] be, for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at 
the end of the days." (Verse 13) 



CHAPTER X 



THE SANCTUARY TRODDEN DOWN 



REV. 11: 1-2 

Here we have another picture of the same, defiling of the 
citadel of truth, or Holy City. "And there was given to me a reed 
like to a rod [a straight measuring stick], and the messenger stood 
saying, 'Rise and measure the sanctuary of God and the altar, and 
those worshipping in it; and the court that is without the sanctuary 
leave out-and thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to 
the nations, and the holy city [citadel of holy truth] shall they tread 
forty-two months.'" (Rev. 11: 1,2 Young's translation) 

For 42 symbolic months (1260 years), the desolating 
abomination of error, had not only "made void" the word of God 



by false traditions, but by claiming the decrees of the church to be 
infallible, they had measurably abandoned the Bible. Very few 
Bibles were written, and then only in dead languages, vailed- 
hidden from the people. As the next verse pictures it, the two 
witnesses-the Old and New Testaments-were clothed in sackcloth 
(a dead language) for 1260 years. 

This continued in great measure until the end of those 1260 
years- 1798-when the treading down of the word of truth by 
tradition ceased, and there began the organization of almost all the 
Bible Societies, which since then have scattered Bibles like autumn 
leaves, in every land gauge. In that Word of God, thus set free and 
"exalted up to heaven" (Compare Matt. 11:23 and Rev. 11: 12)-to 
the adoration and esteem of all Christians, we believe we have the 
straight measuring rod by which, in this day, we are to measure 
all creeds and doctrines and teachings. This measure is given to 
John, the representative of the last phase of the little flock who will 
be alive in the day of our Lord's presence:— "If I will that he (the 
John class, antitypical) tarry till I come"- John 21: 22. 

The revelation of God's Word, as now made to the John class, 
is a more perfect measure than it ever was before: We have many 
excellent translations, some of them from very ancient 
manuscripts. (The writer has eight translations, which are valuable 
assistants.) And by these, as well as by numbers of valuable helps, 
such as English, Greek and Hebrew Concordances, a more perfect 
understanding of the text can be had, as well as of correlative 
passages, than was ever before possible to either learned or 
unlearned. The injunction to the John class is, "Rise (arouse 
yourselves to an important work, requiring all your effort), 
measure the Sanctuary. Test, try, prove, by the rule given you, the 
sanctuary of truth-the position you occupy as the Lord's "royal 
priesthood." Prove all things, "hold fast that which is good," and 
reject all not up to the measure of your "rod. " 

Not only measure the doctrines in which the church are 
standing, but measure those who worship therein. Let this Word, 
these two witness which the church is now worshipping, be heard. 
Let the Word of God be the only rule of faith, doctrine, teaching 
and also the rule of practice. Oh, how many worship these two 
witnesses in word, and worship in heart the degrees of councils 
and assemblies-the creeds and commandments of men. Whoever 
is on the Lord's side; whoever is on the truth's side; whoever is of 
the John class; to you, the word comes- Arise and shake thyself 
from the dust of the traditions of men. Rise, measure the Sanctuary 



of truth; and every worshipper, let him, measure himself with the 
Golden rod of Divine truth. 

But he was also to measure the ALTAR-and, beloved, we have 
in this little work, been endeavoring to measure it. To the surprise 
of many (joyfully, we hope) we have seen the size of the Altar to 
be a hundred fold longer and broader than we had before supposed. 
Yes, the Altar is so large that on it is being laid during this 
Gospel Age, the burn offering acceptable to Jehovah as the 
RANSOM of the whole world. Yes, once we supposed that Jesus 
had provided only for the "little flock"; but now we find, since the 
golden rod is put into our hands, that "Jesus Christ, by the grace of 
God, tasted death for every man-to be testified in due time," and 
to prove of practical value and benefit to all. Once in our 
ignorance, misguided by the creeds of men, framed in the dark 
ages, we supposed that all probation would cease with this Gospel 
Age-that the "little flock" only would be saved. But now we 
measure it by our Rod, and learn that while yet sinners, God so 
loved the world as to give his only begotten Son to die on their 
behalf 'and as their ransom . 

And by means of the knowledge afforded in measuring the 
Sanctuary and Altar, we have come to "Trust in the living God, 
who is the Savior of all men --especially of them that believe." 
And now, while seeking the great, grand prize of our (believers) 
high calling to the Diving nature, we can rejoice in the love of 
God in the general salvation of mankind, and their restoration to 
the perfection of humanity- -in due time. Oh, the length and 
breadth, the height and depth of the love of God which passeth all 
understanding. 

Again, it was while we were engaged in measuring the Altar, 
that we came to see more fully, what sacrifice is expected of those 
who have consecrated to become followers in the footsteps of 
Jesus. We have covenanted to become dead with Him-living 
sacrifices-if we might be of the Royal Priesthood and reign with 
him, in the Millennial Age of glory to the church and blessing to 
the world. 

"And the court that is without (outside) the Sanctuary leave 
out; and thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to the 
nations." The court class includes believers in general-the nominal 
church; it is not essential that these be measured by this rod. No, 
the nominal church is so wedded to the world-given up to worldly 
ideas, that the measuring rod of God's Word would be foolishness 
to them. When the "Gentile times" are ended, this class will be 



measured, as well as all mankind. (Luke 21: 24) Now, the work is 
to measure the Sanctuary and Altar, and the truly SANCTiFiED-the 
worshippers of truth. Amen. 

"Now the world is full of suffering, 
Sounds of woe fall on my ears, 
Slights of wretchedness and sorrow, 
Fill my eyes with pitying tears. 

"Tis the earth's dark night of weeping, 
Wrong and evil triumph now; 
I can wait, for just before me 
Beams the morning 's roseate glow. 

"I am waiting, hoping, praying 
For Messiah 's glorious reign, 
For I know He '11 rule in justice, 
Right and truth will triumph then, 

Worldly pleasures cannot win me, 
While I wait for that bright day, 
Worldly splendor cannot charm me, 
While its light beams on my way. "

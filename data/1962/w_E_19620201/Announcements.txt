FIELD MINISTRY
By means of the wonderful works of God we come to appreciate Jehovah as the Creator. (Job 37:14) By means of his Word the Bible he teaches us his will, and The Watchtower enables one to read it with understanding. Throughout February Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a one-year subscription for this excellent magazine, with three Bible study booklets, for only $1.
HAS SCIENCE DESTROYED THE BIBLE?
How has the world’s advancement in scientific knowledge affected your view of the Bible? Have you, like some persons, mistakenly concluded that the Bible is automatically outdated? If so, ask yourself honestly: ‘How long has it been since I have actually read the Bible? Why should I become one-sided in a generation so dedicated to broad-mindedness?’ Then make this resolve: to read the Bible in the same modern English in which you read your favorite opinion-forming news journal. Send for the complete Bible, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. Read it. You will be amazed how refreshing and enlightening an experience it will be. Send only $1.

Exchanging Material Food for Spiritual
One of Jehovah’s witnesses received an invitation to attend the Watch Tower Society’s Kingdom Ministry School, the term due to begin before the end of the Watchtower campaign. “I was determined to do all I could to reach my quota of thirty subscriptions for a special pioneer,” this Witness stated. “Because jobs are scarce in the winter, I put into practice the Kingdom Ministry suggestion of exchanging subscriptions for food. On one occasion I exchanged a subscription for fifty cents and a dozen eggs, and another time I asked twenty-five cents and a half-dozen eggs for a six-month subscription. Very often corn meal, potatoes or chickens were exchanged. Before I left on April 11, I worked hard in calling on all promises. Three subscriptions were obtained during my last week, giving me twenty-six subscriptions.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of Jehovah’s witnesses received an invitation to attend the Watch Tower Society’s Kingdom Ministry School, the term due to begin before the end of the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign. “I was determined to do all I could to reach my quota of thirty subscriptions for a special pioneer,” this Witness stated. “Because jobs are scarce in the winter, I put into practice the <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>suggestion of exchanging subscriptions for food. On one occasion I exchanged a subscription for fifty cents and a dozen eggs, and another time I asked twenty-five cents and a half-dozen eggs for a six-month subscription. Very often corn meal, potatoes or chickens were exchanged. Before I left on April 11, I worked hard in calling on all promises. Three subscriptions were obtained during my last week, giving me twenty-six subscriptions.”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
The man who builds to the future following Bible counsel will enjoy peace. (Ps. 37:37) An outstanding aid to Bible study, now published in sixty-two languages and helping millions to build to the future in a proper way, is the Watchtower magazine, a copy of which you have in your hand. During January Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for this journal, with three booklets, for only $1.
CONSIDER GOD’S WORD EACH DAY
Make each day of the new year more enjoyable by considering some portion of God’s Word as part of your routine. One profitable way of doing this is by availing yourself of the “Daily Texts and Comments” published in the 1962 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. A different text each day with a pointed excerpt from The Watchtower of 1961. Read too the stimulating report of preaching done by Jehovah’s witnesses last year. Get the Yearbook for only 50c. Send too for the beautiful and encouraging calendar for 1962. It is 25c.

During January Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for this journal, with three booklets, for only $1.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Make each day of the new year more enjoyable by considering some portion of God’s Word as part of your routine. One profitable way of doing this is by availing yourself of the “Daily Texts and Comments” published in the 1962 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>A different text each day with a pointed excerpt from <em>The Watchtower </em>of 1961. Read too the stimulating report of preaching done by Jehovah’s witnesses last year. Get the <em>Yearbook </em>for only 50c. Send too for the beautiful and encouraging calendar for 1962. It is 25c.</p>

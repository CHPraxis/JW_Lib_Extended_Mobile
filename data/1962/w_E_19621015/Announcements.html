<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Like refreshing dew and copious showers, Jehovah’s witnesses bring refreshment to persons who are of goodwill toward God. This they do by making known the truths of God’s Word. As a part of this work, during October they will feature the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. A year’s subscription for <em>Awake!, </em>with three Bible study booklets, will be offered for $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>TWO MILLION IN ONE YEAR!</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Two million copies of a single edition of the complete Bible—printed and distributed in <em>one short year! </em>That is the amazing record of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>But if you could hold a copy in your own hand, open it and read just a few pages, you would understand why. It is in modern English, printed on thin Bible paper and bound in a gold-embossed green cover. It contains 1,470 pages and a comprehensive concordance with maps and drawings. It is only $1!

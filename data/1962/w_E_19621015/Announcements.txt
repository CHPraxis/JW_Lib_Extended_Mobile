FIELD MINISTRY
Like refreshing dew and copious showers, Jehovah’s witnesses bring refreshment to persons who are of goodwill toward God. This they do by making known the truths of God’s Word. As a part of this work, during October they will feature the Awake! magazine. A year’s subscription for Awake!, with three Bible study booklets, will be offered for $1.
TWO MILLION IN ONE YEAR!
Two million copies of a single edition of the complete Bible—printed and distributed in one short year! That is the amazing record of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. But if you could hold a copy in your own hand, open it and read just a few pages, you would understand why. It is in modern English, printed on thin Bible paper and bound in a gold-embossed green cover. It contains 1,470 pages and a comprehensive concordance with maps and drawings. It is only $1!

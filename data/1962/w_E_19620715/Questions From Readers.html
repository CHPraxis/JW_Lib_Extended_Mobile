<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why does the <em>New World Translation </em>at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:9</strong></a> <strong>read: “Let your name be <em>sanctified,” </em>whereas ever so many other English translations read “Hallowed”?—C. M., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In rendering what is known as the Lord’s Prayer into English, the New World Bible Translation Committee adhered to a principle that was stated in the Foreword of the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, </em>namely, to restrict themselves as far as possible to one English word for each distinct word in the original Greek. The Greek <span id="page448" class="pageNum" data-no="448" data-before-text="448"></span>word here is <em>hagiazo, </em>meaning “to set apart to a sacred use.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The word “sanctified” is to be preferred to the word “hallowed” since it is used far more commonly. Not only that but, except for its use in our Lord’s prayer, <em>hagiazo </em>is always translated “sanctified” by the <em>King James </em>translators as well as the many others that use “hallowed” in this one instance; there are some twenty-five instances of such translation all told. So the <em>New World Translation </em>is only different in this instance because it alone is consistent. Why the <em>King James </em>translators chose to make an exception in the Lord’s Prayer and render <em>hagiazo </em>there “hallowed” we do not know. It may be that they thought it had a more pleasing sound. Certain it is that for the sake of literary effect they repeatedly took liberties, resulting in a beautiful piece of literature, but at the cost of consistency and accuracy. And quite likely others followed their example for the same reason.</p>

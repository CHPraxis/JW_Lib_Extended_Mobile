<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ One of Jehovah’s witnesses tells how he was attracted to the truth by the attitude shown by the Witnesses who visited the place where he worked: “In the barbershop where I work, Jehovah’s witnesses always called and offered me the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I always refused, as I was a fervent Catholic and Spiritualist. One day, however, one of my customers took the magazines, giving a certain amount and refusing the change. The Witness replied that he could not keep the change, and this awakened my curiosity.”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
People of all nations are today uniting under God’s kingdom. These sheeplike persons are serving in unity, publishing the good news of the kingdom of God to all who will hear. During August this will be done by offering people the book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified” on a contribution of 50c.
“LET YOUR NAME BE SANCTIFIED”
Jesus magnified his Father’s name above all else. In fact, the first thing for which he taught us to pray is the sanctifying of God’s name. “Hallowed [or sanctified] be thy name.” Why is such importance attached to this name? What does it mean to “sanctify” God’s name? How will it be done and how will it affect us? Obtain and read the instructive 384-page book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” Send only 50c. You will receive free the booklet God’s Way Is Love.

Bible Destruction
✔ Modern-day Bible destruction by the Roman Catholic Church, such as took place in Colombia in May, 1960, had its counterpart in the Roman world under the Caesars. Regarding a police report written in the fourth century, Time of May 19, 1961, stated: “In A.D. 346, on a police blotter in Cirta, a suburb of Carthage, a Roman police captain entered his report: ‘Raided five homes. Discovered, confiscated and destroyed 38 Christian scrolls.’”

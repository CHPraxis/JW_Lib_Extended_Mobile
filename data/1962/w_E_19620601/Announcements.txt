FIELD MINISTRY
What joy there is in helping other persons to gain knowledge of the Word of God! That is the work that Jehovah’s witnesses will be doing during June as they offer to all persons the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures on the small contribution of $1 and then make return visits on obtainers to aid them in Bible study.
THE BIBLE, A LIVING BOOK
Though written centuries ago, the Bible is far advanced for our age, beyond anything that men could ever produce. Its wisdom comes from God and its teaching sets out principles for successful living in every known society. It is more that just a “best seller.” It is God’s Word to us in the day when God’s will is certain to be done on earth. Do you read it regularly? Get the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. It is a complete Bible with concordance, maps, helpful appendix. Only $1. Send today.

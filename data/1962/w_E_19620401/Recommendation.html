<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Ohio reported the following experience: “One day the department head in the plant where I am employed had this to say to those in my department regarding me: ‘Bill B. . . . is the one and only reliable worker in my department, the only one I can trust.’ Sometime later, after learning I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he had occasion to speak to the men regarding neatness, honesty and the giving of a full day’s work. His closing words were: ‘Perhaps all of you should join Bill B. . . .’s religion and then maybe you would all do better.’”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“One day I received a telephone call from my son’s schoolteacher,” reports one of Jehovah’s witnesses, living in Ohio. “In conversation she stated that she wanted me to come over to the school as soon as possible, as my eight-year-old son ‘was confusing the whole school.’ Upon arriving, I was told that my son was telling his classmates that God’s name is Jehovah. So I explained to the teacher why God had a name, how it is mentioned over 6,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, and concluded by reading to her <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>. Since that time the teacher has asked my son many questions in regard to his Christian beliefs.”</p>

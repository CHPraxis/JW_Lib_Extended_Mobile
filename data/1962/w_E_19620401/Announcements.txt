FIELD MINISTRY
Being aglow with Jehovah’s spirit, lovers of Bible truth are moved to share its message of life with others. (Rom. 12:11) And since The Watchtower has done more than any other journal to help persons to understand the Bible, Jehovah’s witnesses encourage all lovers of Bible truth to read it regularly. During April they will be inviting others to obtain a one-year subscription for it, with three booklets, for only $1.

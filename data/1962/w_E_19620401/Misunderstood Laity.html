<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a talk over the Danish radio a theologian, Prof. K. E. Skydsgaard, made the following remark about the laity of the church: “In my opinion it is a wrong and disastrous understanding which arises from an incorrect view of what the church is. If we do not make progress toward a completely different understanding of these words . . . we will never get out of the stagnant condition we are in. . . . It is the whole congregation which conducts divine services, not just the priest. On Sunday it is the assembly of the people. But from here they should be sent out . . . and in this we see the peoples’ unique apostolate.”—<em>Menighedsrådenes blad, </em>December, 1960.</p>

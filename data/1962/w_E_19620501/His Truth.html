<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The famous Italian scientist and inventor, Alessandro Volta, once said to Silvio Pellico: “I have been very much disturbed on hearing the leading men of science declare that the Gospel and God were good only for the common people. . . . I have deeply considered the Gospel as well as nature. . . . I feel that the Creator is still the friend of miserable man despite his sins. I must live inspired by an intense love for him.” He said: “I have found his truth omnipotent.”—<em>La Bibbia nel giudizio di illustri Italiani, </em>by Augusto Jahier.</p>

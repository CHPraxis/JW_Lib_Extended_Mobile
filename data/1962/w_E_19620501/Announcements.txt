FIELD MINISTRY
In view of the clear information in the Bible concerning our times, there is no need for a person to wonder what his responsibility as a Christian is. Awake to their responsibility, Jehovah’s witnesses will call at homes during May offering the Bible-study aid From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, on a contribution of only 75c.
AROUND THE WORLD WITH “PARADISE”
Literally encircling the earth, the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained is rapidly becoming one of the most popular Bible-study aids ever published. It is now available in over thirty languages, with new translations already under way. One of the many reasons for its outstanding reception is the understandable way in which the Bible’s account of man’s creation, fall from divine favor, way of redemption and hope of life unfolds.

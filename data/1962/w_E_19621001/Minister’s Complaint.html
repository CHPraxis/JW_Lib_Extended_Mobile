<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> After finishing a week in attendance late this spring at a conference of the United Church of Canada, minister J. A. Davidson wrote a column in the Toronto <em>Globe and Mail </em>complaining about “all those pious resolutions.” He noted from discussions with Anglican, Baptist and Presbyterian friends “that in assemblies of their churches the multiplicity of pious resolutions have a similar mind-and-heart-numbing force.” He recommended that “a day or two could be profitably spent in meditation on the dictum of Bishop Stephen Neill: ‘If I were not already a Christian and a churchman, I think that what more than anything else would keep me back from accepting the responsibilities of church membership would be the apparently irredeemable triviality of the churches.’”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Like refreshing dew and copious showers, Jehovah’s witnesses bring refreshment to persons who are of goodwill toward God. This they do by making known the truths of God’s Word. As a part of this work, during October they will feature the Awake! magazine. A year’s subscription for Awake!, with three Bible study booklets, will be offered for $1.
INTRODUCING ANOTHER FRIEND TO YOU
Have you ever read the Awake! magazine? It is a companion to The Watchtower and has a rapidly expanding circle of friends. Its current circulation of 3,600,000 is double what it was only six years ago, and the twenty-five languages in which it appears is almost twice what it was then. Doesn’t that growing popularity suggest that you should look into it too? Send for a year’s subscription. It is only $1. Send now and receive three timely booklets on Bible subjects.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Like refreshing dew and copious showers, Jehovah’s witnesses bring refreshment to persons who are of goodwill toward God. This they do by making known the truths of God’s Word. As a part of this work, during October they will feature the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. A year’s subscription for <em>Awake!, </em>with three Bible study booklets, will be offered for $1.</p>

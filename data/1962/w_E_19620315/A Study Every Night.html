<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“FOUR years ago one of Jehovah’s witnesses called at my door. I took out a subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>and <em>Watchtower </em>magazines, but soon afterward I moved to a new address. When he called again, the Witness must have wondered where I had gone.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Although I didn’t see another Witness until six months ago—three and a half years after I took out the subscriptions—as each year went by I regularly renewed the subscriptions for my precious <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Meanwhile I started a study with my wife and two young children. For three years I studied with them every night of the week except when we had visitors, which was very seldom, and then we would witness to the visitors.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>“The Watchtower </em>of May 15, 1960, had a great effect on my life. The article ‘What Prevents Me from Getting Baptized?’ made me ask myself that question. I decided that there was nothing except that there was not a dedicated Witness to baptize me, and I thought perhaps I needed as much knowledge as Jesus Christ had when he got baptized. I decided though that if I could find a Witness I would ask him to teach me more and then when I knew enough I would ask to get baptized.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“It was nine more months after that <em>Watchtower </em>on baptism came out that a Witness called and found me home one afternoon. I was so happy, and he must have been very surprised when I asked him to come in at once and to teach me more about the Bible. Since then we have had a regular home Bible study, every week. I soon realized that it was not necessary and, in fact, was impossible to have as much knowledge as Jesus did before I could get baptized. The Witness who was studying with me mentioned that there would be an assembly in Salisbury and that there would be a baptism service there. I decided to wait until then—it was only a few months away—to get baptized.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“At last the day came to which I had looked forward so long. How great was my joy to be baptized at last, to symbolize the dedication I had made in my heart when I read that wonderful magazine on baptism last year! Imagine how happy I was, though, to see my loving wife get baptized alongside me in the pool. Truly Jehovah blessed the study I had with her, because here she was as a recommendation of my ministry to her of the wonderful truths in the Bible as revealed to me by the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines and Jehovah’s loving witnesses. We still study regularly every night as a family, and we both look forward to the time when our children become dedicated Witnesses also.</p>

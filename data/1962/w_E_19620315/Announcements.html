<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>MEMORIAL</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Over 1900 years ago the Lord Jesus instituted the memorial of his death. In this simple observance bread without yeast and red wine were used as symbols of his sacrificed body and blood. Directing the annual observance of this memorial celebration, Jesus said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” This year Jehovah’s witnesses and other good-will persons will assemble on Tuesday, April 17, after 6 p.m. Standard Time, to commemorate this event. At each such meeting, following a discourse on the significance of the occasion, the Memorial emblems, the bread and the wine, will be passed, separately, after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each. In conclusion an invitation will he extended to those present to have a share in preaching the Kingdom good news with the congregation. All persons of good will toward Jehovah God are invited and encouraged to attend the Memorial. If you do not know where the nearest Kingdom Hall is located, write the publishers of this magazine for information.</p>

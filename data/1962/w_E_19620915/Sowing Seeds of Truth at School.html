<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>GUEST SPEAKER</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● A young witness of Jehovah in California recently told about an experience he had at a school. One day he met his former American Problems teacher. “Since part of the curriculum is to discuss the different religions in the community, he asked me if I would like to be a guest speaker for Jehovah’s witnesses in his classes. It was to consist of an hour in which I gave a thirty-minute talk about the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, followed by a question-and-answer period. After the talk, the teacher informed me of another teacher who was interested in my talking to his class also. Since he did not come to me, I went to him and offered myself as a speaker for Jehovah’s witnesses. He was very enthusiastic about this offer and we made the arrangements. In each class it was the same, a thirty<em>-</em>minute talk and a lively question period.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THE LOCKED GATE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Texas writes this experience about the time she was a young girl in school: “We lived back in the woods on a farm, and since my father didn’t want people coming to our house, he kept the gate locked. But that locked gate didn’t keep the truth out! In grade school there were several Witness children who took an admirable stand for true worship in the war days; they seemed always to be so kind. Their conduct stood out in contrast to all others. And to this day I thank Jehovah that they witnessed to their playmates.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“One day a ten-year-old girl explained to me about the hope of living on earth forever; her words really seemed to have the ring of truth. All this made an impression on my mind, until finally when I was fifteen years old and my sister was thirteen years old, we both decided at the same time that this must be the truth and said: ‘Let’s become Jehovah’s witnesses.’ So we started studying, but Dad was furious!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Since he hadn’t sent us to high school, we had no way of seeing those Witness children, and he would not let us go to their home; but they wrote us many letters, helping us. We subscribed for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>and ordered many of the books from the Society. Because Dad forbade our going to the meetings or out in the service, we had our own meetings regularly at home, just the two of us, thereby building up much background knowledge. And we did incidental witnessing, mostly by mail.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“It was Dad’s plan to send us both to business school when I became eighteen; so with the hope of eventually getting away from home and to the meetings, we settled down to ‘bide our time’ for three years. Dad spent many hours, many days, trying to get us to turn from the course we had chosen, all to no avail. After leaving home to attend business school, we located a Kingdom Hall, began attending meetings, going in the service. Soon we were baptized. With every step of advancement we took, Dad put forth more frantic effort to get us to stop. About the last time he tried to get us to give it up was when I quit a good-paying job, took up part-time work and began pioneering. Now after 18 years, we are still grateful that those children witnessed to us at school, and that the truth reached us behind that locked gate!”</p>

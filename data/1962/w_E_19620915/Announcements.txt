FIELD MINISTRY
Patience and regularity in the service of Jehovah God are important. (Jas. 5:8) Displaying these qualities, Jehovah’s witnesses will present at the doors during September the fine Bible-study book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” and a booklet, for a contribution of 50c.
DOES BIBLE PROPHECY AFFECT YOUR FUTURE?
Never before in man’s history has the light shown so brightly from God’s Word. Particularly is this true in the field of prophecy, because we are living in the climax of the time of fulfillment of the major prophecies of the Bible, a time when God has foretold that he will make known his name and sanctify it the world over. How is this to be done? What are the prophecies proving that it will be done in our day? What does it mean to you and your future? Read the rewarding book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” Send only 50c. You will receive free the timely booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

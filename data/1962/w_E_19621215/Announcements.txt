FIELD MINISTRY
Faithful service to Jehovah God requires courage. (Ps. 27:14) Throughout December Jehovah’s courageous and faithful witnesses will carry out their ministry by offering the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of $1.
A RACE AGAINST TIME
The end of this system of things is very near, and before it comes the good news of God’s kingdom must reach the ends of the earth. How far has the preaching extended? What are the current results of this greatest of all “advertising” campaigns? Send for the 1963 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It is 50c. Send also for the beautiful 1963 calendar for 25c.

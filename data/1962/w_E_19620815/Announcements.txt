FIELD MINISTRY
People of all nations are today uniting under God’s kingdom. These sheeplike persons are serving in unity, publishing the good news of the kingdom of God to all who will hear. During August this will be done by offering people the book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified” on a contribution of 50c.
ANNUAL MEETING
October 1, the date of the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, falls on Monday this year. At ten o’clock in the forenoon of Monday, October 1, 1962, this annual meeting will be held at the Society’s office located at 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Members will wish to ensure their receiving the regular letters of notice by being certain that the secretary’s office has their present addresses.
Proxies, which will accompany the notices of meeting to be mailed to members, should be returned by them promptly, in order to reach the office of the secretary of the Society not later than September 15. Each member should return his proxy whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not.
DRAW WISDOM FROM YOUR BIBLE
Ever since the Bible was written it has provided the most practical and upbuilding counsel for every activity of life. But drawing from its wellsprings of wisdom unassisted does not always produce the desired results. Have you found it so? You need never have that problem. This magazine you hold is constantly helping hundreds of thousands of persons to walk in God’s standards. Read The Watchtower regularly. For a year’s subscription, send only $1.

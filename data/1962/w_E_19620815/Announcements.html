<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">People of all nations are today uniting under God’s kingdom. These sheeplike persons are serving in unity, publishing the good news of the kingdom of God to all who will hear. During August this will be done by offering people the book <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified” </em>on a contribution of 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ANNUAL MEETING</strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>DRAW WISDOM FROM YOUR BIBLE</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ever since the Bible was written it has provided the most practical and upbuilding counsel for every activity of life. But drawing from its wellsprings of wisdom unassisted does not always produce the desired results. Have you found it so? You need never have that problem. This magazine you hold is constantly helping hundreds of thousands of persons to walk in God’s standards. Read <em>The Watchtower </em>regularly. For a year’s subscription, send only $1.</p>

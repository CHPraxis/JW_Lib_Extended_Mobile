<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ The disciple James wrote: “The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>) Interesting is the observation of historian John Lord in this connection: “The example of the early church would seem to indicate that religion can only spread in a healthy manner by constantly guarding and purifying those who profess it. It would seem that the true mission of the church is to elevate her own members rather than to mingle in scenes which have a corrupting influence.”—<em>The Old Roman World, </em>page 550.</p>

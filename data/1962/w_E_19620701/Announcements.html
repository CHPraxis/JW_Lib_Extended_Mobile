<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Being privileged to dwell in the house of Jehovah God results in innumerable blessings. Jehovah’s witnesses look with appreciation upon that spiritual house, the temple of God, and strive to aid others to appreciate it too. During July this will be done by offering the Bible study aid <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified” </em>to all persons on a contribution of 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>HOW WILL GOD SANCTIFY HIS NAME?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Did you know that God has a Name that belongs to no one else? Did you know that national consequences have resulted from profaning that Name? that its profanation even brought a world’s end? And did you know that God is now taking out of this world a “people for his name”? How you can become one of those who are sanctifying God’s Name today is clearly revealed in the 384-page book <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” </em>Send for your copy today and receive free the booklet <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New.” </em>Send only 50c.</p>

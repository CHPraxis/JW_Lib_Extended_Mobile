<p><span class="font18">S</span><span class="font12">OME people go through life with the attitude of James Edward Oglethorpe, the general who said, “I never forgive.” On the other hand, many agree with the writer named Pope, who said: “To err is human; to forgive, divine.” Whatever your viewpoint, there is much to be said for the wisdom of forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Take the matter of economy. The wise man who extends forgiveness thereby saves the expense of anger, the cost of hate, the price of misery and the waste of time. Is that not a rich return on so small an investment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Forgiveness is also a practical measuring rod. The generosity with which we use it is a true gauge of our depth of ' understanding of our fellowmen and the circumstances that cause them to err. Our willingness to forgive is a measure of our Christian growth and maturity, particularly in the quality of mercy. Who wants to remain a spiritual babe in such matters? To lack understanding and mercy is to be childish and weak.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">The strength to forgive is a tremendous power for good. Its generator is the loving heart. From that Source the power of forgiveness can unite antagonists, promote peace, preserve friendship and heal wounds. Yes, forgiveness is a wonderful medicine. It not only helps to cure the recover, but also benefits the giver by protecting him from the unhealthy spirit of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">human revenge, which so often brings grief.—Rom. 12:17-19,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Practicing forgiveness is always judicious, because it prevents us from misjudging our brother. &quot;For with what judgment you are judging, you will be judged; and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you.” (Matt. 7:2) Yes, generous forgiving is well worth the risk that a pardoned offender may tend to trespass again. All of us offend many times. (Matt. 18:21, 22) Far better is it to err on the side of love than hate. By forgiving freely you avoid making an enemy of one who may still be God’s friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Forgiveness is also a beauty aid to the wise. It brings a smile to the heart and a light to the eyes because of the happiness of giving. That is what fort/wmff means —to give love. When we stop forgiving, we stop loving. What mars beauty quicker than a loveless heart? What is more beautiful than a kind person who reflects God’s ability to “forgive in a large way”? (Isa. 55;7) With each application of mercy the user makes his personality over a little more in the Godlike beauty of holiness. A face that is kind and happy is beautiful to behold. What cosmetic does as much ? Forgiveness is a beauty aid that all can afford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But most important of all, forgiveness causes God to listen to our prayers. That is why Jesus said;</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">“When you stand praying, forgive whatever you have against anyone; in order that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses.&quot;—Mark 11:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To impress us with the vital need to be forgiving, Jesus painted a picture in words: &quot;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man, a king, that wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. When he started to settle them, there was brought in a man who owed him ten thousand talents [about $10,200,000], But because he did not have the means to pay it back, his master ordered him and his wife and his children/ and ail the things he had to be sold and payment to be made. Therefore the slave fell down and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay back everything to you.’ Moved to pity at this, the master of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">that slave </span><span class="font12">let him off and canceled his debt. But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves that was owing him a hundred denarii [$17]; and, grabbing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back whatever you owe.’ Therefore his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will pay you back.’ However, he was not willing, but went off and had him thrown into prison until he should pay back what was owing. When, therefore, his fellow slaves saw the things that had happened, they became very much grieved, and they went and made clear to their master all the things that had happened. Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you, when you entreated me. Ought you not, in turn, to have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I also had mercy on you?’ With that his master, provoked to wrath, delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay back all that was owing. In like manner my heavenly Father will also deal with you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">hearts.&quot;</span><span class="font12">—Matt </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">18:23-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This illustration should remind us that because of our sins God could require us to pay over our lives and every possession. But now that we have entreated God, he has canceled our debt of sin, because of our obeisance and faith in Christ’s ransom. When we consider all the things we have done and for which Jehovah could hold us accountable, what is there that we could demand from our brother for trespassing against us? How can we expect God to forgive us if we do not forgive others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is too bad that General Oglethorpe did not recognize the economy of forgiveness, its usefulness as a measuring rod, its power to create peace and happiness, its ability to heal and beautify, to say nothing of the role it plays in winning God’s favor. Had the general recognized that wisdom and possessed it, he might not have said; “I never forgive.&quot; Nor would his companion have found it necessary to reply; “Then I hope, sir, you never sin.’’ Who can afford to be caught in such a dilemma? You can avoid it by means of the wisdom of forgiveness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">It was with regard to such captives that the prophet Isaiah said: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, for the reason that Jehovah has anointed me to tell good news to the meek ones. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to those taken captive and the wide opening of the eyes even to the prisoners.” (Isa. 61:1) The truth is what opens eyes that have been blinded by traditional falsehoods. It brings liberty to people whose minds are in captivity. This was the liberty that Jesus Christ brought when he circulated among the tradition-bound people of his day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That which Jesus Christ preached was the word of his heavenly Father. It is the truth that brings freedom to those who open their ears to it. On one occasion Jesus prayed to his Father: “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Fear of the Dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Traditional misconceptions about the dead have helped to hold people the world dyer captive to superstitious fears. They imagine that the dead are alive as disembodied spirits or ghosts. This view is held by people in socially advanced lands as well as by those in the socially backward lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Natives in Netherlands New Guinea live in constant terror of their dead ancestors. To frighten the ghosts away, they keep the skulls of their fathers and mothers as constant companions. They sleep with them, fondle them and hang them about their necks. Their superstitious fear of the dead has imprisoned their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Religious doctrines that teach that the dead are alive in a spirit world contribute to this fear of the dead that makes captives of people all over the world. They lock the minds of people in prison houses of spiritual darkness. By exposing the falsehood of such religious doctrines, God’s Word of truth can emancipate those who will listen to it and act on it in faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The truth strips away the dark mystery about the dead by frankly showing that death Is not a doorway to another existence but the doorway to nonexistence. Jesus showed this when he compared death with the unconsciousness of sleep. Speaking about his dead friend Lazarus, he said: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there to awaken him from sleep.” (John 11:11) Here, then, is the hope for the dead: to be awakened from the sleep of death by resurrection. After relating the fatal stoning of the first Christian martyr, Stephen, God’s Word of truth states that “he fell asleep in death.&quot; (Acts 7:60) Hiis comparison assures us that the dead one, like a person who is sleeping, is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">totally</span><span class="font12"> unaware of anything that Is going on about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Man’s Creator, who knows more about life and death than any man, states in his Word that the dead do not know anything. “For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.&quot; (Eccl. 9:5) The tenth verse goes on to say that there “is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.&quot; Sheol is the Hebrew word for the common grave of mankind. Since there is no knowledge, wisdom and work in the realm of the dead, there cannot be any .thoughts among the dead. This is confirmed by Psalm 146:4, which points out that when a person dies and goes back to the ground “in that day his thoughts do perish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By enlightening people with the knowledge that the dead are not alive but are unconscious and unable to do anything good or bad, the truth emancipates them from the fear of the dead. It frees them from the dark prison of religious falsehood and superstitious fear and ushers them into the glorious freedom of spiritual enlightenment It gives the blessed nope that the dead will be brought back to conscious </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">existence by resurrection.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Fear of Men</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">In backward as well as advanced societies fear of men can get such a grip on the minds of people that they become captives to it. In Africa, for example, there is a mortal fear among the common people of sorcerers. When one places a trail of supposedly magic powder around a hut, the person living in the hut becomes petrified with fear. Some persons have been known to die at the sight of it. The same thing has happened when a supposedly magic bone has been pointed at a person by a sorcerer. Despite this great fear of the sorcerer or juju man, these people can be made free by God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thousands of Africans who were once captive to the fear of juju men are now free because of the emancipating power of the truth. Their trust now is in Jehovah God rather than in charms, amulets and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">witch doctors. They live their daily lives </span><span class="font12">in complete freedom from the fear of sorcery. This liberation has meant freedom for them from a prison of superstitious darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In more advanced societies, fear of men can crush liberty of expression and of action by compelling people to conform to what is popular opinion in a community. Fear of what the neighbors will think or what the leaders of the community may say or do prevents some persons from standing firm for right principles. Still others refuse, for the same reason, to embrace the Scriptural truths that would emancipate </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">them from the fear of men. </span><span class="font12">“Trembling at men is what lays a snare, but he that is trusting in Jehovah will be protected.” (Prov. 29:25) The person made free by the truth can courageously hold to what ha knows is right despite adverse opinion in the community and opposition from its leaders. He can say as the apostle Peter did: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.’*—Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Immorality</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Scriptural truth is a transforming power that can bring about great changes in the lives of people who have been enslaved by immoral habits. To persons who have become captive to wrong desires, it provides the means by which they can regain selfcontrol and self-respect. It can break the captive chains of immorality, making it possible for a person to put on a new personality. “You should put away the old' personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but. . . you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.”—Eph. 4:22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After making mention of fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, drunkards and thieves, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians: “That is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean.” (1 Cor, 6:11) The truth of God transformed those people, bringing them freedom from the immoral works of the flesh. As it emancipated them, so it can emancipate people today who are willing to permit it to change their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Hatred and Covetousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God’s truth can emancipate a person even from the hatreds that divide modernday society. Instead of hating people because they are of another race or nationality, the person who permits that truth to transform his mind learns to exercise neighbor love. He follows Jesus' command: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) This leaves no room for hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The person who is liberated from peacedestroying hatreds begins living a much happier and more fruitful life. He learns to exercise love, which can generate a responsive feeling of love toward him from others. By the binding tie of love he becomes united with others who have been transformed by the truth of God’s Word, This truth can also liberate him from the grip of covetousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By permitting the truth to guide a person’s attitude toward material riches, he will not become ensnared by the greedy love for riches. He comes to realize that life and genuine happiness do not come from material possessions. This was pointed out by Jesus: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15) Those who are held captive by covetousness fall into “a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.” (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) The transforming power of the truth can free a person from the captive chains of covetousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are many ways in which a person’s mind can be taken captive and held in prison. God’s truth can set him free if he will permit it to do so. Hundreds of thousands of people already have been emancipated by it. They give thanks to the great Source of truth for making them a free people.—John 8:36.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BY “AWAKE! ’ CORRESPONDENT IN JAPAN</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ugust</span><span class="font12"> 6, 1962, has brought man seventeen years into the nuclear age. It is an age that had a tragic birth, in the blotting out of a great city. Are the future prospects of the nuclear age any brighter? Does it hold hope of an undreamed-of prosperity, or does it forebode even more frightfi^ devastations? Does it bring promise of the emancipation of humankind, or will it mean man’s annihilation? This age of the atom has wonderful potential, and yet the world's news sources carry the gravest warnings. Even before the seventeen-nation Geneva disarmament talks could get under way, they were declaring in big headlines, “Prospects Gloomy.” Philosophers and elder statesmen are likewise pessimistic, as for example Earl Clement Attlee, former British prime minister, who has been reported as saying that it is “but a matter of time until some trigger-happy person will blow the world to bits.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is this an enlightened age? Far from it! Rather, it stands out as striking fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy that “darkness itself will cover the earth, and thick gloom the national groups.” (Isa. 60:2) Wisely used, nuclear power could bring untold benefits to mankind. Instead, it has become the tool of the maddest arms race in history, with an unchristian Christendom and a ruthless communism heaping up enough nuclear armaments to turn this globe into a vast “Hiroshima” many times over. The implications of this nuclear race, and the one bright hope remaining for man on this earth, may well be considered against the background of the first atom-bombed city, Hiroshima itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Hiroshima and Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Today Hiroshima is one of the most beautiful cities in the Orient. Fine bridges again span the many streams of the river delta, and ships, large and small, sally forth into the glistening, island-studded waters of Japan’s Inland Sea. The city has wide streets and spacious boulevards, and the army barracks obliterated by the “bomb” have been replaced by a modern baseball stadium. Fine buildings line the streets, and the new bus terminal is said to be one of the busiest in the world. Hiroshima is the hub of the rich Chukoku District, and with a population of more than 450,000 (100,000 more than at the time of the “bomb”), it is now Japan’s tenth-largest city. Its industrious people have wrought a marvel of reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was springtime of 1962 when I last visited Hiroshima. Before the activity of the evening, there was a free hour to visit Hiroshima’s Peace Museum, The ultramodern building that houses the museum is set in a spacious park near one of the arms of the river delta. It is dedicated to peace, and its gruesome exhibits are calculated to make even the most callous person desire peace at all costs. However, not all is gruesome. There is much else of historical and educational interest in the museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As we climb the stairs to the second-floor exhibition hall, we are confronted with the inscription in Japanese: “Mankind that has received life in this world should above all be happy. But nature has endowed us, not only with happy tranquillity. There are also typhoons, earthquakes, thunder, fire and others to threaten us.” Then the story of fire is told from man’s first use of it, down to the day when it blasted three-fifths of the city of Hiroshima off the face of the earth. An extensive picture gallery includes the scientific “greats” who contributed to the development of atomic power from the time of Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century down to this twentieth century, and including Japan’s own atomic scientist and Nobel Prize winner, Hideki Yukawa. Pity that this tremendous atomic force had to be used first for the destruction of human flesh!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As the exhibition shows on its other side, the peaceful uses of atomic power are many. It can be used for powering ship and plane, and for producing electric power. It can be adapted for producing isotopes needed in medicine, for unearthing the resources of the soil, for increasing farm production, for better gardening, for pest riddance and for preserving foodstuffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, for most visitors, main interest in the museum is to be found in its grim record of the “bomb.” This is dramatized by a miniature movie-style “show,” set to funereal music. It presents first the beautiful Hiroshima, bathed in su</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nligh</span><span class="font12">t, with its rivers and greenery, on that fateful August morning. The plane had dropped its bomb, to parachute into position, and had flown on. Air-raid sirens sounded the “all-clear,” and the people emerged from their shelters to watch the departing plane. It was the last thing they ever did. There came the blast of annihilation, darkness, a mighty rumble—and desolation-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How grim the record! Air turned to flame, and walls turned to dust. Buildings disappeared, or leaned at crazy angles. At eight hundred feet from the epicenter, a human shadow was imprinted on the stone steps of the Sumitomo Bank. The man himself “evaporated”! Empty shells of streetcars and automobiles lay twisted in ruins, their occupants dissolved by the blast. Churches crumbled, and sandstone images of Buddha melted into grotesque shapes. The western sector of the city was turned into a desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those blotted out by the initial blast of the bomb were in a sense fortunate. They were spared the cruel agony of atomic burning, radioactive gassing, and other aftereffects that spelled out, and continue to spell out, painful and lingering death. One of my friends, who lived in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb, wrote down for me the following account of the bomb’s aftermath. I include it here, as it gives some indication of what the nuclear powers are now preparing for humankind, but on a far greater scale. This is her eyewitness account:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Havoc of the “Bomb'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“This was the most fearful experience in my life. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Due to some urgent business, I had to go to Onomichi, and had just left Hiroshima Station by train. Shortly after our departure there was a terrific shock, and it was as though I had been thrown into the air together with the train. When I looked back toward Hiroshima, I saw a huge mushroom-shaped chimney of smoke, awesome in appearance. I shall never forget it. It filled me with an indescribable feeling of horror. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;The next day I tried to return to Hiroshima by another train, but it stopped about sixteen miles out of the city. Here I happened to meet a friend, who took me by truck to a place about five miles out of Hiroshima. Even here everything was still hot! It was different from ordinary heat, and I felt as though a burning stone was pressed against my whole body. In front of me I saw a procession of old people, children, young men and women with bare feet. Their clothing was torn to pieces. Some of them had covered their bodies with torn mosquito nets or towels. Their eyes were fixed, staring, and they walked in deep silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Then I went on into the city. It is terrifying to me even now when !• recall what I saw there. It was utterly beyond description. Those who were still alive were clearing up some of the debris near the station. I remember they were wearing the white uniforms of the navy. As I walked on in the direction of my home, I saw piles of dead people at the parade ground and in the square. Survivors were busily searching among the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">bodies, rolling them over </span><span class="font12">with clublike poles. They were trying to find relatives. The corpses were horribly discolored, like black statues, and no one was bothering to cover their faces any more, as all had become accustomed to the sight of so many dead people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Shivering with the fear that my family might have been among those dead bodies, I hurried toward the place where my house used to stand. There are many rivers in Hiroshima, and as I came to each of these, I found both banks piled high with dead people who had come searching for water in their death agony. I saw several people lying dead with their heads in the water of large water tanks. Along the roads there were blackened corpses still retaining the poses in which they were working at the time the bomb was dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“My house was situated some distance from the bomb center, but when I reached the place, there was nothing to be seen but smoke rising from the embers. I was at a loss, and did not know what to do. Then someone spoke to me. When I looked round, I saw a face swollen as big as a volley ball, and I could not tell who the person was. However, he told me that my family was safe, and that they had taken refuge in the mountain nearby. This news </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">relieved</span><span class="font12"> me a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">little. Except tor my family, </span><span class="font12">all the people in my neighborhood appeared to have inhaled the gas, and their faces were all swollen up. I could not see anyone with normal features. The sight of this terrible destruction filled me at the time with a bitter hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Three days later all the family met at my brother's house, some eight miles out of Hiroshima, How glad we all were to be alive! It was like a dream. However, as we could not forget the agony of the others, we returned to Hiroshima. We placed people who still showed signs of life on our handcart, and pulled it slowly all the eight miles </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to my brother’s home. Every day we </span><span class="font12">made two trips, and tried to nurse these unfortunates. However, we had no medicine. All we could do was to apply red iodine to their wounds, and remove the worms that had hatched on their burns. Yet, these people started dying one after another, and all of them were dead within a week. They died in great agony, and f was terribly sorry for them, as we had no medicine' we could apply to relieve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“As a person who actually experienced that sad and cruel destruction, I have</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">yearned ever since that all humankind would get to loving one another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A &quot;I3omb”-leM New World</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now, however, my friend has more than the desire to see mankind loving one another. She has also the firm hope and confidence that this generation of mankind will see the end of all nuclear madness, and the establishing of eternal peace among a human race united in bonds of true love. How has she come to this conviction? Like many other survivors of the Hiroshima bomb, she has welcomed the visits of Jehovah’s witnesses, has studied the Bible with them, and now she herself is a witness of the Creator and God of mankind. The hatred that she felt at the time of the “bomb&quot; has been replaced by a genuine love for men bf goodwill of every nation and race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On this pleasant spring evening of 1962, we turned our backs on the Peace Museum, with its “chamber of horrors,&quot; and crossed the nearby river to the home that this Witness now occupies, newly built almost directly below the point where the atom bomb burst. Here sixty-five persons attended an enthusiastic meeting of the Hiroshima congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. A number of these were survivors of the &quot;bomb.” However, their minds no longer dwell morbidly on the horrors of that time, nor do they live in terror of a nuclear annihilation of mankind. Their study of the Bible prophecies has brought assurance that soon the Creator of all the universe will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth,” and that the grandest, the most wonderful era of peace lies just ahead for all who learn and obey the will of Jehovah God.—Rev. 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let the hypocritical, unchristian Christendom continue in “darkness,&quot; vying with international Communism in pursuit of the satanlc purpose of stockpiling destruction for humanity! True Christians will have none of this wickedness, for they have already 'beaten swords into plowshares and spears into pruning shears.' &quot;The very glory of Jehovah has shone forth” upon them, and they rejoice to enlighten others concerning the glorious hope of God’s kingdom by Christ. Shortly, the Kingdom will remove the modern-day nuclear madness and its instigators for all time. What wonders will then come to pass, as all the mighty forces in creation are used for man’s blessing and to the eternal praise of the Creator-God, Jehovah!—Isa. 2:4; SO: 1-3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By &quot;Amiel &quot;(omspondent in Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">H</span><span class="font12">AVE you ever walked alone through a grove of tall trees at night when the wind rustled the leaves and the odd dead branch creaked as it swayed back and forth? Almost unconsciously youmayhave suspected hidden eyes watching you, unseen creatures hiding among the boughs. The imaginary sound of a footstep treading the dead leaves behind you would be enough to make you jump. That is the way many people feel around trees, probably due to the direct or indirect influence of superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Tree superstition is rooted in antiquity. The Egyptians firmly believed in a dose affinity between people and trees. To their way of thinking, newborn babies and young trees </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">grew up</span><span class="font12"> together. If one suffered or died, they thought the other would too. Ancient mythological gods even were believed to have turned into trees. The oak tree was especially held sacred by the Greeks and Romans, who associated It with their chief gods, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Zeus and</span><span class="font12"> Jupiter. Daphne the nymph was said to have turned into a laurel tree to escape the advances of Apollo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Druids and the pagan Norsemen leaned heavily on their tree superstitions, especially those involving the ash, oak and the mistletoe. The Norsemen felt that they owed their very existence to the ash. According </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12"> them, the gods </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">breathed </span><span class="font12">soul into the ash tree and it became man. Rock paintings here in Southern Rhodesia reveal a like belief that man sprang from trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is interesting to note that down through the centuries such superstitions have been preserved, added to and spread. In time, superstitions became almost as numerous as the trees themselves, To almost every kind of tree was attributed at least one special power, be it curing, matchmaking, ensuring fertility or what have you,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Fertility</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">The mistletoe was fevered as a sacred and wonder-working plant by the Druids and Norsemen. Because of it good luck and fertility were said to come to humans and calving cows. Even the nuts of certain trees have been a symbol of fertility from the days of the Romans until now. That is why they have been given to newlyweds, supposedly ensuring a fruitful union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certain trees have been looked to by farmers in hope of a blessing for their crops. In parts of Southern Rhodesia invocations are made to the muchacha tree and the baobab tree (locally called </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">muuyu) </span><span class="font12">for fruitful crops. The muchacha or jakata tree has a reed fence built around its trunk and there invocations are accompanied by gifts of grain and water. This consideration is thought to result in plenty of rain and bumper crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In England the apple tree is ceremoniously Invoked for fertile crops in a ritual known as “Apple-Wassailing,” It is carried on in the west of England on Twelfth Night or Old Twelfth Night (January 17). At dusk participants go to the apple orchard armed with guns, kettles, trays and cider. The apples on one tree are picked, the cider is drunk and also poured around the roots of the tree and the lower branches are dipped in the cider. Then the noise begins—to drive away the spirits of bad luck. This ceremony is still carried out, but it is more of an occasion for carousing and revelry than an active superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Strange Cures</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was a time when medical practitioners would have received stiff competition from the healing methods thought to be employed by trees. Suppose you lived in parts of England not so long ago and your child developed a hernia or maybe rickets. Following the superstition of the day, you would take a young unblemished ash sapling and split it. Then at sunrise you would pass your naked child through the split to another person nine times, each time being careful that the child faced the sun. Then the tree (not the child, mind you) must be bound up. Superstition had it that if the tree would heal, the child would too. And if the tree failed to heal, the child would not be cured. Not only that, it was said that if at any time thereafter the tree should die or be cut down, the . child*s ailment would return and cause death. This was just ..</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19620822_files/g_E_19620822-9.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:185pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">one of such superstitions in England’s not too distant past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another one practiced in the last century involved the nettle plant. Did you ever grab hold of one with your bare hand? Stings, does it not? Bu^ what is a sting if a fever can be cured? Well, at least some believed the nettle plant could effect a cure. Superstitious persons said you only had to get someone else to grab a nettle plant, pull it out by the roots and say your name as well as your parents’ at the same time. Result? A stinging hand for him, of course, and—as the story goes—no more fever for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Herefordshire in this very century, an ash tree was plastered with children’s hair for healing purposes. Superstitious mothers placed the hair there with fond hope of curing their children’s doughs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Omens and Charms</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many and strange indeed are the duties lowly trees have been thought to perform. If, for example, an apple blossom appeared in autumn, it was said to be a sure sign of death in the owner’s family. On the other hand, many a Yorkshire miss depended on an apple pip to tell her if her lover was faithful. If the seed burst open when thrown into the fire, the lover was true and therefore still in her good graces. But woe to him if the seed burned quietly away! The maiden viewed this as proof of his evil deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Trees supposedly had a hand in '&quot;‘x romance in other ways too. Who is the maiden who would not like to meet the man she is going to marry? English girls said this was the way to do it: Take the branch of the hawthorn tree on May eve and hang it on a signpost where four lanes meet. Leave it there all night. Next morning </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">find</span><span class="font12"> out into which lane the wind blew it From that direction will come the man of your dreams—according to that ancient superstition. However, they believed that if the wind blew the branch away altogether, one would not marry at all. Another custom was to put the leaf of an ash tree in the left shoe after reciting a poem. Girls believed that the first man they met after that would become their husband. If modern maidens do not believe this, the chances are that their great-grandmothers did when they were girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In parts of England the noble birch tree still has its roots in superstition. Each year on May Day a birch pole is put at the stable door, all decorated with streamers. There it remains for the year supposedly serving a twofold purpose: It is said to protect the horses from disease and misfortune, and its presence is thought to keep the witches from riding the horses during the night and tiring them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At one time in Europe it was believed that possession of the chicory plant, if gathered at noon or midnight on July 25, could make the possessor invisible. It was thought to be helpful in opening locked boxes and doors. The underworld counted on this help, no doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not to be overlooked among tree superstitions is the use of the evergreen at Christmas. Under the heading &quot;Christmas Greenery” we find this in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia of Superstitions:</span><span class="font12"> &quot;The decoration of houses at Christmas with evergreens, the symbols of enduring and renewed life, is a direct descendant of a very ancient preChristian, luck-bringing custom.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Spirits</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font12"> is amazing now widespread some of these tree superstitions have become. The belief that the souls of ancestors live in trees has reached such farflung places as Africa, India, the Philippine Islands, British Columbia and parts of the United States. In Africa offerings are made to the trees in return for favors from the souls of ancestors. In India, where the tree is greatly venerated, many sacrifices, including humans, have been made in an attempt to appease the spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Canada, Ireland, Africa and India all have had—and some still have—special ceremonies when a tree is cut down. In parts of Southern Rhodesia before a large tree is felled the master of the forest is called on to offer a sacrifice to the spirits of his ancestors. Apologies are made to the tree for cutting it down. In India a formal eviction notice is given to the tree to enable the spirits to move elsewhere. Purification ceremonies are also employed. Right up until this century the Indians of British Columbia used to offer a little poem to the sunflower plant before cutting it for food. The hawthorn tree in Ireland could not be cut down without first receiving permission from the &quot;fairies.” In the western United States certain Indians refuse to cut down the cottonwoods because of the protection they supposedly offer. In the Philippines, trees said to be inhabited by ancestral spirits were not, and still are not, cut down. The same applies to certain trees in Africa and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Livinff Superstitions</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While many of these superstitions died out by the end of the last century, that is by no means true of all of them. According to Vernon Brelsford’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Superstitious Survivals</span><span class="font12"> (1958): “The rowan, or mountain ash, Is stiil popularly supposed by the Irish peasants to have a special virtue against the attacks of fairies, witches or malign influences?' This same writer informs us that “in some parts of England the eider-tree is still regarded as a charm against witchcraft’’ and a protection against lightning, fire, and so forth. Beer is still offered'to the baobab tree and other trees in Africa, Healings are still sought In the shade of such trees, after which the trees are not allowed to be cut down. Mischievous spirits are still thought to leave the baobab tree to inhabit humans and make them sick, necessitating ejection by a sorcerer. In India great and mysterious powers are still attributed to trees. Obviously tree superstitions are not dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has been said that there are more superstitions involving the tree than almost any other handiwork of God. This may be due in part to the close tie between trees and man’s existence. From creation onward trees haw tea wsepasaJcAy \w\ked with man’s comfort and well-being. Besides furnishing food and materials for tools and shelter, green trees serve the important purpose of absorbing carbon from the air and replacing it with vital oxygen. From trees come a long list of useful products, such as quinine, cork, rubber, turpentine and many other valuable things. The benefits to man, the towering size of trees as well as their longevity may have Induced superstitious minds to venerate the creation rather than the Creator. But how logical are these superstitions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If trees really had powerful spirits in them, it is unthinkable that lowly man, nature and even pests would lay the trees low. As it is, majestic trees succumb to disease, they are uprooted by storm and flood, destroyed by fire, shriveled by drought, pounded by hail, weighted down, and broken by snow and ice and humbled by the woodman’s ax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The rules of war that God gave his army of people marching into the Promised Land indicated that trees are simply useful things, not creatures with personality: “In case you lay siege to a city many days by fighting against it so as to capture it, you must not ruin its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you should eat from them, and you must not cut them down, tor is the tree ot the held a man to be &quot;besieged by you?”—Deut. 20:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No, a tree is not a man, or a spirit of a dead man. It is a gift to man, something to be appreciated and enjoyed free from superstition. Walk through the woods or forest. See, smell and touch these handsome treasures. Let them fill you with awe and gratitude that God has provided them for you.</span></p>

Notice how clear and polished the window is kept, A dirty window would merit only a passing glance, no matter how well arranged the goods behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In order to enjoy the greatest display of all, one laid out personally by your own Creator, look upward at the starry heavens. The window leading to this magnificent sight is our atmosphere, the air we breathe. How is the window where you live? Clean or dirty? The chances are that if you live in or near a big city, the display is marred by a dirty window, an atmosphere loaded with dust and fumes. The resulting haze not only reduces and distorts the light received from the stars, but it makes viewing more difficult by reflecting the street lights back into your eyes. This is evident in the glow of the night sky around large cities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Ingly by is there for a purpose. It is a silent witness to God’s glory. As a writer of ancient times was moved to exclaim, “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the work of his hands the expanse </span><span class="font12">is telling. There is no speech, and there are no words; no voice on their part is being heard.”—Ps, 19:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why not choose a clear night, preferably moonless, and, if you live in a city, take a short trip into the country, just a few miles out to escape the lights and haze. Choose an open paddock or hilltop as an observation point, then gaze upward. It may be that you will not recognize the sky as the same one you have been used to seeing from your own backyard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If you already live in the country you are more fortunate. You have not so far to travel—only a few yards away from your television set. In any case, it is well worth the effort.</span></p>

How many stars can you see ? Countless, you say? But are they really countless? The stars visible to the unaided eye have been counted by several astronomers who report that they number about 6,000. Now, you can see only a half of the star sphere at one time, because the earth be?creath your feet blocks out the other half. This fact, together with the haze in the atmosphere near the horizon preventing the faint stars there from being seen, reduces the number to no more than 2,000, according to Canadian astronomer C. A. Chant, The eye is a wonderful optical instrument, and we can increase its power by using a good pair of binoculars, say about 7 x 50. These figures indicate a magnification of 7, and front lenses 50 millimeters in diameter, Such an inexpensive instrument will enable you to see at least 100,000 stars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Beauty Unlimited</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do you notice a faint luminous band running across the sky? This is the Milky Way. Choose a bright portion of the Milky Way and look at it through your field glasses. Perhaps you will agree that, using mere words, it is not possible to describe and do justice to the beauty and glory of some of the star clusters you can see. Notice the different-colored stars, some yellow, others orange, some bluish-white and others brilliant white. Known to the ancients by such names as the Winter Street (Swedish), the Ashen Path (Eskimo) and the Silver River (Chinese), it was generally accepted as a glittering road leading to the courts of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The mystery of the nature of the Milky Way was eventually solved by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei. With the invention of the telescope tty a Dutch optician early in the seventeenth century, Galileo, having effected some improvements, directed his instrument to the Milky Way. It was resolved into a multitude of small stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A small refracting telescope with a Si-inch objective lens is a source of continuous pleasure when directed toward the Milky Way. The huge number of stars rendered vrsfdie are, \n tact, suns similar to our own, and all brought into existence by the Creator. Using a little imagination and appreciating a few scientific facts, it is possible to sense the power and infinite wisdom of the great Architect of the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Viewed edge-on from the outside, the Milky Way, our galaxy, looks like a flattened disc with a pronounced central bulge. At right angles to this view it would appear like a giant Catherine wheel with, spiral masses of stars radiating out from the center. It is composed of an estimated 100,000,000,000 stars, one of which is our sun lying well out from the center of the disc. Now, using your opera glasses, take a look at the starry heavens and try to picture 1,000,000 stars in the place of each and every tiny point of light that you can see. This may help to give you some picture of the incredible number of stars in our galaxy—100,000,000,000!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One part of the Tffftky Way that is not clearly visible from Britain and most of the United States is that which passes through the southern constellations of Argo, Crux and Centaurus. Our galaxy is particularly striking in this area and especially around the constellation of Argo, where it comes to a climax of beauty. To an observer at, say the latitude of Melbourne, Australia, this part of the celestial sphere is a rich field for observation, particularly when it is high in the night sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let us look at just a tiny portion near the Southern Crass. An unusually beautiful cluster Is the group N.G.C.3532. While in the field glasses it appears as a lovely starry doud with one orange star near the border, in the telescope it expands into a literal swarm of stars, reminding one of minute rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds on a background of jet-black velvet. “The most brilliant cluster I have ever seen,” said Sir John Herschel, who was one of the first to describe it, over a century ago. In order to absorb and appreciate even a small portion of the heavens such as this cluster, it is necessary to keep on looking at it through the telescope for some minutes. This allows the eye to adjust itself properly and it is really a case of “the longer you look the more you see.” The faintest of stars suddenly become visible and the scene takes on a beauty previously unknown as you forget earthly matters and concentrate solely on this part of the universe billions of miles from where you are standing. Truly you marvel, “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, . . . the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?”—Ps. 8:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An outstanding constellation, the Southern Cross can always be seen on any clear night from a point more than 34 degrees south of the equator. Many world travelers are disappointed on first sighting the Southern Cross—low on the horizon and partly obscured by haze. But later it becomes clear and bright when high in the sky. It is best seen from a latitude as far south as Melbourne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">On Wings of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In this spectacular region of the sky, two bright stars called the “Pointers” act as direction finders for the Southern Cross. The “Pointer” farthest from the “Cross,” Alpha Centauri was, until recently, the nearest known star to our sun. In order to grasp some idea </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font12"> the great distance of this star, let us imagine we can travel at the speed of light. Moving away from the earth, it takes just over one second to reach the moon, almost a quarter of a million miles away. In the time it takes you to eat breakfast, say eight minutes, we reach the sun. Imagine that, just eight minutes to travel 93 million miles! Leaving the sun and heading out into space, a journey of no more than seven hours would take us clear of the nine planets making up our solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now begins a four-year journey into the empty silent reaches of outer space. No matter which direction we choose there is utter loneliness, and yet we are rushing forward at a speed of over 11 million miles every minute, or 186,000 miles each second. Picture yourself traveling at this rate for over four years in order to reach our nearest neighbor, the faint star Proxima Centauri near to Alpha Centauri. In conventional terms Alpha Centauri is about 25,000,000,000,000 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In order to avoid the use of so many zeros in expressing distance, astronomers use a unit of length called the parsec. The parsec measures 19,182,645,000,000 miles, and our sun is about 8,000 parsecs from the center of the galaxy or, if you prefer it, 150,000,000,000,000,000 miles. That is about two-thirds of the distance between the center and the outer edge of the galaxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These distances are so enormous that it is difficult to grasp their significance. Maybe you have seen a piece of finest spider’s thread, not the heavier web the spider weaves as an insect trap, but the fine material used in spinning the cocoon to protect the young. It has been calculated that just one pound of this thread would span 25,000 miles, once around the world. Can you guess how much would be needed to stretch the distance from the sun to our close neighbor star, Alpha Centauri? 500,000 tons! And yet this star Is really quite close, astronomically speaking, slightly over one parsec away. As the psalmist truthfully said to the Creator, “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be . . . Were I to take the wings of the dawn, , . . your right hand would lay hold of me.”—Ps. 139:7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An aptly named part of the Milky Way is the Coalsack. This strange, apparently vacant abyss lies between the Pointers and the Southern Cross. On a fine clear night when the Milky Way is brilliant and the “Cross” high in the heavens, it looks just like a dark hole in the sky, as if the old woman of the nursery rhyme who went to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky cleaned only this one spot. The Coalsack is not a gap in the Milky Way. It is due to great clouds of nonluminous opaque matter, probably dust, placed between us and the shining background of the stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">If</span><span class="font12"> you draw a line from the head to the foot of the Southern Cross and continue it on about seven times as far, you will reach a point near to the star Achernar, easily found because it is the only bright star in this area. The south celestial pole is near the middle of this line and is the point on the celestial sphere around which the southern stars appear to circle on their daily journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Island Universes</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Two of the most wonderful objects in the visible universe lie on either side of this imaginary line and roughly make an equilateral triangle with the south celestial pole. Best seen on a clear moonless night, they look like two small clouds in the sky. The earliest navigators could see them from the Cape of Good Hope, so they were called the Cape Clouds. Later, when the famous explorer Magellan more fully described them, they became known as the Magellanic Clouds. Exactly what are these clouds? When viewed through a powerful telescope they are seen to be composed of myriads of faint stars and today are recognized as objects outside our galaxy. Known as “island universes,” they are the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Up till the twentieth century our galaxy, the Milky Way, was thought to be isolated in space with nothing at all outside it, in fact it was THE UNIVERSE. Now It is accepted that it is only one of hundreds of millions of similar galaxies stretching away into the depths of space. What were thought to be faint stars or nebulosities on the outskirts of our galaxy are now found to be island universes, each containing billions of stars. Remembering that the nearest star is a distance of somewhat over one parsec away, we find the distance of the Magellanic Clouds in the order of 50.00C parsecs. Some galaxies are detected up to the ultimate distance available with the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope, a distance of 1,000 million parsecs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If by some miracle we could transport ourselves this distance into space and then, using the 200-inch Hale or 48-lnch Schmidt telescope, take a photograph of our galaxy with its 100,000 million stars, what would it look like? A faint fuzzy object on our photographic plate. Photographs taken from the earth using these giant telescopes indicate the existence, apart from the stars in our galaxy, of over 100 million of these faint fuzzy objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was established by the famous astronomer E. P. Hubble that these were galaxies, huge independent star systems lying at enormous distances from us. Hubble also showed that they stretch farther and farther into space until they are lost to the view of even that sensitive and eiKjmws searching eye, the Hale telescope. It is amazing to realize that some galaxies are so far distant that, even though they may each contain 100,000 million stars, they nevertheless appear fainter than single stars within our own galaxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Olbers' Paradox</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now that it has been established that the universe is not confined to the Milky Way, but that it stretches out to unprecedented distances and contains innumerable stars, a simple question arises, first propounded by H. Olbers in 1826. Why is the sky dark after the sun disappears well under the horizon? After all, the sun is not a very bright star compared with the billions around us, but holds its place of prominence simply because of its nearness. Other stars give off as much light and heat as the sun, and while they are farther away, there are infinitely more of them. If the universe is uniformly and regularly populated with galaxies and stars, then any pinpoint in the star sphere, as seen from the earth, should be occupied by a star. It is just a matter of traveling far enough away in any one direction and we must strike a star. In fact, we should reach the stage where one star blocks out the light of another. If this were the case, the whole night sky everywhere would be as bright as the disc of the sun, if we take the sun as a typical star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">According to Cambridge astronomer F. Hoyle, the energy pouring in on the earth would then be 6,000 million times greater than that of full sunlight. Obviously we do not receive this amount of light and heat, otherwise we woqld be burned to a crisp. Why not? Because the universe is expanding!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This expansion is on the large scale, not a local one. It does not apply to our galaxy or even to the local group of galaxies surrounding us. But once we consider galaxies at distances involving half a million or more parsecs the situation is somewhat different. The farther away the galaxy, the greater is its speed of movement away from us. The most distant galaxies seen by man are moving away at over 200 million miles an hour. The speeds of these distant objects are so great that the light received here is considerably weakened, and it has been calculated that no light emitted from stars farther than 2,000 million parsecs will ever reach us. We will never see these stars, because they are ^moving away from us faster than the speed of light. So the sky is dark (or dim) at night because the universe expands. Had the universe been created static as far as intergalactic distances are concerned, life would have been impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The universe expands for our good; in i fact, it is curious how everyday common- <sub>: </sub>place things are so closely related to large-scale aspects of the universe. The darkness of the sky at night and the gentleness of starlight are just two examples of the foresight of our loving and all-wise Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Viewing these starry skies through the clean window of the country air and considering the wisdom that they reflect, we cannot help but be impressed with the greatness of Jehovah God, the One who made it all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• Men are constantly learning just how full of interesting things the world is. Every year scientists locate new species of animals that they did not know about before.

Venezuelan men feverishly sift the riverbed deposits in the Gran Sabana, while others, more daring, dive to the murky bottom of the swift River Caroni. East of Mandalay, Burmese men search through limestone gravels. High in the Colombian Andes Indian miners labor in a four-centuries-old mine. But why? These men are pursuing precious stones—diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Men have toiled, fought, thieved, died for centuries in the pursuit of precious stones. Fortunes have been made in a single day. Fifty-six thousand dollars was cleared by one man when he sold a single stone in the rough to a dealer. Always there is the tantalizing prospect that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">today</span><span class="font12"> a stone will be found that will allow the finder to retire—wealthy for life. Others keep searching in an adventurous spirit, for the thrill of wresting from the earth one of her treasures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is nothing wrong in desiring the means with which to live comfortably or in adventuring, pitting one’s brains and stamina against nature to search out the gems secreted in the earth, but—there is the danger of succumbing to greed. Violent crimes have been committed through the centuries over the possession of glittering bits of mineral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pursuit Brings Dangers</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Colombia when four government inspectors and their driver were machine-gunned</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">in effect warning the authorities that they wanted no interference with their illegal operations. Millions of dollars’ worth of the valuable deep green stones has been sold on the black market each year. “Green fever” affects many miners who slip the green gems, hidden between toes and secreted in clothing, past the inspectors. Thus the Colombian government loses much revenue. Emeralds (worth up to $5,000 per carat) being more valuable even than diamonds, greedy men take desperate measures in order to possess them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To stop the stealing of diamonds in South Africa, workers are kept for months at a time in compounds away from their homes and are closely inspected when leaving the mines. In contrast, in Venezuela each man can freely go prospecting in certain areas, taking the risks </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font12"> the profits for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those who dive deep searching for diamonds in riverbeds run grave risks and sometimes lose their lives, as did Mario</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rivas, forty, a Venezuelan diamond hunter who, in April of this year, dived 38 meters (about 125 feet) to the bottom of the dangerous River Caroni. Upon being pulled too rapidly to the surface he died of the scourge of the deep-water diver, &quot;the bends,” nitrogen bubbles having formed in his blood stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the other hand, the huge gem diamond, the President Vargas, was found lying in plain sight. A farmer, while walking up a dry riverbed in Brazil, found the eggsized stone and later sold it for $10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the year-old settlement of Rio Claro in eastern Venezuela, when searching for gems, men live under canvas, sleep in hammocks strung between two trees and bathe in the river, which is also their source for cooking water. Food costs them several times its regular value; medical help is far away. Although miners there may make Bs 8,000 ($2,400) in a morning selling their haul to the diamond buyers who frequent the mining sites, few hang on to their hard-earned cash. Beset by the human parasites who flock to each new mining camp—the gamblers, the depraved women, the saloon operators—most miners exchange all their profits for temporary pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Why Previous?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But why is there such a market for gems? Why do people worldwide desire and wear precious stones? One reason is that precious stones are a marvelous work of the Creator, giving delight to the eye. Many wear jewels for the aesthetic pleasure derived from the use of beautiful articles. Rarity enters in, too, which explains why rubies are worth two to five times as much as diamonds. Some persons enjoy owning something one-of-a-kind or few-of-a-kind; the largest, or the clearest, or the most brilliant, or with the most unusual hue, such as the pigeon’s-blood ruby or the dark-blue diamond. Also, certain gems accent lovely features, the sparkle of the eyes, the sheen of hair, a complexion’s glow, the gleam of teeth. Emeralds on a green-eyed woman are stunning. Rubies suit pale-skinned, black-haired types, and sapphires worn by a blonde set off her attractiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many young girls in North and South America dream of receiving a diamond engagement ring as an expression of love from their future husbands. Another delights to receive an heirloom piece set with gems from her fiance or his family as an indication of her acceptance into her betrothed’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Precious stones are highly valued as gifts. The Turkish sultan Abdul-Hamid bought the notorious &quot;Hope” diamond, a huge stone of a rare deep-blue hue, for a favorite wife. A North American reputedly paid three quarters of a million dollars for a fabulous necklace of ninety-four diamonds set in matched pairs as a gift for his wife. The largest gem diamond ever found in the world, the Cullinan, the size of a man’s fist, was presented to King Edward VII by the Transvaal, South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A quality contributing to the preciousness of a stone is its durability. Diamonds are the hardest natural substance known, although a diamond will shatter if hit in the right spot. Surprisingly, if a diamond is heated hot enough in the presence of air it will simply disappear as carbon dioxide, a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">colorless gas! However, this could </span><span class="font12">take place only in a laboratory under controlled conditions, so it should not preoccupy any diamond owner. The ruby, a medium- to dark-red gem, and the sapphire, a highly colored azure stone, are next in durability. This quality makes the diamond indispensable in industry, the ruby necessary in fine watch movements, and the sapphire useful for long-lasting phonograph needles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another good reason for the continuing demand for precious stones is that they are fairly stable in value, many investing in gems as a form of Insurance. They are portable property that may be handed down from generation to generation without damage from mold or rust or insects. Men and women have bargained for their lives with their jewels where stocks and bonds and cash would have been of small avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Use of Gems and Jewelry</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The use of gems and jewelry is not at all new. It was in the nineteenth century B.C. that the gift of a nose ring and bracelets was made to lovely Rebecca when she was selected to be the wife of Abraham’s son Isaac. And when the Israelites built the tabernacle for worship in the wilderness, they contributed brooches, rings and earrings to be reworked and used in making it beautiful.—Gen. 24:22; Ex. 35:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God himself says that, symbolically speaking, he gave necklaces, bracelets, rings and other ornaments to his faithful people. His own majestic presence he has described in his Word for man in terms of the beauty of gems.—Ezek. 16:11, 12; Rev. 4:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So the use and enjoyment of gems is a right and proper thing. But beware that you do not misuse them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the wearing of jewelry by either men or women becomes a “showy display of one’s means of life,” then it alienates one from God. Gaudily bedecking oneself with jewels to attract attention bespeaks a lack of modesty. And when a woman relies on gems for attractiveness instead of the godly adornment of a quiet and mild spirit, she shows that she lacks discernment. No longer does her jewelry enhance her beauty; it reflects a vain spirit. —1 John 2:15, 16; 1 Pet. 3:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But it is vital to watch our spirit. Gems are beautiful. They are precious. Searching for them can be profitable. Wearing them can be a pleasure. But only a life guided by wisdom from God can win His approval.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font12">£1T THIS very moment rust is sabotaging your home, reducing its value and corroding away your belongings. Like a saboteur it works silently, unobtrusively and usually behind the scenes where it is difficult to observe. It has a gluttonous appetite, devouring the shocking total of some $1,500,000,000 worth of private property every year in the United States alone. Industry suffers an additional $6,000,000,000 annual corrosion loss, to bring just one nation’s estimated rust bill to $7,500,000,000 a year, enough money to build more than 300 huge ball parks the size of famous Yankee Stadium in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This public enemy lurks in the shadows, usually doing its dirty work in dark, damp and humid places, as in the attic, the cellar or beneath your house. It attacks the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">strongest of materials, Iron and steel, and </span><span class="font12">slowly and relentlessly reduces them to powder. In a matter of time, pipes, tools, machinery and other metal objects are returned to the earth from which they came. Undoubtedly you have at some time come to grips with this saboteur and perhaps you felt helpless before its stealthy onslaughts. Many people do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not a few readers will recall being stranded on an isolated country road because the bolts on their auto had rusted so that they could not remove the wheel to change a flat tire. How frustrating! So it can be anytime one has a rust-frozen joint that needs loosing. It is no less disconcerting to find one’s automobile frame rusting through, or to note the reddish-brown or pale-orange blotches that advertise that rust has been attacking the metal lawn furniture, garden tools or farm machinery. Right in the home women often have to contend with rust. Metal containers leave rust stains on the kitchen sink. And come washday, rust in the washtub or on the clotheslines threatens to contaminate the washing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rust constitutes a threat to even life itself. On occasions a mysterious explosion will be traced to leakage of a combustible gas. The culprit responsible for the explosion—-a rusted pipe! So to protect ourselves and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">our property</span><span class="font12"> it is good </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">that we </span><span class="font12">become better acquainted with rust and how it works. Just what is rust and what causes it? Such information will help us to wage a more effective war against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Rust and Its Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rust is a term that in common use is applied only to the corrosion of iron and steel, which develop the familiar reddish or brownish color as they rust. However, corrosion also takes place in other metals, although not all of them produce highly colored corrosion products that call attention to the condition. Aluminum, for example, takes on a chalky white appearance when it corrodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chemical action is responsible for such corrosion of metals. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers defines it as “the destruction of metallic substances by a chemical action.” When nonmetals such as oxygen, sulphur, and so forth, combine with a metal surface, degradation of the metal takes place. Why oxygen combines with metals, with the resultant rust formation, can be better appreciated by considering where and how these metals are obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not all useful metals occur as such in the earth; there are many found in the form of ores. Iron ore is essentially an oxide, a chemical combination of iron and oxygen that has the appearance of earth and stones. The pure iron is obtained from the ore by a smelting process that separates the oxygen. Rust is the process in reverse, when the oxygen again combines with the iron to form iron oxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So rust is basically the turning of the metal back to its original form by chemical action. It has been found that the more difficult it is to separate the iron from its ore the more readily it will return to its natural state. And, on the other hand, iron won with less difficulty, requiring only simple smelting, is more stable, and thus has better corrosion resistance. That is why iron used in early times, which occurred naturally or needed only simple smelting, was so rust resistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore for rust to occur it is necessary that the iron or steel be exposed to oxygen, which makes up 21 percent of every breath of air. It, along with moisture, apparently controls, for the most part, the amount of rust that will form. However, other factors, such as the abrasive effect of wind and dirt, corrosive industrial fumes and the salt spray of the sea, certainly contribute. This was evidenced by a study that was made a few years ago of comparative rust rates in cities in the United States. It revealed that it took less than four years to corrode a standard, uncoated test panel in all major industrial centers. Cities close to the seacoast also had fast rust rates, while in dry climates, as in Tucson, Arizona, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, the rust rate was more than fifteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Corrosion</span><span class="font12"> m </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Water</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although experiments have revealed what conditions will cause rusting to take place, still scientists will admit they do not have an absolute answer as to why metals corrode. An electrochemical reaction is apparently involved, as evidenced by the way metals will corrode when they are placed in proximity in a water solution. It has been found that when metals are placed in water they sponsor electrical currents that promote corrosion. At the point where current flows from, one metal to another a tiny flake of metal is loosened by an electrochemical reaction. It then combines with oxygen in the water to form rust, and if the process is not stopped the entire metal will corrode away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As early as 1824 Sir Humphrey Davy understood this principle of galvanic corrosion and discovered how to combat it in such a way as to keep copper-clad hulls of warships and their fastenings from corroding and dropping off after a few months’ use. He secured zinc plates to the ship’s hull and the current would flow from the zinc, eating it away, and the copper would be preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A corrosion engineer of Dow Chemical explained the principle this way: The “idea is something like the sacrificial goat scheme they used in native villages in India that, were menaced by a tiger. You know, they’d tether a goat at the edge or the village—and the tiger would eat the goat instead of the villager. We provide an electrically active piece of metal we don’t cere about—let it be the goat—and the currents flow from it instead of from the tank, or pipe, or ship we don’t want eaten.&quot;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Combating Ruot</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">To combat rust effectively, remove the Circumstances causing it. Since oxygen and moisture are the main culprits, protect your metallic possessions from them. But to do this will mean searching, for rust works like a saboteur, quietly and usually in hard’to-observe places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For example, moisture on the back of your refrigerator or on the underside of your water pipes may have already invited rust into your home—this condensate is usually caused by the difference in temperature between the warm air outside and the cold water in the pipes. Check rain gutters and downspouts, for they are frequently attacked by rust, as are even the inside of galvanized steel garbage cans, screens and any exposed metal in damp basements or where it is hot and humid. When two dissimilar metals are used in plumbing, corrosion of the weaker metal may result because of the flow of electrical current between them. And remember your automobile. Its underside, radiator and exhaust system are especially vulnerable; Americans spend some $80,000,000 a year just to replace corroded mufflers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rust can often be combated by employing materials that are more rust-resistant. For example, noer-glass awnings and polyethylene garbage cans have proved successful; and stainless steel, an alloy containing chromium and nickel, is highly rust-resistant. Its added expense may be justified by its • rust-free service. When buying or installing new fixtures always check materials in terms of the long-range trouble-free service they will provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The use of rust-preventive coatings is a key line of defense. There are improved ones now available that are much more effective in sealing out moisture and air than conventional paints. It is important to use a coating that will penetrate and fill the smallest apertures of the metal surface and maintain that close adherence under all conditions to which the metal is exposed, otherwise rust is bound to set in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To protect tools or other metal items that are to be stored in damp atmospheres for extended periods industry now uses a special powder or impregnated paper. If tools are slightly rusted, you can clean them thoroughly with a rust remover before storing them. An ordinary machine oil is also a good rust-preventive if carefully applied to all exposed metal surfaces. The lawn mower, farm machinery or other equipment subject to rusting can have its useful life extended by giving it such care when it is riot in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Constant vigilance is necessary to keep your belongings from disintegrating before the stealthy attacks of rust. But it will pay off in money saved, besides giving your belongings a clean, bright appearance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font12">T 1 Corinthians 10:21, 22 we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons ... Or ‘are we inciting Jehovah to jealousy’? We are not stronger than he is, are we?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How is it possible to Incite to jealousy the wholly righteous and unselfish, self-contained God Jehovah? In considering the matter, it should be noted that jealousy is not to be confused with envy. In fact, in some respects envy and jealousy may be said to be opposites. How so? In that envy is a strong emotion caused by the success or prosperity of others, whereas jealousy is a strong emotion regarding what someone himself has lest he lose it. Envy is always bad, but jealousy is not necessarily bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Christian Greek Scriptures the word for envy is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">phthtinos.</span><span class="font12"> In its various forms it occurs ten times and is always given a bad connotation. It is listed as one of “the works of the flesh,” and concerning it Christians are counseled: “Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.” Never do we read of Jehovah God or Jesus Christ as envying anyone. However, envy transformed a certain cherub into Satan the Devil; and in Greek mythology the gods are portrayed as envying the prosperity of humans.—Gal, 5:19, 21, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In contrast to envy, jealousy has both a good and a bad sense. Thus the first definition given by </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s New Inter~ national Dictionary,</span><span class="font12"> Second Edition, for jealous is “exacting exclusive devotion”; and in the Third Edition, “intolerant of rivalry or unfaithfulness.” It means being very watchful over and careful about one’s interests so as to maintain oneself in proper standing. Then, of course, there is the other meaning of jealousy, which Is the most extreme form of selfishness, which makes one very unhappy and suspicious and bitter. It throws one off balance with regard to the one that is the object of one’s affections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Hebrew Scriptures the word for &quot;jealous” is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">qannd</span><span class="font12"> and comes &quot;from the redness or flush by which the face is suffused.” (Gesenius) According to the context the Hebrew noun </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">qintih</span><span class="font12"> may be rendered as &quot;zeal,” “envy,” “jealous (y),” in either a good or a bad sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We find jealousy used In a good sense when Elijah says: “I have been absolutely jealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have left your covenant, your altars they have torn down,” And so also in this good sense we note the words of Jehovah God himself: “You must not prostrate yourself to another god, because Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, he is a jealous God.” (1 Ki. 19:10; Ex.. 34:14) Not that “Jealous” is synonymous with “Jehovah,” but rather that, different from other gods, Jehovah exacts exclusive devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why does Jehovah exact this exclusive devotion? Because it is his due, his right. Were he not to require this of them it would mean that he was denying himself, and he just “cannot deny himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13) Just as a husband has the right to be possessive about the devotion of his wife because he owns her, cares and provides for her and she has entered into marital agreement with him, so also Jehovah, by virtue of his being the Creator, Owner and Provider for his creatures is entitled to their exclusive devotion, and especially if they have dedicated their lives to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But that is not all. Not only is the principle of justice involved, but also that of love. Jehovah God is jealous about our giving him exclusive devotion because he knows that our well-being and happiness, yes, our very lives, depend upon it, even as the happiness and well-being of a wife depend upon her faithfulness to her husband, taking for granted, of course, that she has a good husband. Regarding Jehovah’s jealousy, the Pentateuch edited by J. H. Hertz (Soncino Press) at Exodus 20: 5, has an interesting footnote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The Hebrew root for ‘jealous,’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">kanna, </span><span class="font12">designates the just indignation of one injured; used here of the all-requiting righteousness of God. God desires to be all in all to His children, and claims an exclusive right to their love and obedience. . .. Outside Israel the ancients believed that the more gods the better; the richer the pantheon of a people, the greater its power. It is because the heathen deities were free from ‘jealousy’ and, therefore, tolerant of one another and al] their abominations, that heathenism was spiritually so degrading and morally so devastating.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coming to the Christian Greek Scriptures, we find that the word translated “jealousy” is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">z&amp;ob</span><span class="font12"> in its various forms. It comes from a root meaning “to boil,” as of liquids, or to “glow.” as of solids. Like its Hebrew counterpart </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">qanna,</span><span class="font12"> it has several meanings, although there seems to be no reason for rendering it “envy” as there is a distinctive Greek word for it, pfttftdnos, as we have seen. Depending upon the context, it is rendered “zeal” or &quot;jealousy,” the latter in either a good or a bad sense. It appears at John 2:17, where it is said regarding Jesus: “The zeal [zetos] for your house will eat me up.” Yes, when Jesus noticed all the commerce in the temple area he was righteously indignant</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning the wrong kind of jealousy, based on selfishness, we read: “Love is not jealous [zeZdo].” How can it be, when it “does not look for its own interests”? Further, Christians are counseled: “Let us walk decently, . . . not in strife and jealousy [zeZos].” Fittingly, this kind of jealousy is included in &quot;the works of the flesh.” —1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Rom. 13:13; Gal. 5: 19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Obviously, jealousy based on right principles is the kind meant by Paul when he wrote: “I am jealous over you with a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">godly</span><span class="font12"> jealousy, . . . that I might present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ.” (2 Cor. 11:2) This is the kind of jealousy manifested by Jehovah God, one based on justice and love. Jehovah being entitled to the exclusive devotion of his creatures, and it being essential to their welfare, it arouses him to jealousy for them to divide their devotion with another god, as though there were any other that could be compared to him. “Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah? Who is like you, proving yourself mighty in holiness? The One to be feared with songs of praise, the One doing marvels.” (EX. 15:11) So it is possible, as noted at 1 Corinthians 10:21, 22, to incite God to jealousy by engaging in the worship of Jehovah and at the same time in the worship of demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Interesting as these truths may be, it would be a mistake to content ourselves with merely an intellectual understanding of them. The fact that envy is always condemned in the Scriptures should cause us to avoid it. And since the wrong kind of jealousy works harm, we also want to have nothing to do with it. However, we do want to have the godly jealousy that Elijah and Paul manifested and always respect Jehovah’s right to be jealous, to exact exclusive devotion from us, for we are not stronger than he is.</span></p>

Thus far about 100,000 Italians have won school diplomas by means of the television instruction; last year 45,000 finished the course and 35,000 received diplomas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">What Hope for Unity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; With the approach of the Roman Catholic ecumenical council in October there is much talk of uniting the churches. However, there are many who feel as does Baptist minister W. D. Jackson, who, in his presidential address to the Baptist Union in London, said: “We regard the Roman Church as the enemy of truth. She talks freedom in England, but suppression in Spain. Her financial methods are unworthy of the name of Christ. She has almost canonised bingo. She sprinkles her infants in holy water and dips her parish funds in the unholy water of football pools. In short, we are not going back.” Apparently there is little hope for religious unity in Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Eligible Immigrants</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On his visit to Rome in June Australian Immigration Minister A. R. Downer encouraged unmarried young Italian girls to go to Australia, where, he said, there are 120,000 more young men than women. Already many young Greek girls have immigrated to Australia. On one of a series of charter flights carrying them there, George Gnessoilis, 29, found himself the only male among a bevy of eighty-five girl flight companions. &quot;I don’t know how it happened that I was the only man on the plane,” George said, but “it was a bachelor's nightmare—thrfee days, 21 hours, 40 minutes. Like any bachelor I like girls. But eighty-five of them Was just too much. I only had to look thirsty and six of them ran to get me a drink.*'</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">&amp; On July 6 the United States Navy reported that its- atom-powered submarine, the Triton, had traveled 126,500 miles on just one load of nuclear fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Death Delayed</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Mrs. Ellen Perry had a kidney operation in London in 1937 the doctor evidently left a two-inch surgical needle and thread inside her abdomen. Recently, twenty-five years later, it caused her death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">High-priced Cow</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■$&gt; Six-year-old Elsie was recently purchased by Angelo Agro of Agro Acres farm near Hamilton, Ontario, for $33,000. According to John Powell, an official of the Holstein-Friesian Association of Canada, it was the highest price ever paid for a dairy cow anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Thief Comes Clean</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">According to an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">AP</span><span class="font11"> dispatch from Overton-on-Dee, Wales, when seventeen-year-old Roger Kettle ducked into a local hospital for a shower, he was apprehended and was found guilty by the magistrate of “lafceny of an amount of water and property of the ministry of works” valued at one-halfpenny. The magistrate released him after he had paid the court costs of $2.30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Waiting for Telephones</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; New Zealand, with a population of nearly two and a half million, has 19,000 people on its waiting list for telephones. Two of the country’s largest cities, Auckland and Christchurch, have waiting lists making up 53 percent of the total. Suburban and industrial growth in these districts is making it difficult for the demand to be met. Despite the fact that last year a record number of 68,700 subscribers were supplied with telephones, there is still a demand for 28,000 additional phones every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shark Attacks</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Shark Research Panel of the American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that throughout the world last year there were thirty shark attacks recorded, but, of these, only six were fatal. Most of the attacks occurred in African and Australian waters. Six took place in American waters, with the one fatality being William J. Dandridge, 23, who was killed some diatance from Miami Beach. No attacks were recorded on the West Coast.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Prophecy is one of the most fascinating elements of the Bible, particularly in our day, because so much of it is being fulfilled. If you enjoy reading the exciting experiences of such prophets as Elijah and Elisha, then you will truly enjoy the 384-page book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font12"> because it vividly recounts their outstanding miracles and understandingly portrays their trials and their triumphs, their failings and their outstanding faith. But, best of all, it convincingly reveals the prophetic nature of their very lives and how important it is to us today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The growing tendency toward lack of faith in God is not limited to countries dominated by ungodly Communism. You have no doubt seen evidences of it in your own neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The loss of faith is to be recognized by the increase in juvenile delinquency, the rising tide of materialism, the contagious lack of integrity in political leaders as well as in industry. These conditions and many more are foretold in the Bible as evidence that men will be “having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What can </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font12"> do about it, you say? “From these turn away” is the Bible’s counsel. (Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5.) How? By turning to a regular and systematic study of God’s Word.</span></p>

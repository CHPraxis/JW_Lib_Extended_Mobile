Known by Their Conduct
HIGH SCHOOL student in the city of Maceio, Brazil, noticing Jehovah’s witnesses visiting the homes, became curious to know what message they were bringing to householders. When a Witness called at her neighbor’s house, she went over and asked the Witness to come and explain the message to her parents. The good news of God’s kingdom attracted this student. Soon she began attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and shortly thereafter she was invited to attend a district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. On the first day of the assembly she lost her wallet containing all her money. One of the Witnesses found it and took it to the lost and found department. Later this student was relieved of her distress when her wallet was returned to her intact. Impressed by the honesty, love and unity shown by these Christian witnesses of Jehovah, this student took a firm stand for God’s truth. Three months later she symbolized her dedication to God by water baptism.
At another city in Brazil, one of Jehovah’s witnesses went to a police station for a certain document. While there he could not help but hear a man accusing several persons of having stolen his chickens. The accused persons defended themselves as best they could, denying that they committed the crime of stealing chickens. This led to a confusion of accusations and counteraccusations, in the midst of which someone asked the man why he had not filed a complaint against one of his neighbors who also happened to have chickens of the same kind. The accuser, in the same heated way in which he was arguing, said he would not ask the police to investigate this neighbor of his, “because he’s a true Christian, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and for this reason would never practice such an unworthy act.”

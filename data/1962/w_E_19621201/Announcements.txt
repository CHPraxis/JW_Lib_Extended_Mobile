FIELD MINISTRY
Faithful service to Jehovah God requires courage. (Ps. 27:14) Throughout December Jehovah’s courageous and faithful witnesses will carry out their ministry by offering the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, with a Bible-study booklet, on a contribution of $1.
1963 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
Once more a thrilling year of service activity is ended to Jehovah’s praise. Once more the record of zealous preaching for one year is a matter of permanent record. You will want to review that stimulating record in detail and learn what part each land or island of the sea had in adding to the grand total. After December 15 the 1963 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses containing this report will be available. Obtain your copy for only 50c. Send also for the 1963 calendar, beautifully illustrating the year’s text. It is only 25c.

Tradition versus Scriptures
The nineteenth-century archbishop of Dublin, Richard Whately, acknowledged the weakening effect of human tradition when he said: “Tradition, as held by the Romanists, is subordinate to Scripture and dependent on it, about as some parasite plants are on the tree that supports them. The former cling to the latter, and rest upon it; then gradually overspread it with their own foliage, till, by little and little, they weaken, and then smother it.” (The New Dictionary of Thoughts) No wonder Jesus condemned human tradition when he said: “Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition?”—Matt. 15:3.

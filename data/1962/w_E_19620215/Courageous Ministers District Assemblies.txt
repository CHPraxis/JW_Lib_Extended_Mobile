Courageous Ministers District Assemblies
Now is the time to start making your plans to attend one of the district assemblies being arranged by the Watch Tower Society to be held June through August, 1962. “Courageous Ministers” is the assembly theme, and what an appropriate theme it is in view of the crucial times in which we live! In numerous locations throughout the United States and Canada as well as other lands assemblies will be held, so it will be convenient for just as many as possible to be present.
Each one will be a three-day assembly, with sessions in the afternoon and evening on both Friday and Saturday, and a morning program on Sunday. Saturday morning will be devoted to the field ministry, inviting the public, and on Sunday afternoon, as the climax of the assembly, the public talk will be given, followed in half an hour by the concluding remarks. Arrangements will also be made for a baptism either Saturday or Sunday morning, depending on when facilities are available in each city.
In due time information concerning rooming accommodations, assembly sites, and so forth, will be provided. But right now study the list of assembly dates and cities given here and start making your vacation plans so that you will be present at one of the Courageous Ministers District Assemblies.

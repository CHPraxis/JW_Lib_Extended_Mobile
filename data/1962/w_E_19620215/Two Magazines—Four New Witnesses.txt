Two Magazines—Four New Witnesses
A Venezuelan woman obtained a copy of The Watchtower and Awake! from a Witness going from door to door. She laid them aside and forgot about them. Then one day her husband noticed them among his musical records and read them. He so much appreciated what he read that he at once visited the Society’s branch office and subscribed for both magazines and obtained other Bible study literature. An invitation was given to him to attend a public lecture at the Kingdom Hall, and a few weeks later he came with his wife. He greatly enjoyed the talk and was impressed by the friendliness of the Witnesses.
Arrangements were made with him to have a Bible study in his home. Shortly his two sisters-in-law came from the Canary Islands and joined in the Bible study and in attending the meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Within five months all four were having a share in preaching from house to house. And it all started with two magazines.

MEMORIAL
The annual observance of the memorial of the Lord’s evening meal will occur this year on Tuesday, April 17, sometime after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Each congregation should start making arrangements for this sacred occasion. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant if available and capable, should be assigned to give the discourse.
FIELD MINISTRY
By means of the wonderful works of God we come to appreciate Jehovah as the Creator. (Job 37:14) By means of his Word the Bible he teaches us his will, and The Watchtower enables one to read it with understanding. Throughout February Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a one-year subscription for this excellent magazine, with three booklets, for only $1.
YOUR DESTINY AND THE LORD’S PRAYER
“A name is to be chosen rather than abundant riches,” says a Bible proverb spoken by a wise man who was inspired by God. Little wonder then that Jesus, centuries later in a prayer to God, said: “Let your name be sanctified.” Do you know how and why God will sanctify his name? Do you know how vitally that purpose of God affects your own destiny? Read the 384-page book “Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” Send only 50c.

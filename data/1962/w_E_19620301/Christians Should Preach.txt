Christians Should Preach
The Scriptural obligation for Christians to preach was noted by clergyman P. H. Jøgensen of Kongerslev, Denmark. The priest is, he said, “as are all others in the congregation, apostle, emissary, missionary, but in no way or manner more or less than everyone else in the congregation.” He went on to say that the priest can help, and his theological help “should be such that the congregation becomes much better equipped to go out into the world with its testimony.” In how many churches is that actually done?—Kristeligt Dagblad, September 27, 1960.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“This is a different world. People today are frightened by the memory of concentration camps, by the possibility of atomic war, by the breakdown of old empires and old ways of living and believing. Each person shares the hopes and terrors peculiar to this age, not an age of reason or of enlightenment, but an age of fear and trembling.”—<em>The Atlantic, </em>July, 1961.</p>

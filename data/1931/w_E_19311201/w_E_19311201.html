<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DELIVERING THE TESTIMONY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.”—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S day of judgment is here and his great Judicial Officer, Christ Jesus, is sitting in judgment upon those who are of the house of God and those who profess to be of the house of God, particularly that which is called “organized Christianity’’. The meaning of the words of the above text shows clearly that in this day of judgment Jehovah will have on earth a company which will act in the capacity of witnesses for him; that in so doing they are moved entirely by complete unselfishness; that they must be frank, plain, bold and outspoken in giving their testimony, and that they must do so without fear of man, Satan or any part of Satan’s organization, fearing only God, and that they must Conduct themselves with the poise and dignity befitting their high and favored position. To be a witness at this time is the greatest honor that could be conferred upon any creatures upon earth. Jehovah is not a God of confusion, but is the God of order, and his work must be done orderly. It seems profitable at this time to review the orderly development of his royal organization as set forth in the Scriptures. His kingdom under the great Messiah is the most important part of his creation. Members of that new creation do well to keep in mind the position they occupy and how and why they have been brought into this position. It is certain that the testimony which God committed to Jesus Christ, and which Christ Jesus in turn has committed to the members of his body on earth, must now be delivered and completed before the fall of the enemy organization. It is proper that we have in mind our relationship as the anointed ones of Jehovah God to Jehovah and to his kingdom. The kingdom, which is the great event for which men have looked forward over a period of many centuries, is now come. The kingdom is not coming, but it is here, and we have a great desire to see our proper relationship thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’The Scriptures reveal that Jehovah has a great and universal organization and out from this he is taking and setting into operation the kingdom of Messiah, which is made the chief part or capital of his organization. Those on the earth, and who arc wholly and entirely devoted to God and his kingdom and who have received his anointing, constitute a part of his organization and the representatives of the Lord on the earth. God has set the members in the body of Christ as it pleases him, and we may be sure that he has set the members in the earthly part, of his organization according to his own good pleasure. His people on the earth are instructed to have an organization with leaders or teachers, and these he instructs are to be elected by vote of the company forming his consecrated people. In 1917 a general vote of those claiming to be consecrated to Jehovah God was taken, and certain officers were elected upon whom was conferred the authority and duty to perform certain service in connection with the Lord’s organization. These officers continue by the grace of God to carry on the work assigned to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah, the only true and the Almighty God, is now setting up his kingdom that will rule all the world. For centuries men who have been devoted to God have been looking for this time. The great work is progressing. John the Baptist was the last of the company of prophets taken from amongst men. Prioi' to his day the holy prophets of God, moved by the spirit of Jehovah, prophesied concerning the coming of God’s kingdom by and through which kingdom all the families of the earth shall be blessed. To John the Immerser was granted the great privilege of announcing the presence of Christ Jesus, the long-Iooked-for King. Jesus was a man when he came to the Jordan to outwardly acknowledge his covenant made to do the will of God his Father. He was there brought forth by Jehovah and publicly acknowledged as his Beloved Son in whom he was well pleased. Shortly thereafter Jesus was anointed by Jehovah to be the King of the world. From that time forward he has been and is The Messiah, the anointed King. Before beginning his reign as King, however, he must according to the will of God provide the redemptive price for man. Therefore when Jesus entered his public work John made this announcement: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” The Savior of man then stood upon the earth, and he was also the anointed King whom Jehovah had appointed and anointed to rule the world in righteousness and to bring complete vindication to the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">355</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Before the coming of the Prophet John the Im-merser, the law of God and the prophecies of God were preached to those who would hear, and both the law and the prophets testified to the coming of God’s kingdom. After the coming of John the Immerser the kingdom was announced and preached, because the King was then present. In Luke 16:16 it is written, “The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached.” In Matthew 11:13 it is written: “For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.” The law and the testimony of the prophets were true, and now Jesus had come to fulfil all the law and all the prophecies concerning the kingdom. The privilege granted to John the Immerser to announce the king manifestly made him the greatest of all the prophets. (Matt. 11:11) That great privilege, however, was not so great as that which is conferred upon the remnant which now compose “Jehovah’s witnesses” in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> From the day of Pentecost forward the kingdom of God was preached by those who loved Jehovah. Jesus had repeatedly instructed his disciples concerning the kingdom, but they did not understand and appreciate his meaning until they had received the holy spirit at Pentecost. Then it was that Peter, the apostle to whom Jesus had delivered the keys or privilege of unlocking the truth of and concerning the kingdom to the Jews and later to the Gentiles, stood up and testified to those within his hearing telling them of God’s purpose to establish his kingdom under Christ through which all nations of the earth would have an opportunity to receive his blessing. Standing before that company Peter, under inspiration of the holy spirit, among other things said: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ.” (Acts 2:29-36) Thereafter the faithful followers of Christ Jesus preached Christ and him crucified as the savior of the world, and Christ the great King and his kingdom as the Ruler and Blesser of the world. They continued to preach the coming of that great kingdom. (Acts 28: 31) This was and has been in exact harmony with the prayer which Jesus taught his followers to pray, to wit: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is [done] in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Not only did Jesus emphasize the fact of the establishment of the kingdom of God, but his positive promise was that he would in due time return from heaven and, as the Chief Officer and Head of Jehovah’s organization, he would set up that kingdom, and that then he would receive unto himself those really devoted to God and to Christ. Relying upon that and other like precious promises, the apostles faithfully preached the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom, and this they did until the end of their earthly careers. His coming and his kingdom was the greatest desire of their hearts. This is evidenced by some of their sayings recorded in the Scriptures. To Timothy Paul wrote: “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.” (2 Tim. 4:1,2) Paul knew that his earthly career was about to close, and therefore he wrote to Timothy saying: “But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” (2 Tim. 4: 5-8) For the encouragement of others of like precious faith James wrote these words: ‘Be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.’ (Jas. 5:7) Those who have loved the coming of Christ and his kingdom have continued to preach the truth amidst great opposition, conscious at all times that they were right, and rejoicing in the privilege of being permitted to bear the reproaches that Satan heaps upon all who truly follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ When Jesus was exalted to heaven he was then the King, but Jehovah said to him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1) God directed the writing by the prophets of the prophecies which appeared in the Scriptures, and from this source the apostles knew that Jesus must wait for the Father’s due time to come for his return and for his setting up of his kingdom; and this is proven by the words of Hebrews 10:12,13: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.” Jesus fully understood that he had been commissioned by Jehovah to destroy the enemy Satan and his organization, but this he could not do until God’s due time. Therefore he must wait. This period of waiting must end sometime. The period of waiting for the coming of the King to take his power and begin his reign has been a time of great expectation on the part of those devoted to Jehovah God. Repeatedly they have called each other’s attention to the great prophecy of Jesus himself concerning what would be the outward or visible proof to human eyes of his coming and his kingdom. The faithful ones studying carefully the prophecies and the chronology of the Bible saw that the year 1914 was a marked year, indicating that at that time some great event in connection with the kingdom would come to pass. When, in the autumn season of that year, the nations and the kingdoms of that part of the world called “Christendom” arose against each other in a great war, the faithful ones at once saw the outward or tangible proof that Christ according to his promise and his prophecy had assumed his great office and power as King. (Matt. 24:7,8) It was in that year, 1914, that Jehovah’s prophetic words were fulfilled, to wit: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) God’s prophet then makes record of the words of the great Messiah himself who spoke, saying: “I will [declare] the decree [previously made known to Jesus]: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I [brought thee forth]. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”—Ps. 2:7,8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Up to that time Jehovah had not interfered with Satan’s appearing in heaven, but now the time had come when Satan must get out of heaven. The righteous King was in authority, and Jehovah then said to his mighty officer: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) The rule of Christ Jesus began, and immediately there was a war in heaven which Christ Jesus the righteous King and his angels on one side fought against Satan, the wicked one, and his angels on the other side, and in that battle Satan was defeated and for ever cast out of heaven and down to the earth, even as Jesus had foretold would come to pass. (Rev. 12:7-10) There was war progressing on earth and war in heaven, and it was the beginning of the time of sorrows upon the world, and the time of rejoicing by those who loved the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. It also marked the time of increased sorrow upon the inhabitants of the earth, because Satan since then has desperately attempted to turn all persons away from Jehovah God and gather them together under his command preparatory for the great battle of God Almighty, or Armageddon. It is therefore written: “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. ’ ’—Rev. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> According to the Scriptures the time of judgment of Christ the great Judge must begin three and one-half years from and after the time of his taking his royal power. Jesus had prophesied that he would come for judgment and be accompanied by his holy angels, and that he would appear at the temple of Jehovah for judgment. This judgment, other scriptures show, must begin at the house of God, or with those who have made a covenant to do the will of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) By the testimony of Jesus these consecrated ones were to be and were divided into two companies. One company or part of those in the covenant did not meet the divine requirements and were cast aside by the Lord and designated the ‘ ‘ evil servant”, while another part or company of the consecrated were found faithful and were approved by the judgment of the Lord, and by him made a part of the faithful and true “servant” of Jehovah God. The promise of Jesus was that to this faithful company he would commit all his kingdom interests on the earth, and that this company must keep the commandment of God and deliver the testimony committed to them.—Matt. 24:45-47 ; Rev. 12:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMMANDMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> What news could be so good and bring so much joy to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus as the news that the King had come and had begun his reign? For six thousand years faithful men had waited for that time, and now it has come. “Gospel” means good news. Therefore the commandment specifically given to the faithful “servant” of the Lord applies from and after the year 1918, when he came to his temple; and from that time to this present day these faithful ones have heard and obeyed the command, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) Every one who truly loves God proves that love by joyfully keeping his commandments. And since this commandment is given by the Chief Officer of Jehovah, it is God’s commandment. Every one of the faithful, therefore, must have a part in the preaching of the good news or gospel that the King has come and that his reign has begun. There is a specific reason why this message must be preached to the people. According to the words of Jesus it is being done as a witness to the nations, but not for the purpose or with the expectation of converting all the nations now. Jesus then adds, that, when this work of bearing testimony to the people is done, then there shall immediately follow the greatest trouble that has ever been or ever will be again upon the world. That great trouble is Armageddon, which will completely wreck Satan and Satan’s entire organization.—Matt. 24:21,22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The kingdom that henceforth shall rule the world is Jehovah God’s kingdom, because God is the Author thereof; and it will vindicate his name and prove Jehovah to be the only true and Almighty God. It is also called “the kingdom of heaven”, because the seat of government is in heaven. It is also called “the kingdom of Christ”, because Christ Jesus is the great and mighty Ruler or King who demonstrates the judgment and decrees of Jehovah God and carries out his purposes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“The great question at issue since the days of Eden has been and is, Who is the Supreme One and whose will shall be done amongst men? Satan the wicked one voluntarily assumed that high position in defiance of Jehovah God. He challenged Jehovah God, declaring that God could not put men on earth who would be faithful and true to him under great stress. That the name of Jehovah God might be for ever vindicated Jehovah first gave Satan the full opportunity to prove his contention, and then he declares that his purpose is to destroy Satan and his organization and thus convince all creation that Jehovah is the Almighty, the Supreme One. During the period of the Christian era Satan has obtained control of the organization called “organized Christianity”, and the teachers and the leaders therein Satan has induced to deny the Bible testimony concerning the creation of man as perfect, the fall of man by reason of sin, the redemption of man by the blood of Christ Jesus, and the kingdom of God as the one and only hope for the uplift and blessing of the nations and peoples of the world. Jehovah declares his purpose to bring the whole matter to a final and conclusive issue. He therefore says by his prophet: “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who among them can declare this and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.” (Isa. 43: 9) Satan and his rep-i’esentatives in the nations are now challenged to bring forth their witnesses and prove their contention, or else admit that Satan is the great liar and that God’s Word alone is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ Who will speak in the name of Jehovah God and faithfully bear testimony in his name? That Jehovah will have witnesses who do speak in his name there cannot be the least doubt, because he says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have, shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” This scripture is fully supported by the prophecy uttered by Jesus concerning the testimony that must be given as a witness to the nations, and which must be given by his faithful followers who were made a part of the temple class; and therefore Jesus identifies these his faithful followers and the one whom he calls his “faithful and wise servant” as the ones who shall bear this testimony to the name of Jehovah God. As Jesus declares that the completion of this testimony shall be followed by the great time of trouble known as Armageddon, even so the same prophet of Jehovah says: “Thus saith [Jehovah], your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel [God’s chosen people]; For your sake I have sent to Babylon [ Satan’s organization ], and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans [Satan’s representatives], whose cry is in the ships. I am the Lord, your Holy One, the creator of Israel [God’s chosen people], your King. Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; They [those composing Satan’s organization] shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.” (Isa. 43:14-17) Thus the Lord shows that he will completely clean out the Devil’s crowd when the testimony by Jehovah’s witnesses has been completed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Christ Jesus is the great Servant of Jehovah God, and the faithful followers of Christ upon the earth at his coming and his kingdom constitute what the Scriptures call ‘the feet of him that brings good tidings and publishes peace’. (Isa. 52:7) These faithful ones are upon the mount of God, Mount Zion, because they have been gathered into God's organization and made a part thereof, and these are following the leadership of Christ Jesus the King. (Rev. 14; 1, 2) Jehovah God has constituted Christ Jesus and his body members as his instrument for the opening of the blind eyes of the people, that the prisoners in Satan’s organization may be released, and that others of good will may get their eyes open. (Isa. 42: 6,7) “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.”—Isa. 55:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> Acting by and through his beloved Son and Chief Executive Officer, Jehovah God has risen up to make an end of lawlessness; but before dashing to pieces the wicked one and his organization he sends forth his witnesses to give warning to Satan’s representatives in Christendom. (Ezck. 3: 5-11) For the comfort and encouragement of those who now have boldness to serve God and to speak forth his name in this day of judgment Jehovah says: “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. And the nations shall seo thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. ’ ’—Isa. 62:1, 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ll.</span><span class="font3"> V.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Heretofore God’s faithful people have been known by divers names, but the time has come when the mouth of Jehovah gives to his people a new name, that there can be no misunderstanding as to whom they represent. To his faithful witnesses who keep his commandments and bear the testimony of Jesus Christ, Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” Therefore the name bestowed upon his faithful ones is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Often Jehovah has used his devoted people to fulfil certain portions of his prophecies, and then later revealed to them that they have been so used. It was in 1918 that the Lord Jesus began judgment at the temple of God. From that time forward the approved ones were brought into the temple and made the witnesses of Jehovah. It was at that time that the new name was given by Jehovah to his anointed ones, and all those who have been brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness have received that name, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” It was not until 1931, however, that Jehovah God made known to his people that he had thus named them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Those who have willingly and joyfully received this new name given by Jehovah have taken upon themselves a solemn responsibility. When the Israelites stood before Mount Sinai, and Jehovah spoke his covenant to them by the mouth of Moses, the people there with one accord said: ‘ ‘ All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” (Ex. 19:8) The people there took upon themselves a great responsibility. They had an opportunity to be faithful to their covenant. So likewise when God’s people stood in his presence and said, “We give our vote knowingly and gladly to receive the new name which the mouth of Jehovah God has given us,” thereby all such assumed a grave responsibility before God and each and every one has now the opportunity to prove faithfulness to that name. So likewise every company of anointed ones of God who subsequently adopt or have adopted a like resolution have assumed a like responsibility. This responsibility means that all such, in order to be faithful to God, must faithfully bear testimony to the nations according to God’s commandment. That responsibility cannot be fulfilled by merely developing what is called “character”, and by living a quiet, pure and pious life. It calls for much more than that. It demands of all such who take the name that they use their best endeavors to carry the testimony of warning and of comfort to the people according to the commandment of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Faithfulness by Jehovah’s witnesses in giving the testimony as commanded causes the enemy Satan to concentrate his fire upon God’s witnesses. These are the only ones on earth who really expose Satan and his wicked organization, and who enlighten the people concerning the righteousness of God and his Kingdom, and for this reason Satan goes forth to make war against them. (Lev. 12:17) The most subtle instrument he uses in this warfare is the “man of sin” and the clergy of “organized Christianity”, so called. Those clergymen who are apparently pious and pose as representatives of Jehovah God fraudulently induce the officers of the law to believe that they are God’s representatives on earth. They tell the officers of the law that the men and women who are going from place to place with the message of God’s kingdom are enemies of the government acting under the cloak of religion, that they are seditionists and should be apprehended and punished. By this false and fraudulent means they induce the officers of the law to cause the arrest, trial and imprisonment of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> This is exactly true to the prophecy uttered by Jesus and other of the prophets, and should therefore be of real encouragement to Jehovah’s witnesses. God has commanded them to go through the gates or entrances into the kingdom, and to remove the stumbling stones and lift up God’s standard for the people. (Isa. 62:10) To that extent they are made leaders of the people. They are thus entering into the kingdom through much tribulation, even as it was prophetically written long ago.—Acts 14: 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SOCIETY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Does the adoption of the new name mean that we have abandoned the name and title “Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society”? What is our true relationship to “the Society”? As our Lord and Master Christ Jesus when on earth was in the world, but no part of it, and as he commanded those of his followers to obey the laws of man which did not conflict with the laws of God, even so it is with the members of the body of Christ on earth that go to make up “Jehovah’s witnesses” now. (Matt. 22:21) There are two ways by which a company of people may collectively hold title to property, to wit: (a) By one or more persons holding title in trust for the entire company, and (b) by a company forming a body corporate or corporation. The latter is the more convenient, because a body corporate is considered as having a perpetual existence, and there is no necessity for the changing of trustees. Some who claim to serve the Lord have foolishly said that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a man-made organization operated by and under the authority of the Devil’s organization. Such claim is entirely unreasonable and even worse than foolish. Men have not organized governments in order to serve the Devil. They have not even known that the Devil has any power over governments. The purpose of the early settlers of America was to establish a government where they might dwell in peace and worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. The state and national governments were organized ■with a view of bettering the human conditions. Through false religious leaders the Devil quickly got control over the rulers, but he did so without their knowledge and because they did not wholly submit themselves to Jehovah God. There must be law and order among any people that expect to get on decently, and the laws of the land were enacted for a good purpose. There are millions of people in this land who are no part of Satan’s organization, but they are under it because they cannot help themselves. The true followers of Christ Jesus living in this land are in Satan’s world, but are no part of Satan’s organization. It is entirely in harmony with the will of God that these should obey all regulations of the land which regulations or laws do not contravene God’s law.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> The company of God’s consecrated people in this land had formed themselves into an organization or company some time prior to 1884. In that year it was deemed for the best interests of the work of preaching the gospel that a corporation be formed. The result was that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was formed and organized under the provisions of the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and for the purpose of preaching the gospel, as its charter sets forth: * ‘ The purpose for which the corporation is formed is, the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The name “Society”, therefore, properly applied then and now to the collective body of consecrated followers of Christ Jesus who are interested in his kingdom. The corporate body, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, is the instrument of the company of God’s people to carry on their work. Because it is organized under the laws of the land does not at all mean that it operates by authority of Satan’s organization. If Satan could have prevented the formation of the “Society” and its incorporation we may be sure he would have done so. For anyone to say, then, that the “Society” is operating by authority of Satan’s organization is a wicked statement. The proper relationship of the “Society”, composed of God’s anointed people now on earth, to the corporation, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, is that the body of people who go to make up Jehovah’s “servant” or witnesses is properly called the “Society”, and the corporation is the servant or instrument of this company of anointed people by which they carry on a part of their work. It was organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, but operates throughout the world. In 1S09 the “Society”, to wit, God’s consecrated people, decided to move the operating headquarters from Pennsylvania to New York state; and in order to meet the conditions and enable this company to carry on its work in an orderly way, the Peoples Pulpit Association was incorporated and organized under the Membership Corporation Act of the State of New York, and it works together and in harmony with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. What is said about the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is also true of and concerning the Peoples Pulpit Association, to wit: It is the servant or instrument of the “Society”, God’s consecrated and anointed people, to carry on the kingdom work in an orderly way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> Latei' a similar corporation was organized under the laws of England, and under the corporate name of International Bible Students Association. Likewise that corporation is merely the servant or instrument of the “Society”, or company of God’s anointed people, to carry on the kingdom work in an orderly manner. None of these corporations receives any authority from Satan, but all of them are deadly opponents of Satan, and the only ones that Satan is now making war against.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Desiring to keep entirely aloof from denominational church organizations, and not being a sect or cult, the “Society”, or God’s consecrated people, adopted no specific name, but generally applied to themselves the name of International Bible Students Association because they were and are students of the Bible and servants of the Lord. Others called them “Millennial Dawnists”, “Russellites,” “Watch Tower Bible people, ’ ’ and even other names.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> In 1918, when the Lord came to Jehovah’s temple and began judgment, the approved servants were taken into the temple and under the robe of righteousness and became a part of the elect “servant”, which is the anointed, the Christ of Jehovah. Then it was that Jehovah gave to this company a new name, which now they have come to know, and which they joyfully take, and which name is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. The mouth of the Lord has thus named them. That docs not at all mean that these have cast away the corporate body which constitutes the servant or instrument used to do their work. They continue to use these corporations as heretofore and for the purpose for which they were organized.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TEE WATCHTOWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> Jehovah God, by and through Christ Jesus and his appointed servants, teaches his people. The light and truth belongs to God. This journal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> is one of the means used by the Lord amongst men to teach his people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is controlled by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. The Board of Directors, seeing no Scriptural or other reason why an Editorial Committee should exist or appear in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> by resolution abolished the Editorial Committee. In the place and stead of the Editorial Committee you will observe there appears this text: “And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah ; and great shall be the peace of thy children. ’ ’ (Isa. 54:13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> A new cover has been adopted for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which is fully supported by the Scriptures. The purpose is to use everything in connection with the Society to give testimony to the honor and praise of Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">QUALIFICATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> The Scriptural qualifications to be had by Jehovah’s witnesses are these: Full and complete consecration to do the will of God, and then doing his will; begotten of God, called to the kingdom, responding to the call, chosen and approved for faithfulness, and brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness. Such then become the children of God by Zion. Of such, full obedience to the commandments of the Lord God is required so far as it lies within us to obey. Such must be completely devoted to God and then do with his might what his hands find to do, that is, in accord with Jehovah’s expressed will. It is not for any man or body of men to arbitrarily determine just who are Jehovah’s witnesses, but each one must determine for himself whether or not he is Jehovah’s witness, basing his conclusion upon the witness of the holy spirit and his action in harmony therewith. Many may say that they are witnesses of Jehovah, but words count for nothing unless the course of action taken by such proves full devotion to God and his kingdom. This is proven by the creature’s taking and pursuing a course of action without compromise and wholly on the side of God and his kingdom. As it is written: ‘Be ye holy, because God is holy. ’ All of the approved ones of God must be wholly devoted to his cause, and must refuse to have any interest in, share or sympathy with Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The fact that Jehovah has designated a class as his witnesses is proof conclusive that these must bear testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God. In doing this these witnesses will employ and continue to employ such means as God has provided for them to use. Among these provisions are the three corporations above named, printing presses, bookmaking machines, the radio, and other associated means of making known to the peoples of the world that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here. While it is necessary to purchase machines and other material from those who are of the Devil’s organization, that doesn’t at all make those machines or other material any part of Satan’s organization; and it would be worse than foolish to say that the ‘ ‘ Society ’ ’ is using any of these instruments by the authority or will of Satan’s organization. Jehovah God is the Author and Creator of all material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses must with patience continue the good fight, giving the testimony with boldness even to the end. “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Rev. 14:12) This shows a test of God’s people; and the test is now on, and it will continue until the end. The line of demarkation is clearly drawn. Jehovah’s witnesses arc they who are to take the lead on his side and who refuse to worship or have anything to do with the Devil’s organization. It is the time of crisis, because it is the day of judgment and the time that the saints must have boldness for the Lord in declaring his message of truth. Let no one be foolish or unwise or attempt to get himself into the position of a martyr. Bear in mind that you represent the God of eternity and his kingdom, and that you have the backing of all power of the universe; and we can be assured of this, if we are wise and faithful to our covenant. In this connection it is the ones that are faithful unto death that receive the great reward. These must maintain their integrity and devotion unto God and his kingdom.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>UNITED PUBLICITY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S witnesses constitute the publicity agents of God’s kingdom on earth. To these the Lord has committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and they joyfully obey the commandments of Jehovah. The word or message is Jehovah’s, and his loving-kindness toward his little band of witnesses has made them great. Therefore it is written that Jehovah gives the word and great is the company that publishes it. This company is not great in numbers nor great in power within itself, but it is great in the favor and in the strength of Jehovah God. Necessarily the members of the company must be united, because all are begotten of one spirit, all are called in one hope of their calling to the kingdom, all are chosen and anointed, and all are made members of the company of Jehovah’s witnesses. There can be no division in that company. There must of necessity be unity in their action, and their action is and must be the publication of the name of Jehovah, of his King, and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society now publishes the kingdom message in more than thirty-five different languages, and this message is being delivered to the nations of the world as a witness and which work is being done in obedience to the commandment of the Lord. This commandment, as he clearly stated, must be obeyed immediately following the World War. (Matt. 24:14) Although these witnesses speak different tongues, they are all singing one and the same song. In complete unity and harmony they lift up the voice and sing. We are now in that day in which Jehovah God has made known to his people the meaning of his name and of his purposes, and those who compose the faithful remnant rejoice that Jehovah has selected them and has told them to go forward and make known to others that he is the Supreme One and that his due time is at hand when he will vindicate his name before all creation. Agreeable to the words of the prophet all of the anointed ones now see eye to eye; that is to say, they understand the beauty and harmony of God’s purposes as expressed in his Word. Seeing this they break forth in song together. A “song” means harmonious sounds proclaimed to the praise of the Creator. A discordant sound or sounds the Scriptures designate as “noise”. All who do not work together harmoniously to the glory of God and in unity in declaring the kingdom message are merely making a noise. All of the temple class now on earth lift up or raise the message of praise to Jehovah’s name in one grand, harmonious song. This is one of the means by which all the members are identified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The church has come to that blessed unity mentioned by the apostle. Christ Jesus is at his temple and has gathered his own unto himself. The remnant, realizing this, are engaged in carrying forward his message according to his will. That the best results may be accomplished during the year, and to the glory of the Lord, arrangement is made for a united testimony work. The testimony of each and every witness will be one and the same, even though they will be speaking different tongues. They will speak not their own words, but the message of the kingdom calling attention to the things that God would have the people to know at this time. To this end the Society has arranged a number of conventions during the year, a list of which appears below. Each one of these conventions will be under the supervision of the Society. The chairman will be named by the Society, and programs made out by it. The regional director appointed by the Society will direct the field work. Each one of these service conventions will open on Friday evening. At that time the chairman or some one under his direction will give instructions concerning the work in the field for the days following. The forenoon and until 2:30 in the afternoon Saturday will be devoted to the field service. At 3: 30 Saturday afternoon there will be an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and some speaker will be assigned to talk, who will use an up-to-date article that appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Sunday the field service will be had in the forenoon and afternoon in the same way, and will be followed by a meeting in the afternoon and evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The speakers will be glad to discuss up-to-date truths that appear in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the books, for the reason that this will enable the brethren who compose Jehovah’s witnesses to keep abreast with the truth that the Lord is giving to his people and to know his will concerning them. All realize that it is the greatest privilege to be a witness for Jehovah, and all who really love the Lord will want to take part in the work and will do so. All will be anxious to work together in exact harmony. If some are inclined to oppose the service work, that of itself is proof that they are not in harmony with the kingdom message and are not Jehovah’s witnesses. Let the loyal ones not engage in a controversy, but let them go on with the work; and if interfered with by those who do oppose, withdraw and organize yourselves into a body for harmonious action. There must now be united activity in the publicity of the truth, and only those who are in full unity will stand together and stand on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses will want to work in exact harmony with headquarters that there may be no discord, and will therefore arrange to attend the conventions named and not try to arrange other conventions that might conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year specific periods of time have been set aside for united work, and this work will be carried on by the brethren and designated as United Testimony Periods. This is preferable to calling them drive periods. “United testimony periods” is Scriptural and in harmony with the work of the Lord, and means a specific time set aside in which all witnesses of Jehovah who possibly can do so will engage in field service. These united testimony service periods are designated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bound-Book Testimony Period.</span><span class="font3"> January 30 to February 7. During this period a special effort will be made to place the bound books in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">International Testimony Period.</span><span class="font3"> April 30 to May 8 inclusive. This seems to be the best period for the brethren all over the earth to engage in a uniform and united forward movement in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom. It is springtime in the north and autumn season in the south, and a suitable time for all to engage in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">200,000-Hour Testimony Period.</span><span class="font3"> July 2 to July 10 inclusive. It is thus designated to afford more hours for field work, that a greater number of testimonies may be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Harvest Witness Period.</span><span class="font3"> September 3 to 11 inclusive. This is the grain harvest season, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and when the people are in a better attitude of mind to learn of the Lord. The period also includes Labor Day in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Praise Testimony Period.</span><span class="font3"> November 12 to 20 inclusive. That will follow the conclusion of the fiscal year and be the beginning of another year. It will find God’s people throughout the earth united in the happy cause and giving praise to God as they sing forth the wonders of his works and the blessings that he is bestowing upon those that love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In all of these testimony periods the witnesses of Jehovah are engaged in harmonious publicity, in this, that they are making known Jehovah God, his King, and his kingdom. In every part of the earth the brethren will realize that they are working together in exact harmony with their brethren elsewhere, and that Christ Jesus is leading on in the great campaign against the enemy and within a short time his efforts, by the grace of God, will be crowned with complete victory to the glory of the Most High.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark53"></a>THE CAUSE OF DEGENERATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">L</span><span class="font3">UCIFER, the holy cherub, was the first one of God’s spirit creatures to sin. Adam, the first man on earth, was the first one of our world, and the first of the earthly creatures, to sin. By his unlawful act sin entered into the world. Is the death penalty to be inflicted upon Lucifer for his transgression of God’s law? The judgment of God is that he must die and remain forever dead. This is according to Ezekiel’s prophecy, chapter twenty-eight, verses fifteen to eighteen, which reads: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty: thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee: and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.” Referring to the One whom God would use to execute the death penalty upon the unfaithful Lucifer, the book of Hebrews, chapter two, verse fourteen, says: “Forasmuch then as the children [of God on earth] are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.” The penalty for his violation of the law will be enforced in God’s due time. God has a due time for everything he does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name Lucifer means “light-bearer”, or morning star. After his sin he was known by the names of Dragon, Satan, Serpent, and Devil. (Rev. 20:1-3) When Jehovah gives a creature a name that name carries with it great significance. Dragon signifies “devourer”; Satan means “opposer”, or “adversary”; Serpent means “deceiver”; while Devil means “one who slanders”. These names indicate the wicked and completely abandoned course that the Devil has pursued since the crime in Eden. From then till now he has been the enemy and opposer of God, and likewise the enemy and adversary of every one who has tried to be obedient to God’s law. One who has been thus opposed by Satan has therefore to that degree been put to the test. It is evident from the Word of the Lord that Jehovah purposes to give all of his creatures an opportunity to choose to follow the Devil or to be obedient to God, and this explains why the execution of the judgment against Satan is so long deferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the third chapter of Genesis, verse fifteen, another part of the judgment entered by Jehovah at the time Adam was sentenced for his sin is this: “And I will put enmity between thee [the Serpent, the Devil] and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” There is a twofold meaning to this Scriptural statement. The literal serpent, then a beast walking on legs and feet, was sentenced to ever after crawl on its belly in the dust, and to be despised and killed by man. The serpent, also being used by Lucifer, became a symbol of deceit, representing the Devil. The “seed” of the serpent here mentioned means those creatures who would become tools or wilful representatives of the Devil. For instance, in John’s gospel, chapter eight, verses forty to forty-four, Jesus said to those who sought to kill him: “Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “woman” in this prophecy is a symbol of God's organization called Zion, which gives birth to the “seed” promised in God’s covenant with the patriarch Abraham. That “Seed” is The Christ, God's anointed One, in whom all the families of the earth are to be blessed in God’s due time. The judgment of Jehovah states that there would thereafter be enmity between the ‘seed of the serpent’ and the ‘seed of the woman’. The Devil and his angels and his visible representatives on earth have openly and violently opposed everyone who has earnestly sought to serve the Lord and follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. The fight has been and is between the anointed ones of the Lord on one side and the Devil and his angels on the other. The words of the apostle to Christians in Ephesians, chapter six, verse twelve, state: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,” or, according to the marginal reading, “against wicked spirits in heavenly places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this part of the judgment there is a vague promise made of victory by the ‘seed of the woman’, in this, that the ‘seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent’s head’. It follows that the “seed” must be brought forth and until that time God would permit the enemy Satan to go on with his nefarious work and to do his worst; and this he has done. But God’s promise is that Satan shall meet defeat, and that in due time he shall be bruised under the feet of the anointed One. (Rom. 1G:2O) The fact that the head of the enemy is to be bruised, and that it is to be done by the ‘seed of the woman’, causes a ray of light to shine upon the pathway of man and indicates that there is a better time coming in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since that better condition must be brought about by the ‘seed of the woman’ as God’s instrument, such</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“seed” must be made perfect and in complete harmony with God. That this may be done, it follows that there must be a “new creation” brought forth by Jehovah before the better condition of man can be had. A few of the offspring of Adam have tenaciously held to that ray of hope. This has been true of some of them even though they could not comprehend its meaning. But today the student of the divine purposes who with thankful heart reverentially pursues the unfolding of God’s purposes rejoices in this faint ray of hope held forth in the divine judgment entered long centuries ago in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the day that God entered that judgment he knew every detail of his arrangement concerning man. His love, which is the perfect expression of his unselfishness, provided all the details of that arrangement to be carried out in due time. That arrangement provides for the recovery of man by and through the means of a new creation. The wisdom of God directed the unfolding and carrying out of his arrangement gradually. When it is completed it will reflect his glory, his wisdom, his justice, his love and his boundless power. In faith let us now hasten on to learn more of God’s wonderful works, because one thus learning will find the way that leads to life and happiness. For Jesus said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Degeneration means the process of deterioration, that is to say, growing worse and worse, and which persisted in leads to debasement and complete degradation. Mankind once outside of Eden, their degeneration began and continued until it reached a climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perfect man is one perfect in mind and body, and possessing the right to live. The judgment of Jehovah entered against Adam took away his right to life. When expelled from Eden he still possessed soundness of mind and organism; but, he being condemned to die, the decree must be carried out, and the death process began. Although man had disobeyed his Creator and had thereby forfeited all claims upon his friendship, yet God was considerate of him. He and his wife were naked. The record of Genesis, chapter three, verse twenty-one, says: “Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them. ’ ’ The presumption is that the skins were taken from animals, but such is not necessarily true nor is it so important. The fact that God clothed them was the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There could have been no need to have such coats to protect them from the storms or inclement weather, because at that time there were no storms on the earth, neither was there excessive cold. The temperature of the entire earth was practically the same, this being produced by the aqueous canopy or water ring that enveloped the earth. The coats were provided probably merely as a covering to hide their nakedness from each other’s eyes, and from the eyes of their children when born. Whatever the reason, it was an act of loving-kindness on the part of the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record concerning the birth of children to Adam and Eve his wife is brief. It does not claim to give the names of all their children. Cain is the first one named, and Abel the second. It is certain, however, that other children were born, both male and female, and lived contemporaneously with Abel and Cain. Doubtless both of these men were the heads of families. The Scriptures specifically state that Cain had a wife; and she must have been one of Adam’s children, therefore she must have been the sister of Cain. (Gen. 4:17) The name Cain means ‘ ‘ acquired ’ ’. Eve would have in mind the seed that God had promised that should bruise the serpent’s head, and she would reason that now she had acquired that seed that would ultimately bring her victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But Eve was disillusioned in course of time, for Cain’s wicked course only served to prove that the degeneration of the human race due to sin had begun and that man could not of himself stop or remove it.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark55"></a>MAN’S DOMINION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font3">O HAVE dominion means to reign or rule over. God purposed from the creation of the earth that perfect man should have dominion over the earth and its creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A prince means a governor or ruler who holds sway by authority. The perfect man Adam was made a prince or ruler of the earth. One clothed with authority is always subject to the one conferring that authority and must conform to the terms and conditions upon which the authority is conferred. All power and authority will, by final analysis, be found to reside in Jehovah. All power and authority rightfully exercised must be exercised in harmony with his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah expressed his purpose of creating man. Addressing himself undoubtedly to the Logos, his faithful and active agent in the creation of all things, he said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepcth upon the earth.”—Gen. 1:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The power of Jehovah knows no limitation. For him to will a thing to be created means that it is certain to be done according to his will. Having determined to make man in his own image and likeness, he proceeded so to do. It being his will that man should be a prince and have dominion over the things of the earth, this was done. That man was created for the earth and that the earth was created for man there is not the slightest room for doubt. Upon this point God’s will is expressed: “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; I am the Lord, and there is none else. I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.”—Isa. 45:18,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the dominion of all things resides in Jehovah he could give it to whomsover he might will. It is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” (Ps. 24:1) Again, in Psalm 115:16 are these words: “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s; but the earth hath he given to the children of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man, as well as the earth, belongs to Jehovah, because God created man. The authority of man to have dominion over the earth having been conferred upon man by Jehovah, man must exercise that authority and dominion in harmony with God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Adam was granted dominion and made a prince in the earth the duty and obligation devolved upon him to exercise that authority in harmony with his Creator. Adam was placed in Eden as its caretaker. He was not required to put forth laborious efforts to produce his food. Eden yielded freely all the food that was essential for his sustenance and for his pleasure. He was given control over the animals, the fowls, and the fish, and these were to render and did render obedience to him. He was clothed with power and authority to produce his own kind. Had he exercised that God-given authority in harmony with his Creator’s will he would have produced a perfect and happy family of children. God gave him the privilege to exercise his own faculties. He could willingly obey or disobey. This, however, did not at all relieve him from the obligation of being in harmony with Jehovah and exercising his authority in harmony with God’s holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eden was a large district, larger than is generally supposed. It must have embraced a considerable area of land. Four rivers flowed out from the garden and watered the land round about. Eden not only had beautiful groves which pleased the eye and produced food, but therein were to be found all the precious stones and much fine gold. The garden portion of Eden was on the eastern side, and the entrance was from the east. It was more beautiful than the other part of the district. It was in that garden that man was placed as the caretaker and where he found his pleasure and his employment. The earth was for man, and the perfect prince was placed in a perfect home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ecclesiastical teachers misrepresenting God and his Word have led the people to believe that had Prince Adam remained a good and faithful officer of Jehovah God, in due time God would have taken him to heaven. There is absolutely no evidence upon which to base such a conclusion. Adam had no promise of heaven. There never was a possibility, under any circumstances or conditions, of his going to heaven. He was strictly and purely of the earth. The earth alone was to be his everlasting home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning this it is written, in First Corinthians 15:47, “The first man is of the earth, earthy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the earth was made for the home of man we should not expect to find any promise of heaven for him, and there is not a word found in the Scriptures whereby Adam was promised heaven as a home. A proper understanding of this matter here will enable the student to have a clear understanding of what shall be the final destiny of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The dominion of earth was never absolutely and irrevocably given to Adam. Had that been done God could not have taken it away from him even though he disobeyed. Nor was Adam given life without some limitations. Upon this point the ecclesiastical teachers have misrepresented God and his Word and led the people into ways of error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptural proof is conclusive that life and dominion were conferred upon Adam to be held and enjoyed by him forever upon condition that Adam render obedience to the great Giver. It would be inconsistent for God to give his creature life and dominion with no conditions or limitations added. In the event his creature, possessing life and dominion, should become a rebel his rebellion would continue forever if his life were to continue forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy, yielding to the seductive influence of Satan, have fallen into this great error. They have proceeded upon the theory that God granted Adam endless life; and that Adam, having become a rebel, must spend his eternity in torment, being alienated from God. But the Scriptures do not at all support such a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the contrary, the Scriptures show that God gave man life and made him a prince in the earth upon the expressed condition that man be obedient to God. Should man never be disobedient and always remain in harmony with his Creator he would forever enjoy life and dominion over the earth. But in the event he should become a rebellious creature, then the condition attached was: “Dying thou shalt die.” With the coming of death all things would be lost. Death therefore would conclusively prove that man’s dominion and his life were held conditionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no thought expressed in the creation of man, and dominion granted to him, that he should ever go to torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no thought expressed in the Bible anywhere that God purposes to put any of his creatures into a place of endless torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the contrary, the declaration of his law is plain and simple, and means that the life and dominion of Adam were granted upon condition that he obey and that disobedience would mean the loss of his princely authority and his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no authority supporting the theory that God will ever destroy the earth by fire. No such intimation was ever given to Adam, regardless of whether he should be faithful or unfaithful. Again the clergy have fallen into a great error. Misled by Satan, they have seized upon the statement of the Apostle Peter to support their theory that God intends to destroy the earth. That statement is found in Second Peter 3:7. It reads: “The heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” The clergy reason that if the earth is destroyed, the good ultimately go to heaven and the evil to a place of endless, torture, and this being true, of course there would be no necessity for the existence of the earth. In this conclusion they are clearly, wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words “heaven” and “earth”, used by the apostle in the text just quoted, are used symbolically. “Earth,” as the word is used in the text, means the visible part of the world, which world is Satan’s organization. “Heaven” symbolically represents the invisible part of the same world. Heaven and earth, as used in this text, compose the world. “World” means mankind organized into forms of government under the supervision of an invisible overlord. For many centuries Satan has been the overlord or god of this world, as we read in Second Corinthians 4, verses 3 and 4. Satan has been invisible and is invisible to man. The organization of men into governments is visible and is represented by the word ‘ ‘ earth ’ ’. Heaven and earth constitute the evil world which shall in due time pass away. This scripture has no reference whatsoever to the original dominion which God gave to Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, through his prophet, says: “The earth abideth for ever.” This is written in Ecclesiastes 1:4. God is unchangeable, according to the statement of his own Word in Malachi 3:6. God having made the statement that he will never destroy the earth, therefore we may know that it will abide forever. The Scriptures show that it is God’s purpose that the earth shall in due time be inhabited. The Scriptures are entirely consistent with themselves. The statement of the Apostle Peter and the statement of the prophet are entirely consistent when understood. The wicked world, made up of evil invisible power and visible organization, shall pass away. The Apostle Peter had this thought, because in the same connection he said: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” Read this, if you will, in Second Peter 3:13. The earth shall abide through all the ages and shall always stand as a witness to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>

Rutherford’s books, and they have pulled the veil from my eyes, so I am now able to see the light of truth as it flows from God’s storehouse, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I wish information as to being a sharpshooter or pioneer, and 1 wish the wholesale price list, and the necessary authority to act as a witness for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I thank you in advance for the information and favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C. S. M----</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">, Fla.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Farming ■—Present and Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font5">ARMING is a partnership between man, the soil and the weather. One of the world’s most successful horticulturists once said to us, “When we fail to get a good crop, we always know that it is our fault. We have not done the right thing at the right time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Possibly, in view of last summer’s great drought, some would consider the above statement too broad; but as a general truth it holds good. The Lord usually provides enough cool, invigorating days, enough warm, moist ones, enough sunshine, enough breezes, enough heat, to develop and mature the crops which can be grown in a given climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The soil is important, too. Almost any kind of crops can be grown on some kinds of soil, but other soils are naturally adapted to but a limited number of crops. If they are to be used for growing other kinds of food than that usually grown upon them, they require to be rebuilt or reconditioned to adapt them to the work in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer himself is one of the most important of the three factors. We know of an instance where forty years ago the dwellers on a stony piece of soil in eastern Pennsylvania lived in the direst poverty, being able to obtain from it only the most meager sustenance. So desperate was their plight that they were known to recover from the highways the droppings of the horses, to be used as plant food, yet on that same area today five families are living in affluence, maintaining a truck and several splendid autos and living in homes that have every convenience and comfort of modern life, including electricity. They are getting this all out of the same fields, which today are a delight to the eye, a perfect picture of fertility and plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Competent Farmer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must be admitted that today, in order to succeed in the farming business, a man must have a greater variety of exact knowledge and make better use of it than in almost any other ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;739</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">business. He must change his plans with every change in the weather, and the decisions must be quick and accurate. Certain conditions often make it necessary to do two days’ work in one. The decision as to when to do a particular piece of farm work is of great importance. Harvesting requires dry weather; plowing requires that it be moist but not wet; the driving of fence posts is done to best advantage when the soil is completely saturated with water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A truly competent farmer must be a good judge of the weather, a good architect and builder, a good mechanic, a good judge of soils, and a good biologist. He must be a first-class salesman and an expert buyer. If he is wanting in any of these things someone is sure to try to take advantage of him, and the farmer has been taken advantage of in all ages up until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Taken as a whole, the farmers of today are about the best-informed class of citizens we have. It has been said that “if Julius Caesar should enter any legislative assembly in America today he would be unable to tell the farmer from the banker. The farmers and bankers listen to the same music, the same talks, the same jokes over the same radio at the same moments. When the farmer’s daughter drives to town in her auto she is wearing the same style of hat and gown as her city cousin.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here and there are some who think it is still the province of the city man to prey upon the tillers of the soil. A New York mail order house sent to up-state farmers some unordered goods, stick pins, neckties, socks, etc. If the goods were not promptly returned, bills and threatening letters were sent to the farmers. One such farmer receiving the first letter wrote in reply: “Goods received. I do not want them and will be glad to return them to your duly authorized representative on payment of one dollar for storage on same.” In at least that particular case, the attempted biter got bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmers are always confronted with some</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">new swindling schemes. In 1930 thousands of bushels of wheat were stolen from Kansas and Oklahoma, wheat farmers. This wheat was mostly taken from bins on farms where there are no improvements. The farmers soon found out what to do. They scatter throughout the wheat little sheets of marked paper, one hundred sheets to each thousand bushels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the pioneer farmer who made America. His capacity for hard work and his willingness +o take a chance created a class of men who think quickT<sup>r</sup> and act forcefully. The training which these men received in wrestling with the forces of nature made them independent to the point of touchiness, and makes them a class of people that, when deeply stirred, are capable of powerful collective action for either right or wrong, depending upon how they are guided to the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Choice of a Farm</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most important choice any man ever makes in this life is his decision as to whether or not he will spend his life as far as he is able to the glory of God’s name. His second most important choice, most people would say, is as to the one who shall share his home with him. This is still an exceedingly important item in the life of a farmer or in the life of any man; but really as a business move, the most important thing a farmer ever does is to select his farm. Tie might find some other girl that is just as good or pretty nearly as good, but the old idea that a farm is a farm and that any one of them can be readily transformed into a productive and profitable enterprise is not quite true, despite the illustration mentioned in the forepart of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why, under present conditions, settle for life on a farm which is badly located as respects markets, roads and good neighbors; which has poor soil, poorly drained, poor buildings, and is in a run-down condition, when farms which are the opposite in all these particulars may as well be had?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But we might allow that there are not enough first-class farms to g8 around and that for family or other reasons it might be desirable to build up and operate a deserted or run-down place. This can be done. Soils can be drained. Water standing near the surface of a soil causes the development of a shallow root system; then, •when the water level sinks in midsummer, the crops are unable to reach it and water is allimportant in the production of crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Canadian Department of Agriculture in its studies of soil moisture and crop production claims to have disclosed that in the production of one bushel of wheat, nature uses over thirty-one tons of water. We do not know just how this calculation was reached. It seems extremely large. We give it for what it is worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a soil has been impoverished by the continuous growing of one crop, it is benefited by discontinuing the growing of that particular crop and raising something else. This not only gives the soil a rest, but interferes more or less with the development of the enemies and parasites wdiich have come to make their home in the neighborhood with the expectation of preying on the crop to wdiich they are accustomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soils winch are poor at the outset can be built up by the legumes in the manner explained by W. H. Barton in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> Nos. 247 and 263. Buckwheat has won a well deserved reputation in the north as a poor soil crop, the first tobe planted in subduing newly cleared territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A wise farmer carefully plans his different fields for crops especially suited to the conditions they present. Thus a stiff, heavy clay or silt is naturally reserved for grass and grain crops; wdiile a lighter, sandy loam is chosen for corn, potatoes, beans, or some such cultivated crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ohio has a soil doctor, an expert agricultural chemist, engaged in the wmrk of reviving weak and run-dowm farm lands. Equipped with a kit of all kinds of fertilizers and chemicals he travels on a light truck and stops at scheduled points where growlers come in with their problems and samples of their soils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As early as 1840 New England had on its hands the problem of deserted farms. Many New/ England farms which would now provide a living if properly worked were deserted for the cheap and rich western lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The best proof that depleted lands can be brought back is found in the fact that they have been rejuvenated by the methods described in Mr. Barton’s articles. Many a farmer has lived and died poor because he did not know that each day the solid and liquid manures should be taken out and put in a fresh place. The average barnyard is the farmer’s wastebasket, and his ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most soils contain a large reserve, of plant food, but it is only through natural weathering processes that the mineral matter is slowly converted into plant food. There are in America at least one hundred million acres of land, well located and rich, but wholly or partially unproductive because in swamps or overflowed seasonably, which could be reclaimed by cooperative action aided by the State. In due time all these acres and millions more will be productive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Choice of Crops</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certain crops, such as corn, potatoes, oats and alfalfa, are grown in every state in the Union. The most important crop is maize, or Indian corn, in America universally called “corn”. This crop exceeds in value any other, and in most years exceeds any two other crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though grown in every state in the Union, the corn belt proper extends from western Ohio, through northern Indiana and Illinois, covering the whole state of Iowa and northern Missouri. It reaches its greatest density in north-central Illinois, in the prairies between the Wabash and Illinois rivers. The first European settlers in America found this crop growing here under cultivation by the Indians. Potatoes are another product native to the American continent. Next to wheat and rice, corn and potatoes are two of the most important of the world’s food products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wheat belt is divided into two parts: the northern belt centers in Minnesota and the Dakotas; while the southern belt covers southern Indiana and Illinois, central Missouri, and Kansas and Nebraska. Eastern Washington is also an important wheat-producing area. Except in the Northwest, wheat is sown in the fall. .The land is plowed to catch the equinoctial rains, and the wheat goes in at about the first frost, to beat the Hessian fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cotton belt begins at North Carolina and extends southwestward and westward midway between the mountains and the sea to central Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Practically all of California’s oranges are produced on a strip ten miles wide and sixty miles long. The orange belt of Florida also covers a comparatively restricted area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In planting crops, the farmer is obliged to consider which crops and how many shall be raised. The small grains require much labor at planting time only. Corn, potatoes, sugar beets, and cotton require constant summer cultivation, and harvesting can be done only by hand. Consequently, the farmer who has mainly his own labor to depend upon must avoid a combination of crops of which the busiest seasons correspond or overlap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most American farmers raise the crops where the soil, climate and other conditions are best suited to them, and pay little attention to the problems of transportation to centers of consumption. The wheat growers of Kansas and Alberta consider as a matter of course that there is no reason why they should not compete in the markets of Liverpool, regardless of their long, expensive haul. Owing to the long growing season in California and the Southwest, alfalfa there yields six or more cuttings a season, instead of three or four as in the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Originally the farm provided its own food, clothing, and shelter. Gradually, with the increase of manufactures, the farmer came to buy more of his essentials from those who could make them faster, better and cheaper. To do this, he raised large acreages of the crops that brought him the largest net profit. Thus, the special lines of farming, such as wheat raising, potato growing, and cotton growing have been developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principle of crop rotation was known and practiced three thousand years ago. The principle of letting the soil rest once in every seven years .is set down in the Scriptures as a law by 'which the Israelites were to be governed. The real owner of the earth is the Lord, and in due time He will establish and enforce the law’s under which it will be cropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Farm Animals</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The raising of cattle has always been a frontier industry. Before the soil was broken by the plow, the natural grasses furnished cheap and abundant pasturage and gave the farmer food for his table while clearing operations were under way. Man is now measurably independent of the horse, but it will apparently be a good while before he will be independent of the cow. Ox teams have not all passed, but they are passing. In Vermont, in 1929 there were 599 oxen, as compared with 725 in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Horses and mules seem to be passing out too; yet there are still a great many, and it is claimed that there are 5,500,000 mules and some 14,500,-000 horses, despite the immense number of 26,-000,000 gasoline-driven vehicles. The growers of cotton, rice and sugar cane have proven to their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font5"> satisfaction that the mule can do more work for less money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A farmer has to stop, look and listen before he purchases a tractor. If the machine is used for only a few days each year, his overhead charges are very heavy. It is claimed by experts that a traction engine cannot be profitably employed on a farm of less than 240 acres. One great disadvantage attaching to farm machinery is that the use of any particular machine is limited to so few days durmg the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Farmers all over the country still make much use of horses for agricultural work. There are 3,000,000 in France, and 4,000,000 in Germany. In 1788 there were but five horses in Australia; in 1850 there were 159,951; now there are 2,250,361. In Great Britain there are 1,204,198 horses engaged in agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Hired Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new hired man made his appearance one hundred years ago, in the midsummer of 1830, when Cyrus H. McCormick, at Rock Ridge, Va., demonstrated a crude horse-power machine which cut ripe wheat and threw it on a platform from which it might be raked into bundles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the days when wheat was harvested with a sickle and dressed with a flail, it required thirty-five to fifty hours of labor per acre for a yield of fifteen bushels. With the tractor and combine the same result is now accomplished in three quarters of an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider what a vast amount of human labor has been dispensed with in the growing and </span><span class="font4">harvesting of </span><span class="font5">wheat. The myriads of harvesters once needed to gather in the crops are no longer required, and the food which they once ate is now stored in bins, seeking a market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The multiplying </span><span class="font5">of agricultural machinery </span><span class="font4">explains why </span><span class="font5">the proportion of the gainfully employed which was engaged in agriculture declined from 83 percent in 1820 to 26 percent in 1920, and why 4,000,000 of the farm population have abandoned agriculture in the last decade. ■ A quantity of grain may be sown today in thirty-three minutes that sixty years ago required ten hours and thirty-six minutes; and a job of harvesting can be done in one hour that would have taken forty-six hours and forty minutes in 1850.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On a rvell-managed farm a gasoline engine pumps the water, drives the water system, operates the farm light plant, grinds wheat, saws wood, operates the grain elevators, runs the grindstone, mixes concrete; and, in fact, someone has said that the small gasoline engine will do practically anything a hired man can do except take the hired girl to towm on Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Planting Eleven Hundred Acres in a Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The San Francisco </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> tells of a man in Colusa, Calif., who sowed 1100 acres of rice in less than a day. He did it by airplane. In China it would have taken 5,000 workmen a month to sow and replant that rice, and the whole 5,000 would have worked in the fields every day until and including harvest ; but the man who sowed the rice harvested and dressed it by tractor in a few days, with less than a dozen men. In China most of the rice would have gone to feed the workers who raised it; in America it is all for sale. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seventy-five years ago, the average agricultural worker in the United States could care for but twelve acres of crops. Now, considering the United States as a whole, he can attend to thirty-four acres, and in some small states the average is more than one hundred acres. On an individual farm it runs as high as 300 acres or more. The less farm, labor there is employed, the less work there is for the farmer’s wife, who does not have such a large crew for which to cook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The modern farmer is continually on the lookout for any mechanical device that will save labor. In a wheat-growing district in Washington, the wheat is delivered eighteen miles by a pipe line. The grain slides through a one-inch galvanized iron pipe direct to the railroad station, where it is either sacked or run directly into the freight cars. Haulage costs, which would be about fifteen cents a bushel, are, by the pipe line method, reduced to less than two cents a bushel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Statistics show that the average farm income is in the neighborhood of three times the value of the machinery on the farm. In Florida, where the value of machinery on the farms averages $30.43, the yearly income of the farm-worker averages $119.72; in Iowa, with machinery averaging $196.55 to the farm, the farm-worker’s average annual income is $611.11; in North Dakota, Avhere the machinery averages a value of $238.84 per farm, the average income per farmworker is $755.62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. It is very apparent that it is unprofitable to grow cereals as money crops unless enough can be planted to warrant an investment in seeders, harvesters, binders, etc. In America between 1910 and 1920 there was a tremendous jump in the value of machinery on farms. By 1920 the value of machinery on farms had increased to $3,594,772,928, a gain over the 1910 figures of $2,329,632,145, or 184.1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Less Food Used by Animals .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one considers the vast increase in the amount of farm machinery in the United States in recent years, it is very apparent that the work which is being done by the machinery is not being done by horses or mules and the food which they would have eaten is not consumed. Today it is estimated that 52,905,000 acres are needed to supply food for our horses and mules, but that is 18,492,500 fewer acres than were necessary for this purpose in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the farmers of America constitute only 4 percent of the farmers of the world, yet because of their improved machinery they produce 70 percent of the world's corn, 60 percent of its cotton, 25 percent of its wheat, oats and hay, 13 percent of its barley, and 7 percent of its potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mechanical servants are not as well cared for as they should be. We have seen the statement that in Kansas the loss on the average farm due to machinery’s being in bad order when most needed is $100 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effect of farm machinery in reducing the number of men engaged in agriculture is noticeable in England and Wales, where the number engaged in agriculture between 1911 and 1929 gradually shrunk by about 130,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Sweden about 45 percent of the farms are using electricity for lighting and power purposes, but in the United States the shortsighted power trust is so intent upon grabbing everything that they have ignored this market, and as a consecpience not more than 3 percent of American farms are receiving electric current from poiver lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;We do not know how efficient the device is, but a machine has been developed in England for curing hay by the application of electric current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A device which is saving labor, and therefore operates in the same direction as labor-saving machinery, is the use of paper strips for the growing of pineapples in Hawaii. The growers raise 30 percent more pineapples than they otherwise would, and save labor too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the last year a two-row mechanical picker has been demonstrated by a cornfield survey at the college of agriculture at the University of Illinois. Hand husking took 5.1 hours more labor per acre, not counting the horses and wagon, but the new two-row picker needed only 2.2 hours for the same work and transported itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Drift from Farm to City</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■With the largest part of the work on the farm being done by machinery it is inevitable that many residents on farms should seek employment in the cities. Hence it is not surprising to find that while our farm population in January 1910 was 32,076,960, yet in January 1929 it had fallen to 27,511,000. Meantime the general population of the United States had increased more than 30 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only are there 4,500,000 few’er farmers, but there are actually 150,000 fewer farms in the United States today than there were in 1930. Farmers complain that they bear the cost of rearing and educating children and then deliver the finished product to the city. The nation’s child crop, as well as its food, comes mainly, from the farms. There are approximately 7,700,000 children under ten years of age on farms, as compared with 5,700,000 in cities having an equivalent total population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A survey of 20,000 farmers who left their farms and moved to the cities shows that 7,500 went because help on the farm was scarce, 5,000 because old age was coming on and the work was too hard, 4,000 because they were giving up to sons and sons-in-law, 2,200 to get adequate schooling for their children, and 500 because they had saved enough to obtain in the cities what they had been unable to get on the farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Somebody has said that for the first time in American history our unemployed have no place to go. If they are in the cities they cannot floe to the land, because the farms already produce more than can be satisfactorily sold. If they are on the farms they cannot go to the cities unless they wish to lengthen the bread lines. After the fourth generation, the energy of the country man is worn out in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'A Great Social Loss</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shift of millions of intelligent people from the country to the city has certainly lowered the once high standard of American country life and is therefore a distinct social loss. As one New England farmer tersely put it, “This old farming community is like a fish pond with the game fish all fished out. All we got loft now is the bullheads and suckers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present world-wide depression in all lines has led to a temporary slackening in the movement away from farms. Although the net movement away last year was 151,000 persons, an increase of 359,000 births over deaths on farms brought the farm population on January 1,1931, to 27,430,000 persons, as compared with 27,222,-000 persons on January 1, 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is conceded that farm women are still overworked, although not as much so as was formerly the case. A survey of 700 farm women found that they were working more than sixty-three hours a week, of which time fifty-two hours and seventeen minutes a week was spent on homemaking activities; while eleven hours and thirteen minutes was spent on daily work, caring for poultry, gardening, and other tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the national convention of representative farm women held in Chicago, there was a generally expressed desire for better sanitary conditions, more conveniences in the home, better educational advantages for the children, more time for recreation, better clothing, a bank account, and more and better literature. In all these respects farm women seem to be no different from other women, because the things they want, everybody wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sixty farmerettes who came from Middletown, Md., to make a two-days’ study of the city of New York admitted that they would rather go back to their farms than to have to live in the big village which houses the Empire State and Chrysler buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The former French premier, Tardieu, declares that the security and stability of France at the present time of world economic crisis is due to the protection and encouragement accorded to the French farmers. G. W. Russell, famous Irish scholar, expresses his alarm at a condition which has developed, in America, in which in ten years 4,000,000 persons have left the land, 19,000,000 acres have gone out of cultivation, and 89,000 farms have ceased production. He considers it a dangerous situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is perhaps not generally known that we have in southern Alberta the largest collection of aristocratic land owners in America. To this place have come princes, barons and counts, some with plans of establishing a feudal system such as prevails in Europe; others to work as farmhands before starting on ranches of their own. Still others have bought farms to be managed by a foreman, a place where they could come for a rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 'world’s farms are being counted. The census is expected to cover 97 percent of the sum-face of the earth and 98 percent of its population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">FaiTS—€onege3—Conferences</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soon after 1800, the fair took its rise, and now over 3,000 fairs are annually conducted, devoted to the interests of farming. The first known agricultural association was that of the Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture, founded in 1723 by a group of Scottish agriculturists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first regularly organized agricultural experiment station in America was established&quot; at .......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn., in ..... 1875. There are now experimental stations in every state and territory in the Unites States, including also stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico and Guam. All together in all parts of the world there are 728 such institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">European stations are usually confined to single lines of investigation; while American stations generally embrace several departments. The European stations do not issue bulletins of information, but the United States stations do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germany w<sup>r</sup>as among the first nations of the world to establish agricultural colleges and experimental stations, followed closely by Belgium and Holland. France, Great Britain, and practically all the countries of Latin America have organized departments of agriculture dedicated to the promotion of the agricultural interests of their own national territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first agricultural conference took place in England in 1929; the second one took place at Cornell University in 1930; the next one is planned for some European country in 1933. At the conference at Cornell University it was ... mutually agreed that agriculture is depressed throughout the world, with the exception of Russia, and that the United States is one of the countries most- gravely affected. It was also agreed that agricultural economics cannot be separated from economic life in general. The farmer prospers or suffers in accordance with the changing conditions in finance and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The grain conference held in Europe early this year in an effort to decide what to do with the world’s surplus wheat was a complete failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Millions Yet to Be Saved</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scientists are only now beginning to think of saving by-products of the farming business. A million dollars has recently been put into the organization of a corporation that will utilize cornstalks. It is stated that more than 3,000 separate chemical materials can be produced from the three fundamental raw materials which are found at present in the country’s enormous . waste of cornstalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other farm wastes for which uses are being found are straw, oat hulls, peanut hulls, pea vines, bean plants, and dried pods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the pioneers could only have foreseen, what a boon to our country it would have been if they had left more of our virgin forests. They -wasted the treasures of a continent, but without realizing what they were doing; and probably another generation will say of us what we say of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Is There Overproduction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the World ’War the allied countries found themselves cut off from Russia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary, which hitherto had supplied a great part of their wheat. They called upon the rest of the world to make good the deficit, with, the result that the farmers of Canada, the United States, Argentina and Australia cleared and sowed new lands, and in four years the sown area overseas from France increased as much as in the previous forty years. Moreover prices for the wheat were raised from one to three dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as the war was over, the Danubian countries and Russia sought to regain their previous -wheat markets, and by the peculiar methods which she is following, Russia at least, which before the World War exported about one-fourth of the world’s exportation, is bound to regain the business which she lost. Moreover, at the beginning of this year, it was stated that Soviet Russia contemplates an increase of 19 percent in her wheat acreage to be seeded this spring, above last year’s total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America needs not more than 600,000,000 bushels of wheat, yet regularly produces 800,000,000, and on one occasion, namely, in 1925, produced 1,000,000,000 bushels. The area devot</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ed to raising wheat in the United States in 1930 was larger by 14,000,000 acres than it was before the World War. Kansas alone put 2,000,000 acres more to seed than it ever did before. Between 1911 and 1928 the world increased its acreage and production of wheat by 27 percent. In fifteen years Canada has increased its wheat acreage 14,084,700 acres, the United States 10,378,200 acres, Argentina 5,930,400, and Australia 3,459,400. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1930 Canada had bumper crops of all grains, 11,000,000 bushels more of wheat than was first expected, an increase of 46,000,000 bushels of oats over the year before, 35,000,000 bushels more of barley, and 9,000,000 bushels more of rye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Europe, including Russia, is still the largest grain producing area in the world. In 1928 she produced 1,381,000,000 bushels of wheat, while the United States yielded 903,000,000, Canada 534,000,000, Argentina 310,000,000, India 390,000,000, Australia 159,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since 1921, Italy has been engaged in a vast scheme of interior colonization. As a result, since 1921 approximately 2,000,000 acres of formerly useless soil have been made available for the farmers, and the production of w<sup>T</sup>heat has increased 50 percent, from 46,000,000 quintals in 1924 to 70,000,000 quintals in 1929. (A quintal is 100 kilograms, almost two bushels.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Farm Board</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is quite evident that the experts at Washing-. ton do not know what to do about the wheat situation. The particular reason why the European wheat conferences were a total failure is because the United States did not say what disposition it intends to make of the more than 200,000,000 bushels which it bought at prices far above the market (about 92c a bushel), and at last accounts still held in storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Senator Borah thinks that the wheat should be sent as a gift to China to create among the starving Chinese an appetite for wheat bread. The Farm Board has stated that it cannot follow a policy of buying at prices above the market, paying heavy storage charges, and selling below cost. Hence it urges farmers to reduce -wheat acreage by 20 percent, and in some sections of the country the farmers are making an effort to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time that the government farm board is trying to get the farmers to reduce their wheat acreage, the experts in the government agricultural colleges are bending every effort at showing the farmers how to raise more wheat; all of which shows just how foolish our civilization is: one bunch of experts shouting that wheat production must be curtailed because nobody is making any profit on the wheat they raise, and another bunch of experts shouting that there is imminent danger that the whole human family will die of starvation because of the ravages of insect pests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scientists have not been wholly a boon to agriculture. Indigo, once an agricultural staple in India, is now altogether synthetic. Tanning materials are also made synthetically, and the fats which have been produced from peanut oil and cottonseed oil have resulted in decreased prices and markets for natural lard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Marketing Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t ask us to tell how to sell at a profit for about 70c a bushel several hundred millions of bushels of wheat which cost the growers an average of $1.22 per bushel to raise. We do not know the answer to this problem. We do not believe it has any answer. We explain here that it is the department of agriculture which puts the average American cost of raising wheat at $1.22 a bushel. The tariff commission made this cost 20c more, or $1.42 per bushel. If the farmer has to sell his wheat for 70c a bushel he is apparently selling it for but little if any more than half what it costs him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States Wheat Growers’ Association, embracing 150 growers in western Kansas and eastern Colorado, have agreed to hold their 1931 crop for sixty days after harvesting in an effort to obtain $1.00 a bushel for their grain. They have also agreed not to sow any seed wheat next fall unless that price is reached. It is almost certain that they will fail to get the price they seek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some Kansas farmers this year were so discouraged over the low price for wheat that they sold their growing grain for $2.00 an acre, and one man offered to sell 3,000 acres at a dollar an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Oregon last winter, one farmer who had between 6,000 and 7,000 acres, most of it in wheat, used dressed wheat for fuel, claiming that at $16.00 a ton it makes a cheaper fuel than coal at $20.00, and that it makes a hot, even fire, particularly good for banking overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some farmers have noticed that there is a big difference between the 70c, which they receive for a bushel of wheat, and the $6.60, which they pay for the same wheat when made up into one-and-a-half-pound loaves of bread. However, the price of bread has come down since this complaint was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prices for farm products are inextricably bound up with a great variety of other subjects. A great war in which millions of men are taken from the fields and set to murdering one another inevitably sends the price of farm products skyward. The great industrial development of the 19th century accomplished the same result, because it brought into the factories millions of men who would otherwise have been in the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were waves of agricultural prosperity between 1850 and 1873, and between 1904 and 1914; and there were periods of agricultural adversity between 1822 and 1848, and between 1875 and 1900. We are going through a period of depression now. Wheat has reached the lowest price since 1896, and land cannot be sold for half what it would have brought in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmers are often discriminated against in legislation. During the World War they were allowed to receive but $2.00 per bushel for their wheat, whereas they should have been given $3.00. In 1920 the Federal Reserve Bank undertook ahead of time to do to the farmers what is being so successfully done now; i. e., the farmer was deflated by the Federal Reserve at the same time it was engaged in the happy process of inflation. In effect they took to themselves what should have gone to the farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the period from 1909 to 1925, the personal indebtedness of American farmers grew from $1,000,000,000 to $3,250,000,000. In 1880 three-fourths of the farmers owned their land; today over one-third are renters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The agricultural crisis is universal, farmers in Canada, in Australia, and on the continent of Europe are all suffering together. Canada has been so hard hit that there has been desperate talk of secession. Farming operations in New Zealand the past year have been conducted at a loss. Farm taxes are twice as high as they ought to be. The taxes of the farmers build up and maintain expensive highways which are hammered to pieces by buses, trucks and pleasure cars owned by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the farmer’s goods get to the market he does not receive a fair price for them. He is actually given but 37c on a dollar of what the customer has to pay. The remaining 63c goes to the people above mentioned who wear out the roads built with his money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer is disadvantaged by the practice of chain groceries of selling loss leaders, i. e., putting out butter, eggs and milk for less than cost so as to attract attention to other items. This has the effect of establishing low face values and compelling the farmers to dispose of their products at a price considerably less than their market value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Peerless, Mont., in March, eggs were sold as low as 5c a dozen, and in some instances they could not be sold at all and there was so little demand for them that they could not even be given away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1928 the average store clerk earned $2,100; the average worker in manufacturing industries earned $1,700; and. the average farm 'worker earned $1,000. Two years later the earnings of the farm workers had dropped to $540.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Senator Brookhart declared that ten years from now there will be no Yankee farmers; but there will be 12,000,000 peasants doffing their dirty caps to superiors who command them; but Senator Brookhart is mistaken. At the present rate of progress it would not take ten years, and before ten years, we think, the full establishment of God’s kingdom will have changed everything. In that happy era it will be literally true, ‘'■'Behold, I make all things new.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An item which may be mentioned here is the fact that while aviation has brought an element .of interest into the farmer’s life, it has not always brought him profit. There have been not a few instances in which his growing crops have been used as a landing field, not altogether to their benefit, and the only reward the farmer has received, if there were survivors of the visit, has been the consciousness that he was helping to introduce a new method of transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Big Menace—The Corporation Farm</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A farm, according to the United States census, is any plot of land which requires the service of at least one person during the greater part of the year. In the South, a farm is a plantation; in the West a farm'is a ranch. In 1930 there were 5,000 farms of less than three acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Farming has entered the machine age, and the small farmer is today as definitely out of the race as the old-style shoemaker who built shoes to order. The great Western plains are especially adapted to the use of machinery. In the year 1927, Thomas I). Campbell, of Harden, Mont., had 4,000 acres in wheat and 7,000 acres in flax. The Farmers’ National Company of Omaha, C. J. W. Classen, president, manages 635 farms in Iowa, and Nebraska. D. H. Doane, of St. Louis, operates 200,000 acres and has a dozen farm managers working for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Banks, and insurance and land companies, are taking over and managing farms wholesale. There are today many thousands of corporations actively engaged in farmingin the United States. This is in spite of laws in a number- of agricultural states, like Illinois and Iowa, forbidding such farm operation by corporations. All a farm corporation needs to do in order to get around these laws is to hire a lawyer to fix up the papers. Corporations in the United States do what they please, as they please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are corporations running cotton plantations in Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana. They have fruit ranches in 'Washington; seed companies in Michigan; poultry farms in Ohio; potato farms in Wisconsin; onion and peppermint farms in Indiana; and a farm in Missouri is especially devoted to the production of a kind of corn from which corncob pipes are made. There are hundreds of farming corporations in Wyoming, Idaho and adjacent states. Other corporations grow oranges and lemons in southern California, and there is a corporation duck farm on Long Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One corporation farm in Kansas contains 50,000 acres. The farm is operated by gangs of laborers. The corporation is not interested in having families live on its land. In 1917 there were 35,000 farms in Montana; now there are 14,000 farms, the other 21,000 having been swallowed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ail over Iowa the Yankee farmers are going broke, and the mortgage-holding trust companies of New York and Chicago are taking everything they have. Many banks, having sucked the lifeblood out of the farmers by the iniquitous interest system, are now operating chains of farms under trained farm managers at $1.00 per acre as their fee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world’s largest farm is, of course, the great Russian farm of approximately </span><span class="font6">224,000,</span><span class="font5">000 acres, which farm, operated entirely by machinery, is expected to produce not less than 22,000,000 tons of wheat in the year 1933. This is about twice as much as Russia ever exported </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> a single year before the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not see how anything can prevent the Russians from raising wheat more cheaply than it can be grown in any other part of the world, and if they succeed in marketing their grain in Europe, it is a foregone conclusion that worse times are ahead for the grain growers of the Western world than they have ever yet seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see no way out for them, nor indeed for the Russians or anybody else, except in the administration of earth’s tangled affairs by the only Ruler competent to administer them, namely, Christ Jesus, Jehovah God’s representative appointed for that very purpose and even now seated upon the throne of His glory and coming into His own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font5">ANADIAN PACIFIC—Long Run Engine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">System for Western Lines. Following an experiment conducted last spring (described in Section 18, Bulletin 259), when the Canadian Pacific Railway locomotive number 2808 was operated from Fort William to Calgary over the nine divisions, hauling a transcontinental passenger train in scheduled time, and retracing the 1,252 miles with another regular passenger train, the Company is preparing to extend the system whereby locomotives will pull trains over several divisions, instead of over a single division as at present. Besides saving time and allowing passenger trains to move on accelerated schedules, the new system will have the added advantage of allowing the Canadian Pacific to make wider use of its newer and more powerful locomotives, available as yet in limited numbers, inasmuch as one of these new engines will haul a train as far as 1,200 miles at a stretch, instead of about 125 miles as under the divisional system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The soundness of the economic principle underlying the operation of motive power over greater mileage already has been proved in one district where, by extending the runs of locomotives, it is now possible to do with thirty engines what formerly required fifty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the system of longer runs for locomotives is put in effect along the whole of the main line between Fort William and Vancouver, it will be necessary to operate only five motive power divisions, against the fourteen now in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aachen, Germany—International Newspaper Museum. The largest collection of newspapers in the world has now been made accessible to the public. It could heretofore be visited only by special permission. This international newspaper museum was founded in 1886. Among its collections of 150,000 newspapers are curiosities from all countries and in almost all languages of the world, including an Eskimo paper and manuscript newspapers from the middle of the last century. There is a spiritualistic newspaper printed in white on black paper. One of the first socialist newspapers, dating from 1849, is printed on dark red paper, and there is a copy of the Cologne </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Volkszeitung</span><span class="font5"> of October 31, 1889, which contains a 30-line account of the hundred-year jubilee of the firm of Solomon Oppenheimer printed in gold letters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> T LAST Germany is whipped and admits it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last cuts in salaries have been made; there is nothing more that can be done. In a formal statement the German government says! “The putting forth of the last power and reserves of the nation entitles the German government, and makes it its duty toward the German people, to tell the world: The limits of the privations we have imposed on our people have been reached.” The villainies of Versailles have been carried on for twelve years; now the time has come when there must be peace if European civilization is to be saved. But it is too late; it will not be saved; it is trembling on the brink of chaos even now. Only God’s kingdom, which will take the place of Satan’s rule, can save the people. But Satan’s governments must go; all of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Forest City Dress Mfg. Company, of Collinsville, Ill., have a strike on their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are said to have paid $3.40 for making a bundle of 24 dresses. That is about 14c per dress. These dresses retail at Collinsville for $9.98 each. Seems too bad, doesn’t it, to let a worker on a dress get only about 1J percent of the price ? Looks as if the ones that took the 98-J percent were not as kind and thoughtful and considerate as they might be, doesn’t it ? The total earnings of eight girls, each with a 53-hour week, showed a total of $26.80, or a fraction over 6c per hour for 424 hours of labor. How would you like to run a sewing machine all day at 6c per hour?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">One Priest to Every 100,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE legislature of the Mexican state of Vera</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cruz has passed legislation limiting the number of Catholic priests to one in every 100,000 of the population. The local apostolic delegate said truthfully that if “you reduce priests to one for every 100,000 you might as well do away with them entirely”. To which we merely add that that is exactly what is coming, and now is the t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font5">e to learn a trade or how to do some kind of useful work. However, we think, to be serious about it, that the Vera Cruz legislation is more in the nature of a gesture of protest than a sincere attempt to do what it would if really put in operation, i. e., it would destroy the Catholic church in Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TN THE Philippine Islands (from 1911 to 1920) A 24,436,889 vaccinations were carried out on a population of approximately 10 million persons ; and yet during that period 75,339 fatalities were recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of the vast system of commercial distribution has made the manufacturers of these serums very wealthy. As an example, The Mulford Company has grown from a mere $125,000 business into a $5,000,000 enterprise, with branches in most countries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifty-one establishments are licensed by the federal government for the interstate manufac-' ture and sale of vaccines and serums of about 1000 varieties, for human consumption. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a frightful thing to taint the blood of a great nation ..with the putrid matter extracted from laboratory animals specially diseased for that purpose. We feel it is our duty to vigorously expose and protest against these medically enforced diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">What Medical Men Say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Vaccination produces a condition analagous to syphilis.” Dr. W. R. Hadwen, M.D., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., J.P., in an address delivered in Town Hall, New York city, in May, 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Impetigo contagiosa, syphilis, tetanus, cellulitis, erysipelas, pyaemia, gangrene or boils, may occur from impure or mixed inoculation at the time of vaccination, or later.” Dr. A.

<p><span class="font5">“'Syphilitic contamination by vaccine lymph is by no means an unusual occurrence, and it is very generally overlooked, because people do not know when or where to look for it. I think that a. large proportion of the cases of apparently inherited syphilis are in reality vaccinal; and that syphilis in these cases does not show itself until the age of from eight to ten years, by which time the relation between cause and effect is lost sight of.” Dr. Brundenell Carter, F.R.C.S., L.S.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> claim the phenomena, of so-called vaccinal syphilis as in no respect of venereal origin, but as due to the inherent, although mostly dormant, natural history character of cowpox.” Charles Creighton, M.D., in his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nalttral History of Cotvpox and Vaccinal Syphilis,</span><span class="font5"> page 124.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Russia and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5"> NEWS item in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> (No. 291) says that Russia is preparing for war, with 20,000,000 men and women, according to the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail.</span><span class="font5"> I think it wise to accept anything from such a source with the proverbial grain of salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While realizing that only the Lord’s kingdom can put the affairs of the world in order, it is quite apparent that the Soviet sees the rottenness of the ecclesiastical, political and financial systems, and denounces them, as you are doing, only that they have nothing better with which to replace those systems. As a consequence they are being attacked by the above unholy trinity and grossly misrepresented in the press, particularly in such a conservative paper as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail,, </span><span class="font5">which is known to have a strong Catholic backing. One reading such poisonous articles that appear from t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font5">e to time would form the opinion that every person in Russia is a cutthroat and murderer, and that every man is running around with a couple of daggers in his hands and with all his whiskers sticking out; whereas quite the contrary obtains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newspaper stunt of last year, voicing Mr. Ratti’s (of the Jesuit order) scheme of prayers for the persecuted Christians and priests in Russia, fell flat, its object being to get the powers embroiled with the Soviet and stamp out Communism. Then, knowing that the Greek Church frauds were driven out during the revolution, the pope would step in and fill the country with an army of parasites who would make it their business to see that the common people supported them in the lap of luxury. As a matter of fact, there were no persecutions in Russia of either Christians or priests last year, for the simple reason that in that country there are no priests controlled by any outside authority, such as the Church of Rome or the Church of England, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scheme was a republication of what happened years ago, during the revolution, with the subtle object of gulling the public into the belief that it was happening in 1930, in the hope that the people would insist that the various nations take action. 'While not agreeing with the method the Bolshies adopted in disposing of their enemies the priests, we must admit that these deceivers reaped just what they had sown. Did not Rasputin and his crowd of thugs in skirts, in which the Word of God says is to be found the blood of the innocents, did not they reap a bloody harvest?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Geo, L. Robinson (Bulgaria)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One would have thought that the men of the cloth and flowing robes would have taken the lesson to heart, visited Woolworth’s for alarm clocks and donned overalls, etc. But no! Mr. Ratti has his eye on the teeming millions in Russia at so many dollars per head; and like the Devil, he is egotistical enough to think that he can get them. So he employs such a scare and warmongering newspaper as the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> to air his views. But it cannot be done nowadays. The people are taking newspaper propaganda with one eye wide open and the other wide shut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago the above screech attempted to prevent motorists from using Russian petrol, which is known to be good and cheap, by misrepresentation of facts, endeavoring to turn people against everything coming from that country. During the miners’ and general strike of 1926,1 was engaged in running thousands and thousands of barrels of Russian oil to London to be used for household purposes in place of coal gas, a suitable gas being obtained from this oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> never mentioned this, nor even said that they would not have this oil from cutthroats, robbers and murderers, to help squash the strike. In fact, nobody knew that we were getting oil from Russia to make gas, except the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> and others in the know. The poor reader was not even told that if it had not been for Soviet oil he might have been unable to read his daily mail at night or to cook his meals, etc. As an act of thankfulness for the services rendered by these people with the whiskers and daggers, the above scrap published a wholesale condemnation of the Soviet as being the cause of the miners’ strike, which was not a strike, but a lockout by the masters, as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no priests in Russia, and no central or outside authority can control or send ministers to the Soviet; in fact, the Bible Students cannot get in, but if they are not able to I’ll eat my hat. If they are unable to “wangle” in, nobody else can. It is impossible for one person to give a true account of the conditions in that unhappy country, having in mind its enormous size. It would require years of experience and travel there to get acquainted with things in general, but about the opposite is found of what is reported by the press. The people are allowed to worship God as they please, but must choose their own leader or minister and not let Mr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ratti or the archbishop of what’s-his-name do the choosing, or anyone else Hkely to see the possibility of squeezing hard-earned money out of the people, under the cloak of religion. Believe me, the people of Russia have had some fakers of the cloth, and they know almost as much about them as the Bible Students. The great pity is that they cannot see that Jehovah is the only One who can establish a government which will bring life, liberty and happiness to all mankind. Oh if man would only praise the Lord, and not rely on his own achievements!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a contrast to all the bloodcurdling stories we read about the Soviet, I happened to be there on one or two occasions and would like to go again, for I have found civility and kindness, which one would not expect if the newspaper accounts are true. While there, I noticed a party .of excursionists from the country, the women neatly dressed in silk jumpers, etc., and the men smart and mostly clean shaven. They were visit- ‘ ing the port and taking a keen interest in their surroundings, going freely from place to place with the apparent object of improving their knowledge, some of them even conversing in English. My thoughts ran back to my home town and I began contrasting them with a similar party which we often see at the seaside. On any summer day at the seaside resorts in Britain are to be seen a party of trippers dolled up with paper hats, blowing cardboard hooters, making noises like a hen run, or something worse. Women will be seen standing in brakes or boxes, flinging their arms and legs about as if they did not want them, trying to dance while on the move. Some will be having a dip in the briny, but owing to the bottle’s being passed round freely they will collapse and their friends will carry them on to the beach to recover. On arrival home, they will probably tell their relatives that the sea air was too strong for them. At the round-up for returning, the women will be dancing with hair and clothes hanging loose or will be seen along with the men, popping in and out to have another dance before starting, using language which cannot be printed here. All will be acting like a lot of children let loose, their actions, of course, being worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Russia, we continue to stroll around the harbor and come across a large sunshade, under which two ladies are painting the landscape. Further along we approach the beach and see the people lying back in camp chairs, while the children are playing on the b'each, just like our own children. Whoever would have thought it in Russia? According to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> this is impossible, because they harped so much about free love and that woman is nothing but a machine ; and yet I saw many families where love for each other and their children was pleasant to behold. The family tie there is just as strong and sacred as anywhere in the world. This is human nature, and there is no need for anyone to stretch his imagination the slightest degree to come to this conclusion, in spite of what' the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> says to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Going a little further along, we leave the seashore and approach the boulevards where the strains of a band attract our attention. Identically the same programs are being played as one can hear in our parks at home, with the difference that in Russia we can sit at a table and have refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immorality was forced upon many of the women under the old regime. The present government is endeavoring to lift them up out of it, and, having in mind the severe famine after the revolution, which reduced people to eating human flesh, in some instances, one is bound to admit that Russia is making astonishing progress. Undoubtedly there are many good points in Communism; but, of course, quite as many bad ones. In Christ’s kingdom they are all good: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom].” No </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mails</span><span class="font5"> or Bolshies, etc., but everyone praising God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While I enjoy your paper very much, Mr. Editor, and know that you endeavor to publish the truth, which of course is not always possible, especially in this case, I think you should know that anything concerning Russia from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font5"> point of view is one-sided and certainly not correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I remember being in Mesopotamia assisting the Russian nobility who had been driven over the Caucasus mountains by the rebels, transporting these refugees to camp at Basra, under the generosity of the British government, who were very liberal to them, making them nice and cushy [comfortable] with their wives and families. There were counts and countesses, government officials, army and naval officers, etc., all reduced to paupers, having in their possession bundles and bundles of ruble notes, which were void. To acquire a bit of hard cash, they traded their jewels, which were very valuable. It was certainly pitiful to see people who had been used to luxury-now in such circumstances and yet to find that ma</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font5">y were still arrogant and could not believe that they had lost everything, again reaping what they had sown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being invited over to dinner one evening by a family who showed me a photo of their house, which was a mansion standing in its own grounds, having gorgeous furnishings inside, my friend remarked, “Fancy leaving that to work in the British dockyard for two or three pounds a week!” This is apart from providing him with free quarters for his family, besides transporting them from the Caspian Sea and other places. Just at that moment a young officer came in and demanded to know when the British government was going to send them to South Bussia to help General Wrangel fight the Bolshevists. I replied that there were no transports available, adding that there were British Tom-mys who had been in Mesopotamia for five years, unable to get home for this reason. Judge my surprise to hear this remark, “We are not Tommys, but officers.” I said, “As far as I understand you are refugees having lost your jobs, and if that is the view you take of it, it’s a jolly good job you were driven out of Russia.” Ho did not stay to hear more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">feel convinced that Bussia is not arming for conquest, but for protection against Mr. Ratti and others who see the untouched wealth in that ■ vast continent. A big witness to the truth of the Lord’s kingdom is about due there, which will help Communists to see that their attempts to put things right are hopeless and bound to end in failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the above Kingdom is recognized and Satan’s organization swept away, then Mr. Ratti and Communists, as well as all the other ists, will have to “kiss the Son” or perish. “Thy kingdom come.” “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, . . . The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seal </span><span class="font5">of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lord of hosts</span><span class="font5"> will perform this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Oh that men would praise the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Loud</span><span class="font5"> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long-Distance Brevity </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph- Greig (Indiana)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">f]pHE Western Union Telegraph Company is-sues a code whereby patrons of that system may send their messages to any part of the world at a very nominal cost by using said code to express their sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For instance if the word “syrup” were telegraphed to a party in Africa, the agent would look up his code in Africa and hand the addressee a telegram reading: “Better remain where you are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another word is shot to China reading: “Phlox.” The cable-telegram received would therefore read: “'Market weak and active. Think you had better sell all you can at cost if you cannot do better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again: “Ounce” is telegraphed to a detective in Europe. The detective receives the cablegram reading: “Keep me well informed by mail as to your movements.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus brevity becomes very valuable in world intercourse by cable and wire, and the costs are reduced to a minimum; so that it is now possible to send, ten words of like import to the above-mentioned within the range of a couple of dollars, and at the same time carry a lengthy budget of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, mistakes sometimes occur, which makes the responsibility for correctness very important. We mention the case of Mrs. L. A. Ward, of Arkansas City, Kan., whose family were shocked when a telegram came reading: “Bernice died at 4 P.M. Arrive there Thursday.” Hence on the day the body was expected the relatives and hearse were at the station. But Bernice the sister stepped off the train very much alive. An error had been made in the telegram. The word “died” should have been “started”. Now the telegraph company is under suit as offset for the shock caused by the mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anyway this does not occur’ often; neither does it lessen the wonder of the service. Soon a new international service will be opened, when all the ends of the earth will be merged together and learn right things regarding the wonders of Jehovah’s Empire. No doubt a home screen will have flashed upon it the procedure of the golden age and the doings at Jerusalem for the benefit of all God’s creatures.</span></p>

He is a Tolstoyan from Ostrog in Horyniem, who refused to do military service when called up in October, 1927. He was forcibly enrolled in an artillery battalion and he again refused. He was court-martialed and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. After serving fourteen months he was brought before the Supreme Court and re-sentenced to five years. He writes from prison, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“1</span><span class="font5"> can never be a slave or a beast. Never shall I serve low aims.

<p><span class="font5">Protests against his treatment have been made to the Polish minister of justice by eminent people in all parts of the world, including Professor Albert Einstein, H. G. Wells, Henri Bar-busse, and by over fifty members of the British House of Commons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Myrtle</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font5">YRTLE trees grow<sup>7</sup> in abundance in the vicinity of Marshfield, Coquille and Myrtle Point, in the state of Oregon, bordering the Pacific coast at Coos Bay, and are said to grow nowhere else except in Palestine. They are properly enough first cousins to the Scripturally mentioned green bay tree of Psalm 37:35 [Authorized Version], concerning which David said, &quot;The wicked people spread themselves’ in like manner and are &quot;in strong power’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By &quot;&quot;wicked” David undoubtedly meant an element of mankind, concerning which more anon in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The myrtle tree has a bright, dark green leaf,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. A. Bohnet (Michigan)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">smooth and hard, quite similar in shape to that of the madrona tree, though much smaller, and growing somewhat parallel with its twig or limb, which is usually straight and slender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The leaf is of moderate thickness and, when crushed in its greenness, emits a disagreeable odor which instantly produces a sharp, penetrating headache of several minutes’ duration, and which nearly knocks a man down, though less pungent than the effect produced by the smelling of the leaf of the green bay tree. It is likened to strong ammonia mixed with a variety of unpleasant odors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In appearance the myrtle tree is handsome and very ornamental, especially when young. With age it assumes unsightliness, more or less. Its trunk is usually multiple and becomes knotty, gnarly and twisted. The bark is usually smooth. The wood is practically unsplittable and has to be sawed. It would do well for button-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of myrtle wood are made beautiful ornaments, such as nut and fruit dishes, bowls, cups, pipe sets, jewel cases, match holders, and other table and shelf curios, highly polished and delightfully curly-grained in variegated twistings, These ornaments are on sale in every novelty shop in the cities mentioned, and are bought and highly prized by the traveling public. Many stores display them in show windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ornamentally speaking, the myrtle has an impressive appearance. Its shape is symmetrical, and its density of foliage makes sunshine penetration impossible. Nothing can grow under a myrtle tree. It shades the ground and- saps the strength of the soil, as does the green bay tree. Its roots are long and numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are numerous groves of these showy trees along the highway to Roseburg, on the hillsides and along the creeks, growing not too close together, seeming to need ample room in which to thrive. To look at these trees, one might think that they were painstakingly trimmed by someone; for some have the form of a heart with its point upward, and others are as round as an apple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The myrtle bears a small whitish nut the size of a pea; whereas the green bay has one like an olive in size, shape and color. The full-grown tree reaches a height of thirty or forty feet, but the usual height is about ten or fifteen feet. Of course the tree bears no edible fruit. Myrtle Point is in the heart of the myrtle district. A small stream in this locality is called Myrtle Creek. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where the myrtle trees abound, there are fir, cedar, hemlock, spruce, alder and other trees in numbers. The country is hilly, and in places there are salt-water sloughs, interspersed with mountains and grazing lands. The highway from Marshfield via Coquille and Myrtle Point is partly hard-surfaced, partly of crushed stone, and is ninety miles long. The stage fare is $5.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It takes about four hours to make the stage trip, over a road which is tortuous, twisted, one as crooked as a ram’s horn, and through the finest scenery one might wish to traverse, with perfect safety amid high hills and mountains and flowery dells, not. to mention the streams and logging interests, the filling stations and the stores all along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, in what way are the wicked spreading themselves like a green bay tree and in great power? Answer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In pomp and worldly glory they make a great, showy pretense of grandeur and popularity in the eyes of onlookers. They appear handsome to the average passerby. They bear no godly fruitage. They shut out the sunlight of heavenly truth from those of humble life and saintliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They divert the rain of gospel truth from, those who are endeavoring to thrive in simplicity and reverence. They sap the vitality of earth to their own prosperity and social advancement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They establish themselves firmly to earth and earthiness and worldlinoss by their far Teachings for earthly gain, as exemplified by the numerous and lengthy roots of the typical green bay tree. Like the tree in question, they are hard-hearted, not given to Christian charity and godliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the nut of the tree is designed merely for its own propagation and ever-increasing spread and strength, so the worldly personage is given merely to the advancement of his family interests and blessedness, always wanting more of self-possession and profit, rather than to the giving of what is more blessed than is the receiving. Jesus said, “It is more, blessed to give than to receive.” He meant spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “wicked” gives none. He wants, and holds tenaciously to what he has of worldly gain and possession. This, too, is exemplified in the green bay tree. You cannot break, off any of its limbs. You must cut them; in other words, take them by force or not get them at all. You can tie a limb-of the-green bay tree into a double knot, but you cannot break it readily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rooting of the green bay tree is shallow, but very wide-spread. So is the establishment of the worldly-wise and prudent people of the earth; but, as the Apostle James declares, they shall eventually cast their ill-gotten gains into the streets; and yet shall it not deliver them. He says: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl”; for your time shall have come for settlement. And they shall have naught wherewith to settle. The Lord demands righteous deeds, not worldly gain and earthly possessions. He wants real worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not rub the ungodly too much, lest there be forthcoming a noxious smell tending to knock you out completely and causing you to regret having crumpled or ruffled them beyond their pleasure of endurance. Go easy. Stand aloof from the wicked elements unless you want to hobnob with them in their worldly environment, which does not conform with Scriptural teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The righteous, the godly, shall flourish like a palm tree, which has peculiar characteristics even more pronounced and interesting and befitting than has the green bay tree, and just the reverse. But that is another subject for consideration and analytic examination, and need not be treated in this article on the myrtle wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Myrtle wood is moderately heavy and hard, less heavy and hard than ebony, and much less hard and heavy than lignum-vitae, the hardest, heaviest and most unsplittable of all woods, a South American product and very costly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I Am a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Under the Control</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;O/&quot; HEN engaged in Christian social service, ’ ’ taking the message of God’s kingdom from door to door, one meets maaiy fine people, but occasionally is treated with utmost bitterness. A little inquiry in such cases usually elicits the information that “I am a Catholic”, but what the speakers mean is that they wish it understood that they are under the control of a Catholic priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What there is about being under the control of a Catholic priest that would make people wish to show to others that they are expected to say and do meaner things than any other people is hard to understand, but that seems to be the case. This meanness of the priests is reflected in their church papers, notably </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic News,</span><span class="font5"> of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We present below, for the information of our readers, an article from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The News</span><span class="font5"> of March 28, 1931, with a reply thereto by Judge Rutherford, dated June 30, containing some plain statements about hypocrites and liars and their ineffective attempts to estop the truth, which will be appreciated by all who are honest-hearted, truthful and courageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford Group Radio Diatribes in Paris Protested</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By M. Massiani</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Paris Correspondent, N. C. W. C. News Service)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paris, March 2.—La Croix has published a protest against the propaganda that is being broadcast by a Paris radio station known as “Radio Vitus”. Biblical talks, presented under inoffensive titles, are sent out every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. One finds that, in addition to astonishing doctrinal fantasies and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catholic”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of a Catholic Priest)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">stupefying exegesis, attacks against the Church and the Catholic clergy are broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">La Croix calls attention to the fact that these programs are organized by the International Bible Students’ Association, with headquarters presumably at Brooklyn, N. Y. It has branches at Paris, London, Vienna, Berne, Magdeburg, Warsaw, Brussels, Madrid, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo. Its president is the notorious “Judge” Rutherford, celebrated in Paris because of the humiliation he suffered the day that he attempted to hold, in the Palace of the Troca-dero, a great public gathering before which, he boasted, he would “unmask the clergy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apparently Rutherford has vast funds at his disposal, to judge from the expenses he incurs in broadcasting his propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Known for Attacks on Churches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Joseph F. Rutherford, author of the poster “Millions Now Living Will Never Die,” is a successor to the late “Pastor” Russell, founder of the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In July, 1927, over what was the greatest “hookup” in radio history up to that time and involved the first “pickup” from a point in Canada by the National Broadcasting Company, Rutherford challenged “orthodox clergy, big politicians and high financiers” as agents of Satan. He termed Christian churches as at present organized “an unholy alliance against the peoples of the earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Permission to speak, over the NBC network was the result of a statement made in the heat of an argument 'by Merlin Hall Aylesworth, president of the company. Rutherford had appeared before the Federal Radio Commission to charge that Station WJZ was operated by the National Broadcasting Company and that the latter was seeking to establish a monopoly. This followed the granting of a wave length of 454.3 meters to WJZ after it had been refused WBBR, “The Watch Tower ’ ’ from which Rutherford had been broadcasting the services of his sect since February, 1924. When Rutherford shouted at Aylesworth, ‘ ‘ I dare you to let me speak from your station,” the president of the broadcasting company retorted, “You may speak for one hour on any day and at any hour you may select. ” Rutherford selected. 3 p. m. on the following Sunday, an hour regularly sponsored by the Greater New York Federation of Churches. The Federation finally consented to give up the hour provided, but issued this notice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ATTACKS CALLED UNWARRANTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We wish it clearly understood that next Sunday’s broadcast program is in no way connected with the Federation or its affiliated churches. It was the unwarranted attack made by Judge Rutherford, before the Federal Radio Commission upon all organized churches and their clergymen, priests and rabbis, that has led the Church Federation to make this statement and to have it clearly understood that this is not the Church Federation. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1928, in the Canadian House of Commons, reasons totaling 119 typewritten pages were produced to show why the International Bible Students Association should not be permitted to broadcast in the Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Rev. Ernest Spalding, an official of the Canadian branch of the association, was fined in 1918 for distributing a book containing doctrines and passages derogatory to Great Britain and its cause in the then existent war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JUDGE RUTHERFORD’S REPLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 30, 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholic News, 33 West 60th St., New York, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sirs: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A copy of your paper of March 28 has just been received by me. Probably by now you Catholics who have been oppressing humanity for centuries can begin to see that your false statements do not pay. I went to Paris notwithstanding your libelous and untrue statements published, and held a public meeting in the large hall Pleyel on Monday the 25th of May, and the house was packed out. I never addressed a more respectful or attentive audience, and the audience expressed its approval time and again in no uncertain degree. They took away with them from that meeting more than a thousand of my books, which will enable them to understand what a crowd of hypocrites you and your associates are and have been for centuries past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time has come for the people to know the truth, and such papers as yours which have been lying day after day have about reached the end of the row so far as influencing the people is concerned. If you were honest and wanted to publish a paper for the benefit of mankind you would report the facts as they occurred. You state that I suffered humiliation in Paris when I attempted to speak in the Palace of the Troca-dero. In this you are wrong. I was not humiliated, but I saw what a bunch of hypocrites you and the clergy are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A representative of a newspaper, presumably your M. Massiani, was present and time and again interrupted the meeting, and his conduct was unbecoming a gentleman and much more unbecoming the representative of a newspaper that claims to tell the people the truth. A large number of Catholic clergymen were present, and even they became so disgusted with the newspaper man’s conduct that one of these priests came to the platform and begged the disturbers to be quiet and let me speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have no fight with the Catholic clergy or any other men. My only purpose is to tell the truth, and I well keep on telling that, and such papers as yours will not stop me for one minute. Your publication is but a further advertisement of our work, and the people will know that you are lying when they read your statement and compare it with the facts well known to those who attended the public meeting that I addressed recently in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You state that “Rutherford has vast funds at his disposal”, and in this you are right. My Father is exceedingly rich, and he is so rich that he will expose the nefarious religionists to all the world, and he won’t call upon any of you to contribute one penny toward it either. You might watch the development of things in the next few months and see whether or not your diatribes and malicious, scandalous publications misrepresenting the truth accomplish anything or not,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you were honest you would be willing to hear the other side and let the people hear, and judge for themselves, but you are not.

Be assured that the people will find you out, and that very shortly. Keep on publishing your diatribes concerning me. These help to advertise what I am doing.

<p><span class="font6">A New Covenant for the Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CpOWARD the close of the World War the constitution or covenant of the League of Nations was proposed. Centuries before Christ’s birth the sacred Scriptures prophesied of a new covenant for the nations. The covenant of the League of Nations, however, is not the fulfilment of that prophecy, even though religious enthusiasts for the League of Nations have claimed it to be &quot;the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth”. The framers and signers of that covenant never had God nor His will in mind or heart, neither the advancement of God’s kingdom on earth. Today, after more than ten years’ operation of the League covenant it has failed to bring any of the blessings promised in the new covenant. The new covenant is one* of everlasting life on earth for the people; it is one of reconciliation with God through a perfect arbitrator or mediator; it is one of the forgiveness of sins, perfect health for the sick and dying, happiness, and plenty for all the poor of the land, true liberty for the downtrodden, unending peace between all peoples without the maintenance of armies and navies for defense against wars of aggression, and even deliverance from the bars of the grave for all who have died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League covenant, as long as it continues, means only prolonged sickness, dying, and death for the people; it cannot keep the people from dying; much less can it restore back from the grave even one of the millions of the poor innocents who laid down their lives as a preliminary to the covenant of the League. This international compact will go; it must go, for divine prophecy declares that it shall be broken to pieces. If God’s prophecy does not mean that the members of the League will get at violent odds with one another and break it up of themselves, then it means that God himself through His chief executive, Jesus Christ, will smash it up. Only thus can the prophecies be explained. (Ps. 2:8,9; Rev. 2:27) This utter abolition of the League and its covenant Jesus will accomplish in “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, popularly called “the battle of Armageddon”, and which is now nearer than the nations and people think. (Matt. 24:38,39) Immediately after the magnificent triumph 'which Jehovah God will get himself through Christ Jesus in that battle, the new covenant for the nations will be inaugurated. Many may, by folio vang God’s counsel in His holy Word, live through that battle to witness the beginning of that blessed covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new covenant is “new”, not in the sense that it takes the place of the League covenant. The fact is, the new covenant was made upon the basis of an adequate surety nineteen hundred years ago at Jesus’ crucifixion. For that reason the second grand division of the Bible has been regularly called “The Nerv Testament”. The new “testament” and the new “covenant” mean the same thing, for both expressions translate the same original Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible. “Covenant” means a coming together in agreement, a contract, a disposing. Although definitely made nineteen centuries ago, yet this particular covenant is a new one in the sense that it displaces an ancient or old one made over sixteen centuries previously. One of the inspired writers of the New Testament says: “If that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with them [the Jews], he [God] saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant ... In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.” (Heb. 8: 7, 8,13) The new covenant, you may be sure, is not an international agreement, made between the nations of earth after the close of the World War or at any time prior thereto. Such a covenant would only be a covenant between nations, erstwhile enemies but all a part of the one great visible organization of Satan the Devil, “the prince of this world.” Contracts between members of the Devil’s organization bring selfish benefits to the contracting parties, but do injury to a third party, the people. The efforts now being made to control international trusts and cartels prove this to be true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The contracting parties to the new covenant are Jehovah, the only true God, on the one side, and the arbitrator or mediator whom Jehovah has appointed and accepts for the other side. This mediator’ acts in behalf of the people or nation which God chose in connection with the old covenant, and then acts through this people or nation in behalf of the peoples of all the nations of earth. The first clear prophecy of this new testament or covenant is found in Jeremiah’s writings, chapter thirty-one, verses thirty-one to thirty-four inclusive. This prophecy shows that no group of international politicians would either propose or ffiaBfe this new covenant, but that it originates in the mind of the Almighty God, Jehovah, the Most High, and that it is His love and mercy which cause it to come into existence and operation. God is also the One who decides whom to invite into the covenant as of the party on the other side of the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophecy opens, saying: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant.” At the time of this prophecy the old covenant was still in force; but God foreknew that He would abolish it at a definite future day. With whom, then, will God make this new arrangement'? With the members of this present so-called “political expression of the kingdom of God on earth”? No! God’s prophecy answers: “With the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord.” God’s own utterance declares that this new contract will be “not according to”, hence </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font5"> from, the old one. Nevertheless, other scriptures show that the old covenant, in the manner of drawing it up and inaugurating it, is a prophetic pattern or picture of the new covenant. The points of correspondency are interesting to note. Many of these points, being already matters of fulfilled prophecy, are unshakable guarantees that in the lifetime of millions of people now living the glorious new covenant will become operative and valid toward our sorely distressed and dying race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hebrews, or Jews, were and are members of the family of Adam. Hence, due to Adam’s rebellion against God’s law in the garden of Eden, death, imperfection, and sin have been inherited by Jews as well as Gentiles. (Rom. 5: 12) How would they, or could they, gain life? Not life in heaven, but on earth, and that for ever, and with all the things that human heart and mind and body could desire and enjoy to the glory of God. God pointed them to the way thereto, and opened up that way for them. Sixteen centuries before Christ they were down south in the land of Egypt, not as a free and independent people, but slaving their lives away for a devilish Pharaoh and his conscienceless ring of princely politicians, grain brokers and moneyed commercial men, military commanders with their chariots and horses and armies, and priests and magicians. God raised up a champion of the true worship of the true God and of freedom for the oppressed, namely, Moses. Not consulting even Moses, but deciding to do the act of His own loving-kindness, God finally issued instructions to His servant Moses to lay the sacrificial basis for a covenant with the enslaved Jews. Thereby the Jews should gain their freedom from the Devil’s organization in Egypt, and become God’s servants, and also, if they kept the terms of the covenant, gain everlasting life in a land “flowing with milk and honey, which is the chief of all lands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sacrificial basis for that covenant was a lamb “without blemish”, slain there in the land of Egypt on the night of the Passover. The mediator between God and the people of Israel was the prophet Moses. He was the one whom God used to issue regulations as to how their lives w’ould be spared or passed over by virtue of the blood of the Passover lamb, and how they would immediately thereafter be led out of Egypt, a people redeemed by Jehovah God. In the fulfilment of these prophetic pictures, God sent down Christ Jesus from heaven into this world, even as He had formerly sent Moses into Egypt, and Jesus offered himself as “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. Jesus was literally slain in Satan’s world at the Passover season of the Jews. Hence the people of earth may hope to gain life through the new covenant because they have been redeemed “with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot”.-—1 Pet. 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the value of Jesus’ blood that makes valid that new covenant or testament. For this reason, at His last earthly supper, Jesus took a cup of wine as symbolizing His blood, and said to His eleven faithful apostles, “Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.” (Matt. 26: 27,28) In carrying out this priestly office of offering sacrifice for mankind’s sins, Jesus became Mediator in behalf of sinful mankind, who of themselves never could approach unto God and enter into a treaty with Him. So it is written: “There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all.” (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6) Jesus has given himself a ransom for all, whether they be dead or alive; accordingly all members of the human family, whether now dead or Hving, must and will have the privilege of receiving the benefits of the new covenant when it is inaugurated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jews had hoped that by keeping the ten commandments and the other provisions of the covenant through Moses they would acquire title to eternal life on earth. The Apostle Paul s</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">um</span><span class="font5">s up the result of their efforts, saying: “The commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.” (Rom. 7:10,11) How foolish then for anyone to hail the League of Nations as the savior of the world, as was done by the religious leaders in A. D. 1919 and thereafter! The blood of the Passover lamb of the Jews, or the blood of all their other animal sacrifices, could not possibly take away their sins, and it was the removal of their sinfulness that was needful, because it was their sinfulness and imperfection that kept them from fulfilling the ten commandments and the other requirements of God’s covenant. Likewise, men’s efforts today to justify themselves before God and thus to gain life by trying to keep the ten commandments or by this hypocritical sham of so-called “character development” are all vain. If the Jews, or any other nation, are to inherit everlasting life on this earth, this old covenant through Moses must be done away, and a new and better covenant, established on a better and perfect sacrifice that really takes away sin, must be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has made this all-necessary provision, for His inspired Word testifies, saying: “By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament [covenant].” “Now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.” “And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, . . . for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> reading] 'where a covenant exists, the death of that which has ratified it is necessary to be produced; because a covenant is firm over dead victims, since not even the first [covenant] has been instituted without blood.” (Heb. 7: 22; 8:6; 9:15-18) At His death on the tree Jesus abolished the old Mosaic covenant, freeing the Jews from its obligations, even though dowm to this day Jews do not realize it. Thus Jesus was instrumental (as the Apostle Paul states it) in ‘blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to [the tree]”. (Col. 2:14) However, Jesus died as “the Lamb of God” long centuries ago. Why then is it that the people have continued to die during all the Christian era and are still dying? Many men, failing to get a true answer to this question from the clergy, have turned sour against the Bible and scoff at the atoning sacrifice of Christ Jesus the Mediator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible’s answer is this: That whereas the sacrifice of Jesus was essential as a preliminary and as a basi s to the covenant, yet the kingdom of God audits establishment are most important of all. Jesus sounded the keynote when He gave His disciples the prayer: “Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” The peoples of earth need to be delivered from the kingdom of Satan, which was symbolized by the autocratic kingdom of Pharaoh of Egypt in Moses’ day. Satan’s world must be brought to an end, and “the prince of this world”, the Devil, who is also “the god of this world”, must be bound and his power in heaven and earth paralyzed. The sprinkling of the blood of Jesus “the Lamb of God” indeed takes away the sin of the world in order that the people of the world may have a resurrection from the dead and a clean slate before God when the new covenant goes into operation. But it is God’s kingdom alone that can destroy the Devil’s organization that has ever galled mankind; it is God’s Kingdom that will exercise the power to bind Satan and the wicked angels and men on earth who serve him and thus to bring mankind forth from bondage under Satan’s world system into the “land flowing with milk and honey”, Paradise restored to this earth. It is God’s kingdom that will inaugurate the new covenant, for God’s anointed King is the Mediator thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new covenant was made at Jesus’ death on earth, but that was not God’s set time to' establish His kingdom and inaugurate the covenant. At that time the Jews were in no fit condition to enter the new covenant with God, for they demanded the crucifixion of the very one ■who is the Mediator of that covenant, and their children unto this present time have never accepted Him as their Savior. The setting in motion of the covenant must wait until the kingdom of God is reached. That is vzhy the nations of earth, aside from the comparatively few genuine Christians, have received no benefits as yet from Jesus’ 'death, but men continue to die and to drudge and slave and sweat and finally collapse under Satan’s beastly world organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This very futurity of the covenant’s institution was foreshadowed in God’s dealing with the Jews. Although the old covenant was made, as God says, “in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt,” yet it was not until “in the third month” thereafter, when they had reached Mount Sinai, in the desert of Arabia, that God inaugurated that covenant, and sacrificial blood was used to confirm it. (Ex. 19-24; Heb. 9:18-20) Likewise in the fulfilment of this prophetic picture. Mount Sinai, the ancient mountain of God, foreshadowed the kingdom of God, which kingdom is also symbolized by Mount Zion in the Holy Land; as it is written: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” Mankind, and particularly the little band of genuine and faithful Christians, have had to journey from the time of Jesus’ death through the weary centuries of the Christian era and down to this day to reach God’s mountain or kingdom. And now the kingdom of God is reached, since A. D. 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Writing prophetically for the benefit of Christians today, the Apostle Paul compares Mount Sinai to God’s kingdom, or Mount Zion, and says: “For ye are not come unto the mount [Sinai], . . . but ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city [government] of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, . . . and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. . . . Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. . . . Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” —Heb. 12:18-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In A. D. 1914 “the times of the Gentiles”, as Jesus called them, ended, and the time for God’s kingdom through Christ came. The systems of rulership of this earth have been considerably shaken since then, even as Mount Sinai was mightily shaken and a fearful commotion occurred when God inaugurated the old covenant through Moses. But the shake-up of Satan’s organization in heaven and earth is not yet over. The final, terrific shaking, which God will give to that organization at the battle of Armageddon now so near, will make it reel worse than a drunkard and will shatter' it and for ever remove it from the bowed backs of humankind, and the people W’ill go free, yes, free for ever from Satan’s dominion. And then, too, God through Jesus the Mediator will confirm the new covenant in heaven, and the laws thereof will be proclaimed to the uttermost nooks of our globe, and the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the great deep. All nationalities shall be brought to a knowledge of the terms of that covenant; even the dead nations shall be brought from the graves to obtain this knowledge and benefit thereby unto life eternal in human perfection on earth.—1 Tim. 2:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Describing the institution of this life-giving contract and its benefits to the peoples God’s prophecy declares: “This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.” Other scriptures indicate that the term ‘Israel’ here applies to God’s faithful witnesses of ancient times, who were truly ‘Israelites inwardly, namely, the devoted prophets of God from Abel down to and including John the Baptist. These will be brought back to earth as perfect men, and be made ‘princes in all the earth’, and will treat with Jesus the Mediator in behalf of fleshly Israel, the Jews, and all other nations, for all of whom the “Lamb of God” gave himself a ransom. The prophecy continues: “After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”—Jer. 31: 31-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this provision of the new covenant means, as we say, “heaven on earth” for the people. It means remission of sins that are past, harmony with God, never-ending “peace on earth”, resurrection for the dead, and glorious life and health in God’s image and likeness for all mankind on earth; and God’s name hallowed, and His will done on earth as it is done above in heaven. Only those refusing to render allegiance to God’s kingdom which backs up this new covenant, and refusing to hear and obey the Mediator, Jesus, the greater Prophet than Moses, will be annihilated in perpetual destruction, &quot;the second death.” For the Apostle Peter, quoting God’s own -words from the Old Testament, says: “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time behooves all people, therefore, to turn from all earthly, human compacts, covenants and leagues, and turn themselves to earth’s new King, the great Mediator of the new covenant.</span></p>

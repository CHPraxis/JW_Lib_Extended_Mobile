<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">CONEE county, S. C., has been fined $2,000 for the lynching of a colored man. The money goes to the family of the poor man that lost his life at the hands of the mob. Abundant evidence exists that the mob lynched the wrong man. The lynchers went scot free, as is the custom in America w’hen w’hite men put innocent colored men to death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font5">RIENDS of the Negroes and lovers of justice point out that the prevailing crime wave has had little or no effect upon the Negroes of the South, and that in the exclusively Negro city of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, the jail has been torn down to make room for an office building because it has not had a prisoner for two years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">APAN is expecting to lower the age limit of men voters from twenty-five to twenty years of age.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conservatism in Norway</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TN THE recent elections in Norway the radical labor groups suffered a reduction in the number of seats which they control in the national parliament. The non-Socialist parties made a gain of some 200,000 votes, but the gain of the conservatives was not sufficient to give them control of the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TA ESPITE all her economic and other troubles in recent years, one of her best known economists, Sir Josiah Stamp, has calculated that Great Britain’s wealth has increased about $19,000,000,000 since the outbreak of the World War. In other words, Britain’s present net 'wealth is set at about $90,225,000,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">NLY a few months ago we read with horror that parents in Chinn were, giving their children away, being no longer able to provide them with food. Now we get the information that small farmers of Albemarle, Greene and Rockingham counties, Virginia, in the heart of last summer’s drouth section, are doing the same thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N SPITE of all the singing and whistling, it is apparent that the people are losing confidence in some of their financial institutions, and that some banks are losing confidence in themselves. In one day recently 51 banks in the South closed their doors, among them the largest bank in Louisville, Ky. Of the 51 banks, 43 were located in Arkansas, mostly in one chain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">TANDING in a bull ring at Madrid, in front of 16,000 people, and also in front of a microphone, Senor Alcala Zamora, Spanish republican leader, took pains to tell King Alfonso that there will shortly be a republic in Spain and that the best thing he can do is to get out of the country while the getting is good. Since then Madrid has had a,general strike; but Alfonso was still there, at last reports.</span></p>

Before they get through with it all the statesmen of the world must come to the same conclusion. The only possible hope of the world is in the kingdom which is from above, God’s kingdom, Christ’s kingdom, forcibly intervening in human affairs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font5">MAN in Oklahoma City found a tomato plant growing in his yard last spring. He did not know where it came from, or wdio planted it.

<p><span class="font5">ADHERE are opportunities for fame and for-®- tune in the smelting of beryllium. There are mountains of the ore in Austria and Africa, and quantities of it in the state of Maine, but no practical way to smelt it has yet been found. It is believed this way will yet be found, and that, it will make beryllium the ideal metal for airplane construction, because of its great strength and its lightness.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Lions Dangerous Even as Dummies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">TN A parade in London students carried a dummy lion. As soon as it was observed by the live elephants in the parade the elephants took to their heels and -went crashing into a crowd of people, seven of whom were injured. The elephants were headed back into line by the mounted police, after sniffing at the broken fragments of the lion.</span></p>

None of the Allied engineers were ever able to figure out how a gun could have such a tremendous range, and each one of the Germans who knew’ refused to tell, even when threatened with death. A tablet has recently been, erected at the spot where the gun stood. Its location was finally figured out by mathematicians and astronomers, in itself a -wonderful achievement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">FTER trying for months to obtain a job to provide food for himself and four motherless children, Joseph Drusin stole a loaf of bread from a neighbor’s kitchen, out near Pittsburgh. When the neighbor wanted to know<sup>7</sup> what he was doing in her kitchen he shamefacedly laid down the bread. When she had him arrested he went to his cellar and hanged himself. He could not figure it out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5"> FAVORITE trick of beggars in Chicago is what is called ‘‘'crust-planting”. A beggar plants crusts of bread, and then, when a crowd arrives, he -will rush up, find the crusts, grab them and begin to greedily devour them. As he walks away someone in the crowd is likely to give him a dollar, and in a day he makes better ■wages at this kind of work than if engaged in an honest occupation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">R</span><span class="font5">ACKETEERING is the organization, by a gang, of the wholesale distribution of some commodity. The gang gains control of the commodity, raises the price, and forces the retailer to accept the increase. If he refuses lie is bombed or beaten up, and after a short time is ready to pass the increase on to the consumer. The Power Trust is essentially a gang of racketeers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Burglary Business Getting Unsafe</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE burglary business in Buffalo is getting unsafe. A woman telephoned to the police that she believed a burglary -was being committed. Headquarters sent out a radio alarm to a flying squad equipped with a receiving apparatus. The police drove up to the door and caught the man hard at work on a safe with an electric drill. Hereafter when he goes to work at his trade he will have to take a radio set along, and that is inconvenient.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">npiIERE is now approaching completion in Dallas, Texas, a nineteen-story skyscraper which was put up without the use of rivets. All the joints were electrically welded. The claim is made that this form of construction requires less material, and less expense in preparing the material, and increases speed of construction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE next man about to pass out of existence is the railroad switchman. On a forty-mile stretch of track in California one man seated at a table now throws the switches for all the trains within that district. Moreover, he sees before him, traced with automatic pen, the progress of each train. The installation of this new device has done away with several way stations and telegraph offices.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Hamilton (Ontario) jail is a queer kind of jail, run by a queer kind of people. An old man, 72 years of age, came there, stating that he had no friends or relatives, was no longer able to provide for himself, and wanted to be sent to jail, where he would be sheltered and fed. The Hamilton police found he was entitled to an old-age pension, kept him until he got it, and then turned him loose, an independent and appreciative citizen.</span></p>

These rates are shortly to be changed in favor of the wealthy. Poor people will have to pay more, but the rich people will be able to get it for less. This system of robbery is worked out by making service charges for the use of a small amount of current, the theory being that those who can afford to use but a small amount of current should be penalized.

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS literally true m this day that ‘one shall chase a thousand, and two shall put ten thousand to flight’, and this is about what happened at Montpelier, Indiana, where the local board of salaried theologians used their influence with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font5"> to persuade the people not to buy or to read Judge Rutherford’s books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a report of the Indianapolis Bible Student who had this village in hand we quote some interesting paragraphs, of the happenings when the village was recently covered with copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> containing the Montpelier article, one copy in every house in town. The lady says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon entering this little town of about 2,500 people, we went to work immediately. I had called upon but two homes when, to my surprise, the Mr. Law, the minister who attacked me two months ago, came out of the third one. After going a few doors in the next block I again saw this minister coming up a side street. He seemed very nervous and hurried and looked at me scrutinizingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again, when working the business section, all three of the clergymen appeared, this time driving slowly and gazing fixedly at me. A little later, as this part of the town was finished, I looked up, to see Mr. Law going up a side street, and looking back as if in great fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the work progressed the people received me gladly. They criticized the clergy and politicians in general, and said that Montpelier contained the most rotten bunch on the face of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you will recall, our work of canvassing Montpelier was finished on the evening when the attack upon us came out. On that occasion only one order was canceled. This man treated me very unkindly, although when I originally canvassed him he had not been in alignment with either the clergy or the politicians. When I called at his door and handed him </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> he said, “Lady, I am sorry I treated you the way I did; I have many faults; I wish I had taken those books and not been influenced. You have told the truth in this whole matter and you can send me the books C.O.D. I am going to read them. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My last </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> was reserved for the editor of the Montpelier </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span><span class="font4"> He had already received his copy from Jacob Mayer, of Altoona, Pa. He was terribly excited as he mentioned Mr. Mayer’s name. He admitted that he was not a Christian, but a man of the world, and agreed that the churches are more commercial than Christian. He also stated that Mr. Chastain did not want his name added to the list of clergymen, but when they called he was not at home, and they added his name anyway, for which he was very sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This last item is rich, for it shows that when a board of hypocrisy gets in motion it will stop at nothing. A little thing like forgery or misrepresentation is nothing at all. The people of Montpelier seem to have sized up the situation about right.

<p><span class="font5">The forty-two chapters into which the book is divided give the high lights of history of the great city which lies at the edge of the Sea of Verrazano. (Just wdiere that Sea of Verrazano is located nobody has yet been able to ascertain from the map which Girolamo da Verrazano made after the initial exploration of New York harbor by Girolamo’s brother Giovanni in the year 1524.) The book contains thirty-nine illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the book are fifty pages of chronology; not the kind Bible Students ■were wont to be interested in, but the kind in wdiich historians of New York city love to revel. The end of this chronology is, appropriately, the breaking of ground in 1929 for the construction at 40 Wall Street of “the tallest office building in the world”, to occupy most of the block bounded by Wall, William, Nassau and Pine Streets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The rushing waters which travelers between New York and New England know as Hell Gate were originally known on a Dutch chart of New York harbor by a name which suggests Ilorl-Gat, or channel of the whirlpool. In 1885 the last nine acres of jagged rock which went to make up this deadly reef Avere blown to atoms and crumbled into the mine beneath which had been patiently hollowed out to receive them. Hell Gate still appears on the map, but it is now an innocent place, compared Avith what it was w’hen Captain Adrian Block first pushed his little vessel past its dangers on his way to discover the island off the coast of Connecticut which bears his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everybody in Brooklyn knows where the Brooklyn Navy Yard is located. It is plainly visible from all the adjacent Brooklyn bridges, two of which are on one side of it and two on the other. Its location was once called Wallabout Bay. It bears that name because, when thirty families of persecuted Belgian Calvinists, called “Walloons”, came to join the Dutch colonists, the Dutch located them where the buildings of the navy yard now stand and called the place “T-Wale-Bocht”, or “Bay of the Foreigners”, because, forsooth, Belgians are foreigners to Hollanders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would you like to know how Americans came to know the taste of that delicious conspirator against digestion known as the cruller ? It is all very simple. The marriage clerk of the little Dutch community was also the village’s official comforter of the sick; his name, Sebastian Krol. His wife knew how to make these delicious little cakes, and so, when he went to call on the sick, he took 'with him, to comfort them, a supply of his wife’s delicious “Krolyers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How many millions of railroad tickets have led to or through Yonkers on the New’ York Central route from New York to Chicago and points west Ave will not even attempt to guess. It seems that the land where the Hudson River city now stands was once granted to Adrian Van der Donck, a young Dutch lord. On account of his youth his estate came to be knowm as the “Young Lord’s Land” and, in Dutch, that is “Yonkheer’s Landt”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not know’ wdiat has become of the pond on the edges of which Adam Roelantsen, New<sup>7 </sup>York’s first school teacher, had his bleaching ground, where, for a small sum, the Dutch maidens dried the family linens in the sun. The bleaching ground has gone too. In its place are skyscrapers. But the lane by Avhieh the girls went down to the bleachery is still intact, and is called Maiden Lane to this day. Once it was the jevcelry center of the Western world, but, like everything else in New York, the wholesale jew’elry business has moved uptowm and is now in 47th and 48th Streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course you have heard of the Bowery. Well, every Dutch farm is or w’as a Bouwerie. One such Avas Nut Island, purchased from the Indians for the use of Wouter Van TAviller. As Mr. Van Twiller happened to be the governor of the little Dutch colony, AA<sup>T</sup>e now call his old farm by the name Governor’s Island. And you have heard of that too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Indians used to find plenty of rabbits on an island off the low<sup>T</sup>er edge of Long Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They called these handsome little creatures </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">conynges,</span><span class="font5"> and the island came to be called Co-nynge Island. The “iron” steamboats run there regularly now, as well as'the elevated and subway trains, trolleys, and automobiles by the million. The rabbits have long since disappeared, but occasionally some Indians still visit Coney Island, now sometimes playfully called “Cohens’ Island”. In fact it is also quite a favorite resort for the Tammany chieftains and their tribesmen whose wigwams cover the face of Manna-Hatin Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">English families came and settled in and around New York harbor. For instance, there was the Pell family, and one can hardly get from New York to any New England point without going through their old farm.

<p><span class="font5">When a band of Dutch farmers moved over to Long Island and broke ground for a new lot of farms they called the locality by the Dutch name which means “'broken ground”. That Dutch name of “Breuckelen” we still have with us, and our printing presses today are running in what was once one of the old farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Dutch spread to the north there came a time w’hen one of them, more courageous and energetic than the others, crossed over a river well known to all New Yorkers and settled in what is now<sup>7</sup> Bronx borough. Jonas Bronck has handed his name down to one of the most populous districts of New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It w<sup>r</sup>as not so nice to have the cows wandering all over the growing village, so, on the northern edge of the town the Dutch residents of New Amsterdam built a fence to keep them out. Later, when the Indians threatened the town, this fence was made into a stout blockade or wall. You have heard about the street that was built along beside it, no doubt. Today it is called Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WTien the time came to place a village on the upper shores of Manhattan Island, twenty-five families -were sent at one time, and their little settlement was named after a town in Holland, Haarlem. If you have ever lived in New York you know something about Harlem. Today it is the greatest Negro city in the world, but all a part of Greater New York. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New York has always been a cosmopolitan city. It is said that by the year 1660 eighteen languages were spoken on the streets of New Amsterdam. Wonder just how many languages and dialects are spoken there now. It must be away up into the hundreds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite a good way out on Long Island, years ago, was a little Indian beaver pond, or what the Indians called a “Jameco”. We do not know wdiat has become of the pond. Quite probably<sup>7 </sup>it is covered from end to end with the apartment houses or other homes that now go to make up the important district we New Yorkers know as Jamaica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You have wondered how it is that Staten Island, lying snugly<sup>7</sup> up against the shores of New Jersey<sup>7</sup>, happens to be in New York state. It would not have been so placed had not Captain Charles Billop taken advantage of the agreement made -between the authorities of the two states that New York was to have all the islands in the harbor that could be circumnavigated in twenty-four hours. Nobody supposed that Billop could do in his sloop, the “Bentley”, what he managed to do. Today a fast motor boat w<sup>7</sup>ould go around it in an hour (but it would have to be a fast one).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New<sup>7</sup> York’s curb market. Oh, y<sup>7</sup>es. That used to meet each Friday morning at the bridge over the Heere Gracht, or Gentleman’s Canal, which then flowed dowm w’hat is now<sup>7</sup> Broad Street. The canal is long since gone from the memory of all except historians, but the curb market still meets at Broad Street, in the same location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ilog Island. You probably never heard of it by that name. 'When you heard of it it was called Blackwell’s Island, named after Robert Blackwell, but it still had a bad name. You knew<sup>7</sup> of it as the location of New<sup>7</sup> York’s gloomy prisons. Today the authorities call it Welfare Island. It is a better name for what seems always to have been an. island of unhappiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The little book gives us a good story of the piracies of Captain Kidd. It seems that this w<sup>7</sup>orthy gentleman sailed the seas under the king’s seal, and that King William had a share of the profits when other pirates were captured and the booty<sup>7</sup> seized. Captain Kidd got along all right until his crew mutinied, and w<sup>7</sup>hen that happened, and the black flag was raised, it cost him his head. King William w<sup>?</sup>as glad to see him go, because he knew altogether too much of how<sup>7 </sup>some of the funds found their w<sup>7</sup>ay into the royal treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bowling Green, for long maintained as a public bowling ground, w<sup>7</sup>as rented for one peppercorn per year to Jolin Chambers, Peter Bayard and Peter Jay. Before that time it was the open space before the walls of the fort of New Amsterdam. The United States Custom House stands upon it now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The unfortunates committed to its dreary hold learned to expect no mercy. By day they were permitted to crawl about the decks, if disease and starvation had left them sufficient strength, but by night they were herded into the filth and darkness below, and sentries who guarded the single narrow grating that admitted air to the hold often amused themselves by thrusting their bayonets between the bars at the struggling, gasping victims. Provost Cunningham’s proud boast that he had caused the death of more Yankees than had any battle was probably no idle one, for no less than eleven thousand bodies are said to have been carried away in the death-carts that rumbled daily through the streets of New York, and the guard’s morning call at the grating was “Rebels, turn out your dead! ’ ’ The bodies were often dumped in shallow ditches along the Brooklyn shore, where each tide uncovered human bones. Only in recent years were these tenderly gathered up from the simple tomb originally erected by the Tammany Society near the shore, to find a suitable resting place in the Martyr’s Tomb at Fort Greene Park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Morrisania, so we are told, was named after Gouverneur Morris. Brooklyn Heights, i. e., Columbia Heights, was at one time considered as a possible site for the federal capital. It Avas reserved for a much greater honor, having to do with, the government of the whole earth, the earthly headquarters of the Lord’s kingdom now functioning in our midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tammany, with a reputation none too good, was named after Tammenand, a Delaware brave, and was organized with the avowed intention of offsetting the aristocratic tendencies of the officers of the Revolutionary army, formed into the Society of the Cincinnati. Its efforts as an anti-patriotic organization seem to have been almost unbroken since that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first Stock Exchange met in 1790 under a spreading button-wood tree that then stood at about what is now No. 68 Wall Street. In two years its membership had grown to twenty-four and definite agreements about trading had been drawn up between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">American newspaper enterprise, including The Associated Press, is traced directly to James Gordon Bennett, one of the most progressive men that ever lived. Bennett scoured the world for news, and got it too, and readers as well. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font5"> in his day, was the greatest real newspaper in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great American Railway Express' business traces back to the year 1839, when William Harnden in one great carpet bag began carrying packages back and forth between New York and Boston. It seems difficult to believe that so great a business could have had so small a beginning such a short time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It makes the heart beat loudly to read once again about the sweetest of all sweet singers, the Swedish nightingale, Jenny Lind. When she sang the Negro melodies before the Civil War, she sang to not a dry eye in the house. No auditoriums were large enough to hold her audiences. At her opening concert in Castle Garden, Phineas T. Barnum packed the house at $225 a seat. She was a tremendous factor against human slavery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">T THE rate we have been going in the last few years we are soon going to have two government employees for every one who works and produces in the United States, and about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iy<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font5"> of them are going to be medical men. Medical men and medical societies have ceased to be unbiased, open-minded, investigating bodies, and have now developed into thoroughly aggressive, political organizations, proposing always stricter medical laws for their own exclusive benefit, no matter what harm is done to the people at large, and unless you people wake up, you are going to see the time when you will be waked up in the morning, with a medical man at your door, telling you this is the time to take your shot of something or other, some sort of dirty soup, or be vaccinated with some kind of new pus they have gotten out to ward off or prevent something or other, they know not what; and they don’t know themselves what they are using on you half the time, but they have a vague, indefinite theory, and they are going to try it out on you wholesale first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A professor of the medical staff of Leland Stanford University is going to have a fine time for the next two or three years studying such glandular conditions as he may find among prisoners in various states. Some pretty soft, easy job these medical boys fall into. I vmnt to tell you that ninety-nine out of every hundred people, and I think that is putting it below<sup>7</sup> what it really is, do not have properly functioning glands. Do you think you could have a properly functioning automobile if you put kerosene in the crank case instead of lubricating oil? Are you foolish enough to think you can put' lubricating oil in the gas tank and have your automobile operate satisfactorily? Could you put gasoline in the radiator and get very many miles with your automobile without trouble?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Well, don’t you think you ought to use the same common sense in running your human machine as you w<sup>r</sup>ould in running an automobile? Do you think you can keep your body in good health by putting into your human gas tank a foodless food like white flour, baked up in various forms of cake and cookies and pastries with white sugar? Both of these so-called foods, being acid-forming, cause a fer-. mentation and will drain from your body all the mineral salts needed for proper nourishment. How can you expect to keep your body in good physical condition -when you eat devitalized foods in the first place, and then when you mix them in combinations, which are in violation of the Creator’s laws of physiology, and when such mixtures create fermentation and putrefaction so that you are constantly absorbing acid-toxic Siaterial into your blood, and having it deposited all through your flesh until you break down your bodies ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How can you expect the various endocrine glands of your body to function properly when the blood with which those glands should be nourished and made efficient is lacking in the twelve mineral salts, without which you can have no health? How can you expect the glands of your body to work to their fullest capacity and furnish to the blood the endocrine secretions that maintain the endocrine balance through the body when that blood is poisoned 'with acid-toxic poison, just as I might poison, you by shooting some strychnine and morphine into your arm with a hypodermic needle? If I did that, you would know or should know that it would put your brain, your nervous system and every gland in your body more or less out of commission, depending upon the size of the dose I gave you. So it is by the bad habits of living generally indulged in these days that people are poisoning themselves all the time, until they become less efficient mentally and physically, and the endocrine balance of the body is broken down and disturbed by one and another of the glands breaking dorni through lack of nourishment and poisoning from poisoned, acid-toxic blood. Then wdiat would seem to be the first thing to do, the common sense thing to do ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wouldn’t it seem a most reasonable proposition to get the poison out of the body and then to begin to nourish that body with such food as would carry into it the mineral salts, the vita-mines and the nourishment necessary to supply every need of the body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Always, Nature has restored and will restore to proper functioning every gland and every cell in your body when it is properly nourished with clean blood. The problem you have before you is to learn how to nourish your body. You will have to learn how to take care of your human machine, and most of you pay less attention to your priceless human body than you do to any old automobile.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Vaccination</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">In the city of Leicester, vaccination and revaccination was carried on, and finally they had the worst kind of epidemic of smallpox, and the people were so angry to think they had been hoodwinked into all of this vaccination business, and in spite of it, having such an outbreak of smallpox, that the town eh masse refused after that to be vaccinated, and they have not had any smallpox in Leicester since, except what wms brought in from the outside, and that being immediately isolated, all spread of the disease was prevented, until Leicester is one great English town where they do not have smallpox, and they are not vaccinated, except a very small percentage of them, anti yet the people have the privilege of being vaccinated there if they want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kansas City had an epidemic of smallpox in November and December, 1921, at least it was so alleged by thp medical trust doctors of Kansas City. The Advertisers’ Protective Bureau said they didn’t have an epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I want you to know that the Advertisers’ Protective Bureau of Kansas City, affiliated with the National Vigilance Committee and the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, investigated this so-called epidemic at Kansas City, and I want you to hear some of their conclusions. This advertising organization investigated the number of smallpox cases in other towns in Missouri at the time the epidemic was declared, and found many of them with a very much higher percentage of smallpox cases than there were in Kansas City, yet no epidemic was declared in those towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report says: “In continuing our investigation, we asked several health and medical authorities whether an epidemic condition was justified and could be so advertised when onesixteenth of one percent of the population were afflicted, or one to every 1,600 of population. Unanimously the answer was, ‘No.’ It was then shown that this was the percentage during the height of the affliction here.” In the light of the above comparison, was there justification for the general reign of terror which existed in this city and throughout our trade territory when it was reported on all sides that a smallpox epidemic existed here? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Was there justification for the stupendous loss of trade and business during the holiday season due to the unfavorable publicity in the trade territory which inspired fear in the minds of the shoppers throughout the country districts and kept them at home? Was there justification for the falling off in transportation and interurban business, for the enormous loss to the city from cancellations of conventions and business meetings of all kinds ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Was there justification for eastern traveling men in wiring to correspondents here that they ■would not make the territory for fear of the epidemic? Was there justification for keeping thousands of regular visitors from their annual home-comings with relatives and friends here during the holiday season? Was there justification for the rumors throughout the territory that people were being forcibly taken off trains and vaccinated and that people were -dying in the streets?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the policy of this bureau to deal only in facts. This policy underlies the bureau’s work as a quasi-public institution in its mission of suppressing for the benefit of the public, fraudulent and misleading advertising or publicity. Its established policy of gathering facts and reliable information has guided the bureau in endeavoring to ferret out the causes underlying the declaration of the existence of a smallpox epidemic last fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The facts seem to be that health conditions just before the “epidemic” were favorable, from the less than 50 percent hospital attendance, the small list of contagious cases on record at the health office (see list), and the fact that Dr. E. H. Bullock, health officer, felt the time opportune to take his annual vacation. We learned also that medical practitioners had fewer cases, and were not overrun with calls. The extremely mild fall and ■winter weather, with little moisture, brought w<sup>T</sup>ith it less of the prevailing colds and la grippe attacks incident to this time of the year. We learned, in short, that the city’s health was so good that not much effori wms needed to make it better, and a sort of dullness pervaded the medical field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sudden calling of the epidemic and the attendant publicity changed all this. Every medical practitioner in the city found his hands full with vaccinating patients, both at the office and in the homes. Unofficial estimates place the number of paid vaccinations (as distinguished from free vaccinations of school children and at health centers), at 200,000, for which it is alleged fees ranging from 25 cents up to $5.00 each were charged. An estimated average fee of $2.50 would yield an aggregate of half a million dollars expended by the public of Kansas City during this period for vaccination alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides the vaccination expenditure many people suffered from the after effects of vaccination, some of them severely. For these, medical attention was required, in soiiw instances, over a period of months, with added expenditure. Besides, there were numbers who, from reading of the epidemic, imagined they had the symptoms of smallpox, and desired medical advice, which added to the cost. This phase need not be entered into at length, the above outline, being, we believe, sufficient to emphasize our point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the medical interests of Kansas City were busily endeavoring to cope with the sudden big demand for vaccination and preventive treatment, and while the public generally was hovering between fear and terror as to the extent of the scourge, the business interests of Kansas City were struck a blight as serious as it was sudden. Merchants who had been hopefully anticipating a satisfactory holiday business following the general slackening of the summer, suddenly saw’ their expectations go glimmering, but patriotically s-wallowed their losses and cooperated fully with the movement to eliminate what seemed to them a raging smallpox epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The proprietor of a specialty store who was asked to estimate the loss suffered by Kansas City business through the epidemic publicity, threw’ up his hands and said: “It is impossible to estimate the figures. Our business alone fell off in November 40 percent.” .Another business man reported he had letters from the territory asking if it was true people were dying in the streets. Country residents were heard to remark they would be taking their lives in their hands to come to Kansas City to shop. We note in an interview in a local paper in February, 1922, a statement by one of the officials of the Kansas City Symphony Orchestra, as follows: “The symphony concerts would have been a larger success financially and of wider educational value had it not been that Kansas City was suffering from an epidemic at the time the concerts opened. Music lovers in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska who had sent letters of inquiry about sittings at the concerts for the entire winter withdrew their patronage because they did not desire to visit Kansas City at this time. That was an accident that probably never will happen again.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Typhoid</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">In 1898, 32 years ago, the attack rate for typhoid fever in the army was 88 per 1,000 men; that is, 88 men out of 1,000 were attacked by typhoid fever in the United States Army, and the death rate was 9 per 1,000, 9%, in fact, nearly 10. In 1899, one year later only, the attack rate had declined to 22.98 or 23 per 1,000, where it was 88 the year before, and the death rate had declined to about 3 per 1,000, where it was almost 10 the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now this decline continued until 1908, that is, from 1898 until 1908, ten years, when the attack rate was only 3 per 1,000 and only 30/100 of one percent, or one-third of a man per thousand men died from typhoid! This does not include the Spanish War volunteers, and were only those of the regular army. And in the Spanish War volunteers the attack rate of typhoid in 1898 was 166 per 1,000, while in the regular army it was only 88; the death rate in the Spanish Volunteers was 17 per 1,000, against about 10 in the regular army. Then the next year, in 1899, the attack rate was only 17, against 166 the year before and the death rate was a little less than 2 per 1,000, against the death rate in. the regular army of practically 113 per 1,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason for this sudden dropping in both the regular army and. the Spanish Volunteer army is well known to those of us who were alive at that time, because the papers were teeming with the awful, unsanitary conditions existing- in the camps where the soldiers -were housed. They were held there for a long period of time, some of them never getting out of the camp except in boxes, and the conditions of filth beggared description. Relatives who went there to see their sons and fathers were so incensed that they would go home and stir up the newspapers, until it was widely printed all over the United States that the sanitary conditions were such as -would make any Illinois hog raiser ashamed to keep his hogs in such surroundings, and the food they had -was so contaminated and foul that any hog raiser would know his animals would die of cholera if kept that way, and our boys died of typhoid fever. You see, until they had it kicked into them by outraged public opinion they didn’t Know enough to keep a camp clean and in a wholesome living condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now this is the astonishing fact that I want you to note, that this great reduction in the regular army of an attack rate of typhoid fever of 88 per 1,000 down to 3 per 1,000, and the death rate from 10 per 1,000 to one-third of a man per 1,000, occurred three years before there was any inoculation for typhoid fever! It was not until’1911, three years after this great reduction occurred, that inoculation in the army was made compulsory I The disease already had dwindled, thanks to sanitation, and was rapidly disappearing before a single inoculation was performed!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Toxin-Antitoxin</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">When toxin-antitoxin is introduced directly into the blood, it arouses every latent effort of the whole body to throw off the rotten poison which, against all the laws of Nature, has been introduced directly into the blood stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever alleged benefit has been produced in a case of diphtheria by the introduction of a poisonous antitoxin into the blood is produced by arousing intense glandular activity through the entire body, and thousands of glands are brought into violent activity to neutralize and throw off this rotten poison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole point is this: that to produce activity in a gland.it must be gorged with blood, and in gorging all the glands of the body, the entire glandular system, with blood, it pulls some blood away from the throat, and, at the expense of poisoning the whole body, there is a lessening of the intense, active inflammation in the throat, and sometimes there is enough reserve vitality in the body so that it will get well. Many times it does not, and many times almost instant death results from toxin-antitoxin, and this the medical profession knows. Many of our honorable, honest, upright doctors know these facts, and they refuse to risk the life of the child by giving antitoxin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A doctor friend of mine told, me of a surgeon in this town whose assistant did a great deal of his “dirty” -work, and he was called to see a child with a sore throat. The assistant told the family that it was quinsy and that the child would be all right. The great surgeon got wind of it and went to see the child, said it was a case of diphtheria and that ten thousand units of toxin-antitoxin must immediately be given to the child, and that the rest of the children in the family must have three thousand units to immunize them, at $5.00 or $10.00 a throw. Now this is -why I said at the beginning that the people are waking up, in spite of the newspapers’ suppression of the truth. When the father came home at night, he didn’t like the idea and he called my doctor friend, who let the doctor down as lightly as possible, but told the father that the first doctor was right, that the child had quinsy and he need not give the toxinantitoxin and that he could either employ him to finish the case or pay his fee and go on with the other doctor and the antitoxin. The father decided to employ my friend (see, he waked up), and in two days the child was out. But just think of the money the other doctor 'would have made by shooting poison into the whole family, and the added business he would have gotten by taking care of the vdiole family, after making them sick 'with his dirty soup!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All these serums with ■which you risk your life every time you permit the injection of one of them into your blood for a five-dollar or a ten-dollar bill, are deadliest poisons. They are nitrogenous compounds. I don’t think many of you realize that the raw -white of an egg, if injected hypodermically into your blood, will be almost as poisonous as a. rattlesnake bite; it wall probably kill you in a very short time. So poisonous is this perfectly good nitrogenous compound, the white of an egg, that some people with ulcers of the stomach, who have taken rawegg as food, have nearly died from the absorption of some of the pure albumen directly into the blood through the surface of the ulcer. Then -what do yon think of injecting directly into your blood these filthy nitrogenous compounds, made from the blood serum of a sick horse or a goat or any other animal? Why I think it is the craziest, most insane idea that has ever, in the history of the world, been brought out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unnecessary Operations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The late great surgeon J. B. Murphy said that in fifteen hundred cases of appendicitis that he operated upon in Cook County and other hospitals, he found just 157, or a trifle over 10 percent, that had any pathology of the appendix. So by all means rip them out. This shows that 90 percent of operations for appendicitis are unnecessary and that surgery has become a first-class racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just now we have another beautiful racket, and that is the gall bladder racket. It’s either infected, or must be drained, or you’ve got gallstones, and they must be cut out, and the fools don’t know any other way than to cut them out, and they never think of. cutting out the bad habits of living that caused the gallstones in the first place; so of course the gallstones come back unless they cut the wdiole gall bladder out. And that of course they frequently do now, although G od Almighty must have thought lie knew pretty well what He was doing when He put a gall bladder in you to store up the bile which is secreted all the time by the liver, so that when you eat some fat the muscles would contract and pour the bile down into the intestine where it could digest the fat for yon. Those of you who have been unfortunate enough to have your gall bladder causelessly cut out know you can’t digest fat now* as you used to, and the doctor will tell you to eat very lightly of fat, and he knows -why I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following story of a certain gentleman was related to us the other day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About a year or so ago he was seized with, a very sharp, abdominal pain. He thought he had ptomaine poisoning, and because he was in considerable distress he thought he ought to see a doctor, so he consulted the manager of the apartment hotel where he lived, and the manager referred him to .Dr. S. When Dr. S. came the man was thoroughly examined by three doctors, including an X-ray of the whole digestive tract. For some reason or other the doctors seemed to center their attention on the lower part of his bowels, and they prodded and examined and worked in his rectum until he was so sore that he could hardly sit down. When the examination was concluded he was told that lie had cancer of the rectum and that an operation, was necessary. He was told to go up to the Augustana Hospital and be prepared for an operation, which he refused to do. He went back to his hotel. The doctors phoned over to the hotel and gave him no peace until he finally consented to go to the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When he entered the institution he was examined and re-examined and told that the diagnosis was confirmed: that his trouble was a malignant growth in the rectum. Within a day or two after entering the hospital, either from the laxatives he was given or from Nature’s attempt to take care of things in her own way, his bowels began to move very freely. Before his trouble began he had been having three movements a day right along for months and months. He said that in 80 hours when he was in the hospital, his bowels moved 35 times. Included in the various bowel movements there was a lot of hard, fetid material the size of a walnut, and some even bigger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day when the diarrhea had about subsided, an orderly came to his room one morning and said, “I am to prepare you for the operation. ’ ’ The gentleman hooted at the orderly and said he was not the subject for the operation. The orderly replied that the doctor had sent,him up to get him ready. “Well,” said the gentleman, “if you have any other patients to prepare for an operation, go ahead and prepare them, for you won't have any business here in this room, and when the doctor comes in, tell him I want to see him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later in the day the doctor came in and the gentleman told him about liis frequent bowel movements and about his abdominal distress disappearing. He was then re-examined and after the doctors were through he asked them what the verdict was. “Well,” the doctor said, “there is nothing wrong with you, you may go home.” And so the alleged cancer of the rectum, discovered by the most painstaking physical and laboratory diagnosis in one of the best known hospitals of Chicago and by some of the city’s most famous physicians, disappeared through a thorough cleaning of the bowels.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>Polished Rice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Some Asiatics live almost exclusively on the leaves of various plants, plus rice. Well, rice unpolished is one of the finest foods there are, and, combined with leafy vegetables, will keep a person in magnificent health; but it isn’t the rice that you good housewives buy here in Chicago, because the rice you get is polished rice, unless you make a fight and get the unpolished rice. And the reason for that is that the unpolished rice has in it the germ similar to the germ of the wheat, and it has the natural mineral salts that^ support life in the body, and that is why those people who eat such rice have good health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that polished rice will digest quicker than whole rice; whiskey will digest quicker than polished rice, but you cannot live on either polished rice or whiskey. Some of the bran of the ■whole rice wull go through any person, but the mineral salts and vitamines that the person, extracts from the bran of the rice and the bran of the whole wheat is what gives the body proper nourishment, aids in preventing constipation, keeps people in good health, and gives immunity against disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I want to give you a quotation from Alfred W. McCann’s most interesting and scientific book, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This Famishing World.</span><span class="font5"> You can get the book at the Library, if yon don’t buy it. I purchased thirteen copies of it and presented them to different friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of rice, in paragraph 40, page 132, Mr. McCann says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Few Americans have ever eaten rice as Nature intended them to eat it. The beautiful grain, midway between cream color and light brown in hue, with a flavor that the polished rice eater has never tasted, has been banished from the United States for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The robbed substitute is the brushed, scoured, polished and sometimes talcum-coated grain of commerce, so degraded and denatured by the milling processes through which it passes that when fed to the fowls of the barnygrd it brings about their death in seven weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fed on the natural, unrefined grain containing all the elements with which nature has endowed it, the creatures of the barnyard thrive indefinitely. The “innocent” bowl of rice, as we now scour and polish it. served to the growing child and the convalescent struggling desperately upward out of an abyss of distress, will not support human life. We have robbed it as we rob the wheat. No, this is not the cry of an alarmist. Behold the facts. In the Philippine Islands a disease called acidosis, or beri-beri, has wiped away countless thousands. We have similar diseases in the United States, but we call them inanition, anemia, neurasthenia, nervous prostration, general breakdown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beri-beri, or acidosis, journeys from one stage to another, through all of these experiences. Its name neither adds to nor detracts from its ability to destroy. Those who encounter it. die the death. Dr. V. G. Heiser, in the year 1910, then director of health of the Philippine Islands, Dr. Fraser of Singapore, Dr. Aaron of the Philippine Medical School, Dr. Highet of Siam, and Dr. Dchaan of Java, produced evidence that showed conclusively that acidosis or beri-beri is caused by a diet of polished rice, such as,is consumed in the United States. As early as 1905 Dr. Donald MeCaskey had noted the ravages which followed a diet of polished rice. Polislied rice does not introduce some mysterious germ into the body; it simply starves the blood and tissues until they no longer offer a defense to any germ. With resistance broken and immunity destroyed as the result of inadequate nourishment, pathogenic organisms take up their residence in the weakened tissues of the body and grow and multiply until disorder ensues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now why do they polish rice? The reason is that the whole rice contains so much good nutrition that it is impossible to market it in large quantities without its spoiling. It spoils because it is so nutritious that it will become infested with bugs and worms. You see even worms know more than the medical profession about the food value of rice, because they will immediately attack the whole grain, and you don’t find them in polished rice, except when they are starving to death, in very hot weather. Now the reason you don’t find them in polished rice is that the outer coating or bran of the rice, containing the invaluable mineral salts required to keep your body in wholesome, alkalinized condition, is rubbed off and brushed off, as Alfred McCann describes, by the process of polishing; and if you will examine carefully a grain of rice that has been polished you will find a little depression at one end, and it is in that depression that the germ of the rice was formed, and during the polishing process that germ, containing the invaluable phosphorus compounds and oil which all the worms are so hungry for, is thrown off, and finally the pure, -white kernel of rice is ready to be shipped all over the world. And because its food value has been so lessened that it will not sustain anima] life or the life of fowl, or the life of a human creature, the worms know that, and they don’t get into it. Therefore the rice growers in the South can polish their rice, they can ship it all over the world, and it will keep because it has been so robbed of its life-sustaining value that the worms will not get into it. McCann says further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During January and February, 1910, another of the many outbreaks of acidosis among the inmates of the Coulion Leper Colony aroused the interest of the little group of physicians named above. The disease resisted all medical treatment; it was noted that the lepers were striving to maintain life upon a diet of polished rice. As an experiment the polished riee was discontinued and the natural grain substituted. The sick in the hospital were fed with the rice polishings that had been removed from the refined grain. Rice polishings are the outer layers of the rice, that give to the grain its light, creamish brown color. Underneath, the grain is snow-white. This snow-whiteness consists principally of starch; the polishings contain the phosphorus compounds and other mineral salts, ferments, vitamines, and nitrogenous products, brushed, scoured and polished away to make the grain pleasing to the delicate eyes of pale women and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On a sixty days’ diet of the natural grain, to which the riee polishings had been added, the spread of the disease was interrupted and complete cures established. Yet not one of the 400,000 children under ten years of age who died in the United States that year could find a pound of that natural brown rice in all the land. Still the medical profession needed more evidence than this to convince it that when man denatures his food by refining processes he destroys its ability to confer upon him immunity to disease. So Dr. Fraser, of the Straits Settlements, and Dr. Aaron, of the Philippine Medical School, set about to prove that when man brushes, scours and polishes away the phosphorus compounds and other organic minerals present in the pericarp of natural brown rice he robs the human family of its requisite supply of these elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After this fact had been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the physicians in the Far East, it was again experimentally confirmed in chickens, and later in human creatures. Finally two groups of railway workers in the Straits Settlements were employed as a poison squad. The group of men that partook of polished, white, Siam, rice of best quality developed beriberi within a period of approximately sixty days, while the group that partook of the unpolished rice remained free of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average housewife knows nothing at all about food, and when she goes to the grocer and says, “Give me a pound of rice,” she gets 'good old polished rice’; but if you have a scrap with the grocer, and tell him that you -want natural, brown rice or unpolished rice, then you must look out or he will give you rice coated with soapstone and tell you that that is unpolished; they worked that game for a long time, and I had a racket with a grocer’s clerk in one of the department stores, who tried to tell me that rice coated with soapstone was unpolished.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>White Flour</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">What is the real truth in this food matter? Well, take, for instance, the milling of white flour. I’ve told you how<sup>T</sup> white flour is made. It is made and peddled out to you because it keeps, and it keeps only for the reason that in the milling process they have taken out the bran of the grain, containing 5.8 percent of the mineral salts that are vitally necessary for the health of your body; they have taken out the germ containing the oil, and the wonderful pentoxide of phosphorus so necessary to your nervous system; they’ve taken out some portions of the protein and they leave you almost the pure, white starch, which will not sustain life, not even in a worm, and that’s why the worms do not get into it, and that’s why they can mill it up in Minneapolis and ship it all over the world, and it keeps even when it goes into the w<sup>T</sup>arm Southern countries. And here is the reason why they don’t make whole wheat flour: If it IS the whole wheat it will contain the oil from the germ, which tends to make it rancid after a while, and it will be so full of nourishment that, especially in hot weather, such as we usually have through the summer, it is impossible to keep it except but a short while. That is why such people as The Elam Mills, who make honest, whole grain products, and why WE put up these whole grains in small, 1%-pound and 5-pound packages, so that the housewife can use it before it spoils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So you see if they manufactured whole wheat flour in Minneapolis they couldn’t send it out all over the world, as they do now. Some of it goes to the wholesaler, then on to the retailer, on his shelves for an indefinite period, perhaps one, two, three or six months, before the housewife w<sup>T</sup>ould have her order filled for some flour, and in the meantime, when she opened it, she would find, if it were whole wheat flour, there would be worms in it, and she couldn’t use it; she’d take it back to the grocer, he’d fire it back to the wholesaler, and the wholesaler to the mill, and they’d all lose money, and the housewife would be sure the grocer was a dirty man, because he had worms in the whole wheat flour. However, the people are learning that they can’t exist on white flour, and Dr. McCarrison, than whom there is no greater authority, tells us that even when white flour is supplemented with liberal supplies of vegetables and other food it still is much less efficient in maintaining health in the body than the whole wheat flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people are learning in ever increasing numbers, and, it seems, very rapidly, too, that they must have the whole grain, every part of it, to maintain their health; and so they are cutting out the use of white flour, and of course it is putting the white flour millers in a desperate situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They, and the bankers back of them, are facing the entire disruption of the white flour milling industry, and they are moving heaven and earth to prevent that financial calamity to themselves.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Pearled Barley</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">The Bedouins of Arabia, living on barley and dates, have not the barley that you buy at the grocery, 'which is pearled barley and utterly unfit for food. Theirs is the whole grain barley. Pearled barley, like polished rice, wall not support life; pigeons and animals fed on it will die in two or three months or sooner; yet that is what you get in this wonderful system of barbarism that we live under, because they can make a profit on that as they do on white flour, because it keeps, and if the grocer buys a stock of it he can set it on his shelf and it will keep indefinitely. But unpearled barley, such as the Bedouin Arab' eats, will not k'eep for any great length of time. The dates that he’d eat are wonderfully nourishing, a date being equal to a teaspoonful of sugar, only it is a different kind of sugar from our sugar-trust sugar, which is the white and refined product of cane or beets, and is sucrose, while the sugar in the date is levulose or fruit sugar, or dextrose or grape sugar, and easily assimilated. Those Bedouin Arabs will ride all day on their camels’ backs with a double handful of dates for food. Variety in food is not necessarily palatable, because the simple 'food, properly eaten, has a flavor in the taste that is incomparably superior to the insipid tastelessness of white flour products, for instance, or other devitalized foods.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>The Care of the Teeth</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">The latest medical racket to be thrown into the ash can is the teeth and tonsil racket, which the great Chicago physician says we must now abandon as the cause of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now that they have finally awakened they will find that the same thing that causes defective teeth causes pus to come out of tonsils, and that is the same thing that causes rheumatism in that same body, the same thing that will cause asthma, the same thing that will cause Bright’s disease or diabetes. Now that they are discarding the teeth and tonsil racket, what reparation are they going to make to the hundreds of thousands of people who've had their good teeth yanked out, and their tonsils uselessly cut out, sometimes causing death? And just think how, through the inability of people to properly masticate food when their teeth have been pulled, they’ve shortened their lives and done irreparable injury to untold thousands!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Silicon, which exists in the enamel of our teeth, is so small in amount that in 1,048,250 grains, composing the human body, there are only 7 grains of silicon. Yet your teeth will decay, and rot, and you’ll die of inability to chew your food, if you do not have those seven grains of silicon in your body. Now all these elements exist in the natural food which the Creator furnishes us in such abundance, and it is only when these manufacturers of foodless foods take Nature’s products and devitalize them for their own profit that our food is robbed of the various elements necessary to sustain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now I’ll give you a little advice about your teeth, and I’ll tell you about the dentifrice that I have used for many years, and still have a large bottle of it on my washstand, and I shall continue to use it the rest of my life, because it is very effective and very cheap. Just a few years ago the dentifrice slogan was: “Use our dentifrice because a clean tooth never decays.” They are ashamed to use that slogan now, because no matter how clean you keep your teeth on the outside, if you do not keep your body clean inside, and if you do not eat the food that contains the mineral salts to nourish your teeth, food that contains a little silicon and plenty of calcium and phosphorus, your teeth will decay; and they decay from the inside, and not from the outside. They decay because the blood which nourishes the teeth has not sufficient mineral salts to supply the needs for the teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, you should keep your teeth clean, and you can go to the drug store and tell the druggist you want a quarter of a pound of prepared chalk (if I didn’t want to tell you what it is I’d call it “creta praeparata”, and write a prescription for it and charge you $3.00, and the druggist would charge you $1.50 for a quarter of a pound); just go in and say, “Give me a quarter of a pound of prepared chalk,” and he’ll think you know your business, and he’ll charge you ten cents or fifteen cents, or twenty cents probably (less than you would have to pay for any large size tube of any dentifrice), and it -will last you and your family anywhere from one to three or six months. Just take it in your mouth and scrub your teeth -with it and rinse it out; and if you want the bubbling effects noted in Shirley Wynne’s advertisement, just rub your toothbrush on a little Castile soap, or Ivory soap (blot out the Ivory soap, because I’m not paid for it), and wash your teeth with that and the prepared chalk. For many years prepared chalk was the basis for most of the dentifrice made, and there is no use fin your paying a fancy price for scented prepared chalk or any other dentifrice. After brushing your teeth with prepared chalk take a teaspoonful of salt in your mouth and hold it there for five or ten minutes ■while you are dressing. Then rinse out your mouth and see how fine and clean it feels.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Financial Distress</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">LMOST a year lias passed since the Wall Street crash, which may prove to be one of the great financial turning points of history. It may be remembered by the almost desperate efforts for stabilization made by government, bankers and business leaders. Assertions were freely made that business was sound, that only the froth of fictitious values had been shaken, and promises were made to continue the prevailing standards to forestall a possible tide of pessimism and fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Stock Market folded up today in the most disastrous selling movement of the year,” stated the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font5"> of October 9, 1930; “virtually every stock on the list dropped down to a new low, and several of them were under their lows of last year.” Bank failures were up 26 percent in the third quarter of 1930; realty financing was the lowest since 1922, and the first nine months’ total was 64 percent below 1929; automobile output was off 47 percent from last year; some 12,000,000 are estimated as unemployed the world over; three-quarters of the nations of the earth arc sitting upon the volcano of revolution; bread lines are forming for the winter; and Stock Exchange seats which were selling around $625,000 a year ago can be had for a mere $217,000. Ye poor and heavy laden, take notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are but a few of the thousands of depressing results which have been accumulating and hammering their message of fear into the world of men since the crash of last year. And in spite of the promises and the influence of the most talented industrial leaders ever assembled, they have not stemmed the flow of His almighty law one jot or tittle!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His almighty&quot; law, of sowing and reaping, of cause for effect, of sabbaths and surpluses, of suffering and misery&quot; from unsound and broken laws, is as inevitable as the law of passing time. Though many leaders acted in good faith in promising stabilizing efforts, they could not keep the faith. Business had been hurt far more than outward appearances indicated. They laid men off by the thousands, in frightened retrenchment; they<sup>7</sup> slashed wages, cut down the working week, curtailed their purchases, until conditions became alarming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With winter coming, bread lines growing longer, agitation and distress coming from, most parts of the country, President Hoover found it necessary to draw up an unemployment coin</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By F. W. O’Neill</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(New York)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mittee to help cope with the 'distressing need of the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Business has been urged to spur up its program again, and to make every effort to employ men. A stagger system has been planned whereby two men divide the week’s work. Cities are cooperating and raising funds for the unemployed and needy. Every effort, from a $450,000,000 governmental road-building program down to an appeal for minor house repairs, has been urged that work may&quot; be found to relieve a fast-growing demoralization. Probably never in the history of the country&quot; have such strenuous efforts been made to overcome the fear of depression and undue retrenchment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those efforts are not to be belittled: they will do some good, for a time. But the rose-colored vision of the industrial leaders may&quot; be just as fruitful, of reduced profits and hard times, as last year’s assertions have been. In fact, they may&quot; be decidedly more damaging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the present situation we see again the almost desperate attempt by&quot; government and business leaders to stabilize conditions. Assertions are just as profuse, if not more so. Headlines in the New&quot; York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of October 23 stated: “Trade Revival of Business on a Scale Hitherto Unknown Predicted by Business Leaders Meeting in Chicago.” The press is bubbling over with “Buy Now” slogans; business is crying for confidence upon the part of the people. “Don’t sell the U. S. short,” they say, “the spirit and industry of the American people and its leaders will meet the emergency wutli renewed strength, confidence and success.” But that is practically&quot; what they said at the time of the crash. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Actions speak louder than words. And a little article tucked atvay in the pages of the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of October 24, will give a far greater insight of the thoughts flowing through, the minds of the mighty than a thousand pages of honey’ed advertising:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">London, Oct. 23. The London insurance market is always highly sensitive to the risks of civil commotion, and forebodings of trouble are often felt here long before outbreaks occur in faraway places. . . . Owners of property in the United States, it was disclosed tonight, are placing insurance in London (Lloyds) against risks of civil disturbance, and a heavy business is also being done with Spain in anticipation of trouble there, as well as Brazil. . . . This is the first time, however, that the demand for insurance on property against risk of damage has spread to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brazil, it might be noted, overthrew its government the very next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can business face the present skirmish in the field of depression? Leaving out the risks of revolution, warfare, and other social and political hazards, what is the business outlook?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inasmuch as business itself does not know the real cause for the depression, it is unlikely that business can cure it. Business, therefore, is not showing a united front; many are willing to let the other fellow start something, while Ihey nurse their own bankrolls. Retrenchment is the order of the day; both big and little fellows have curtailed their spending, and it is going to take more than shouting “Happy days are here again” to start real productive activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Profits have been cut through low commodity prices, competition, and small turnovers; and high overhead, such as executives’ salaries, rents, depreciation, etc., are cutting into surplus profits. Half-week jobs are putting no more money into circulation than formerly, and a heavy tax is going to be saddled upon the shoulders of the people for unemployment relief for road building, dams, maintenance, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Government revenues are going to take a terrific slash, due to the depression and the tariff enactment, and taxes to make up the deficit are not going to bring rhapsodies of joy from the business man; indeed, another skirmish deeper into the throes of depression tvhen the government forecasts its tax requirements next year is not improbable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indications point to a repeal of the prohibition law to try and save the days to come, what with its beer and pocket-filling revenues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If, by midwinter, a nation is turning the wheels of industry steadily, and sales and turnovers are improving and profitable, then the leaders of such accomplishments have overcome truly depressing obstacles, considering the unsoundness and uncertainties of the present situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But business is affected by social and political conditions, and there is always the threat of warfare, revolution, and uncertainty to upset the progress and happiness of the people, in spite of leagues, covenants and good-will lipservice of their leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If heavy taxes, unemployment and tight money east their fears into the wheels of industry, combined with the threats of political upsets, then demoralization indeed will begin to ride in the seats of the mighty. The frenzy of securing cash, to liquidate their frozen assets of stocks, and another stock market crash would not be improbable; and the world would proceed another step nearer to the depths of the depression, and Waterloo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today we are only riding near the top of the downward swing of depression. Economists who have studied after-war “cycles” realize that the inflation leading up to the crash was excessive, unduly prolonged. Now the after effects, the long-drawn-out march of reaction to the depths, has only set in. Finance knows it, Wall Street vainly tries to ignore it, only to sink further in the muck. And the end is not yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is another important aspect not to bo overlooked in the face of impending conditions. While productive processes have increased, the rural population has been turning to the cities. And urban populations are dependents. At present commodity prices are low, due, it is claimed, to surpluses and lower prices since the crash. Requests have been made by the government to curtail production of wheat, so as to help boost prices. With lower prices, the manufacturer also is curtailing production, so as to reduce stocks; for low prices mean small profits, or none. Reduced prices also help the public consume or store these goods. Indications point to still lower prices, and the consuming of goods, without due consideration for replacements!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And considering the vast multitude to be clothed and fed, unless there is firm and intelligent handling of the problem by the controlling elements of finance, industry and government, before the people are aware, there will be shortage, famine, of commodities and goods. Just as we are experiencing the* reverse of inflated money, so shall we experience the reaction of abounding surpluses, only with the added tragedy of dire want and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A bad day is upon the world. Ruinous droughts have scorched large areas in the Western Hemisphere as well as in other countries ; water scarcity is still a mighty problem in parts of the country. Water is selling for five cents a glass in sections of Virginia, according to a recent traveler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indeed, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> has already noted that Herbert Janvrin Browne, expert in the study of ocean currents, has expressed his conviction, based upon scientific studies, of solar influences affecting abnormal areas of intensi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fication in all the oceans of the world, as leading to reduced harvests; and that governmental measures might be necessary to save people from starvation. Though slowly, perhaps belatedly, this certainly has been verified by the trend of events throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the end is not yet. “The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.”—Ezek. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the whole core of economic life, upon which modern man depends for existence, is government. And while worthy efforts to relieve the depression and unemployment may alleviate conditions temporarily, they will not remedy the evils -within the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Harry Elmer Barnes, Ph. D. writes: “All this is splendid as an emergency step. But we see no greater evidence than previously of any real attempt to get down to brass tacks on the problem of business depression and the unemployment of labor. . . . After all, the current depression is not the real problem, even though its effects must be met immediately and decisively. The depression is only a symptom of a deeper disorder. It is only the stalling of a rickety and antique machine, which has let down the American people many times in the past. This disintegrating machine is none other than capitalistic individualism, old style, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us briefly review this money system and present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Money is not &quot;wealth; money is a paper or metal, man-made representative of wealth. Money never of itself erected a building or grew the wealth of a field of wheat. Money actually is a credit instrument, making available the transfer of these necessary goods through trade, contract or barter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'■ We do not'know how His glorious kingdom will control what is now the banking and monetary systems. But even our present money system could be beneficial to the people, if properly governed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But! Money is to a nation as blood is to the human system. It must flow and circulate to every member, because every member requires it to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What then can be the condemnation of the most selfish of systems, which allows its vast accumulations of wealth to clot up in vast hoards in bank vaults and strong boxes, while a whole nation is practically becoming paralyzed because the blood, or money circulation, is not coursing through its business arteries as the natural law demands. Clot the blood in the human system around the heart or brain, and it means death1 So with the money system. Can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit? Can a good tree bring forth want, poverty, unemployment, misery or gluttonous wealth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But money will still be wealth, until He whose right it is to overthrow shall cast its unsound values into the dust of everlasting contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But taking money as it is today, it has a far greater purchasing power than it has had for the past ten years, thanks to the unsoundness and the flaws in its system. It may have even greater purchasing power as prices go lower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Y</span><span class="font5">OU might be interested in the experience of a volunteer who was canvassing in Dallas a few Sundays ago. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font5"> program for the day was an oral repetition of the lecture by Judge Rutherford on “Presumptuous Sins”. The volunteer asked if they had heard the lectures over the radio. They had, and were angry. They called the apartment house manager to ‘stop the book agent from canvassing in the apartment house’. He came, found that it was the same as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font5"> radio programs, and took the seven books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the volunteer changed her method of approach, announcing that she was doing a bit of “Christian work”. Last Sunday she introduced herself this way, and at one house she had the door slammed in her face'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another volunteer then called at the house and announced that she was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">from The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> and asked if they had heard the radio programs. They invited her in and took the set of seven books. They explained that they thought the first caller was collecting their dues for the church, and they had learned from the radio lectures that the church could not guarantee safe transportation to heaven, even if they did pay promptly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A few vzeeks ago, after announcing that the Watch Tower not only used the radio, but also sponsored Bible classes, and furnished Bible aids, books to help in studying, the listeners were invited to phone or write in and a volunteer would bring the books for their inspection. There were 43 bound books and 31 booklets placed as a result of this one announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the colored people in Texas have commercialized their religion. In Plano, a town of about fifteen hundred people, some three hundred of them colored, the Colored Baptists are said to have turned twenty or more out of the church for not paying the preacher. One woman told them that ‘they could turn her out of the church, but could not send her to hell’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By R. E. Hendrix (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In San Antonio, a lady told the writer that when her husband died the preacher sent a bill for $25 the day after the funeral, as his charge for his services. She sent him ten dollars and told him to- take it or leave it, that she considered that more than it was worth. He took it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A radio revivalist at Dallas was holding forth recently. He had been orating about an orangecolored book called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font5"> and said that the people who sold it had lots of questions that caught the people’s eye, but these were not the questions that were important. The important question was whether you wore saved from hell or not. So I was listening in on him. He had announced that if it was permissible, he was going to expose the-purveyors of this book. But it must not have been permissible. He announced that he had been severely criticized; and so far as I have learned, not a single Bible Student was among the critics. Evidently the people have read this orange-colored book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While I was listening to him, expecting to hear further denouncement of the Bible Students, I heard him sing two songs, offer a prayer, and make seven separate appeals for money, in less than 28 minutes. Then he topped it all off with a prayer in which he prayed God to send him a motorcycle, a trunk, and a thousand dollars. I haven’t heard about the thousand dollars or the motorcycle; but he did not pray loud enough, for God must have misunderstood the request for the trunk. Someone sent him a truck, so he said, and he explained again that it was a trunk that he wanted to go on the back of a car the dear public had bought for him. Last week he was still talking about that trunk, several months after his prayer for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH GOD gave to Christ Jesus the Revelation of and concerning what should come to pass in the last days, and He commanded that The Revelation should be made understandable in due time. Revelation is the last book in the Bible. It is a great prophecy, and it is written in sign or symbolic language to conceal its meaning until God’s due time to uncover it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While John, a faithful follower of Jesus Christ, was exiled the Lord sent His angel to him and caused John to write doivn the Revelation, and this we have in the Bible. For many centuries men have tried to interpret the book of Revelation but have failed. God never purposed that any man should interpret that book, yet it is clearly made to appear that He will permit men to understand it in due time. John represented the last faithful members of Christ on earth, and it is clearly God’s purpose that these should first understand Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book is a prophecy, and God’s rule is to bring to pass the events that constitute a fulfilment of the prophecy and then permit men to set these facts along beside the prophecy and see the meaning thereof. Thanks be to His name, that time has now come. The book of Revelation is open to the reading of men. The key to the opening thereof is found in the latter part of chapter eleven and in chapter twelve. In the eleventh chapter the statement is made: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, . . . because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” In that manner the time is fixed when God puts Jesus Christ upon His throne to rule, and the Revelation begins to be fulfilled. The year 1914 marks tlie beginning of that time, with the coming of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three and a half years thereafter, to wit, in 1918, marks the coming of the Lord to His temple, and concerning Revelation it is written: ‘‘And the temple of God was opened in heaven.” As a general rule God fulfils prophecy and then permits His people to understand it. It was in .1925 that those devoted to the Lord God began to understand Revelation. The Scriptures show that those of the temple were the first to understand it. “The temple of God” means those who are devoted to Jehovah and His Christ. Those who do understand must then be faithful and tell it to others, that the people may gain a knowledge thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two books called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> have recently come off the press. In these books every part of the Revelation is explained in such simple manner that all may understand who earnestly seek to know. Men and women who are devoted to God, and who obey His commandments to preach the gospel of the kingdom, bring these books to your homes that you may have an opportunity to understand this great prophecy of and concerning God’s kingdom. To them it is a wonderful privilege to bring these books to you. It will be a great blessing to you to read and to understand them. This statement is made with confidence because it is written in Revelation 1:3: “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately following the statement concerning the opening of the temple in heaven these ivords are recorded, in chapter 12, verses one to three: “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two ivonders or signs here mentioned are two great opposing organizations, to wit, God’s organization and Satan’s organization. The time of the fulfilment of the prophecy is when these two great organizations have reached a climax and God begins to take account with the enemy organization to the end that His word and His name may be vindicated and the people learn the truth and be delivered from bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures picture Jehovah God as the great Husband, while Uis organization universal is designated by His pure woman called Zion. You will now call to mind that to Abraham and his wife Sarah God promised that He would bring forth a “seed”, through which all the nations of earth should be blessed. In that prophetic picture Abraham represented Jehovah God the husband, while Sarah his wife pictured</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s universal organization, called Zion, the pure woman. For </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a long</span><span class="font5"> while the wife of Abraham was without child. When she and Abraham were both old their only son Isaac was bom. Isaac was a type of Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, who became the King of the world and is the promised seed. Those persons on earth w<sup>T</sup>ho are really devoted to God and who are striving to obey His commandments are given to understand of heavenly things. They do not get this understanding by some scene that appears to their natural eye, but they have a mental vision which is the result of careful study of the Word of God in the light of well known facts. Having the spirit of God they are enabled to harmonize these facts with the Scriptures and thereby ascertain the correct meaning. When the Scriptures speak of a “great sign in heaven” it means that those who have an understanding of heavenly things shall have a mental understanding of the Scriptures showing a fulfilment of this great prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus had finished His earthly work and was about to take His departure to heaven He told His disciples He was going away to prepare a place for them and that He would come again; and that at His second coming He would oust Satan and set up God’s kingdom of righteousness through which blessings would flow out to the people. Then the day of deliverance would be at hand. From then until the present time the outstanding thing for which true Christians have looked, prayed and hoped is the second coming of Christ and the setting up of His kingdom. Jesus stated that God had given to Him the kingdom, and therefore it was from that time w’hen He wrns anointed that He ■was earth’s rightful King. The beginning of the exercise of His power as King, how’ever, must be deferred until God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The coming of that kingdom and its beginning is pictured in Revelation by a woman giving birth to a man child, which man child represents the kingdom which shall rule all the nations of the earth. The birth of a creature is the result of the operation of the God-given powers of husband and wife. The woman in this picture represented God’s organization, called Zion; Jehovah God is her husband, and He accepts her, His organization, as His wife, because He has made her fruitful and acknowledges her offspring as His. This was prophetically shown in His dealing with the nation of Israel, which foreshadowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s kingdom under Christ. In the fifty-fourth chapter of' Isaiah it is written concerning the divine organization: “For thy Maker is thine husband; The Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s organization, symbolized by the pure woman, is partially visible to man, but the greater part thereof is invisible to man. It includes His beloved Son and all the host of heavenly creatures in harmony with God, and it includes those on earth who are faithful and true to God. The latter is the only part that is visible to human eyes, but these are the ones who are in real danger, by reason of the enmity of Satan against God and against His organization and the children thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Note that the woman is clothed and shod with God’s light. The sun was her clothing, and the moon her shoes, and the stars are about her head. The sun and the moon and the stars give light to men on the earth. So the light of God shines upon and about them that love and serve Him. Those of God’s organization on earth are sure of God’s light and favor both day and night, which is here symbolized. The Twelve stars upon the head of the woman’ symbolically says: 'She is a heavenly queen and therefore fit to bring forth the offspring of Jehovah. Her husband is the King of Eternity.’ (Jer. 10:10) Being with child and about to be delivered she cried out. (See verse 2.) Her cries were those of pain directed to Jehovah God, the only One who could help her. Her cries are prayers for God’s kingdom to begin. Clearly the lesson taught by this is that the kingdom is not produced except at great cost of pain and suffering on the part of those who are members of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■—Acts 14: 22; Gal. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that Jehovah gave His word of promise that He would bring forth a seed that would rule the nations of the world is proof that at some time this seed must be born. Jehovah’s organization gives birth to the seed, which is the kingdom, and Jehovah himself is the Father or Giver of life thereto. The birth means the time when the kingdom begins to function. On last Sunday it was my privilege to call your attention to the Scriptural proof showing the organization of Jehovah and that of Satan in opposition. The two great 'sig-ns’, or 'wonders’, represent these respective organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan is designated in the Scriptures as a wily, sly and deceptive creature. One of his fraudulent deceptions, long practiced, has been to keep the people in ignorance of the fact that there is such a creature in existence as Satan. Millions on the earth do not believe there is a Devil or Satan. Many who do believe that such a wicked one exists are totally ignorant of his power over men. Only a very few, comparatively, know that Satan has a powerful organization and that he controls the nations of the world. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is carrying on an educational work a part of which is to inform the people concerning the wicked one and his powerful organization and to show them how relief must come through God’s organization. In 1 John 5:19 it is plainly stated that the &quot;whole world is under the control of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was on earth Satan the Devil repeatedly tried to kill Him. In this he employed the clergy of that day, who constantly persecuted Jesus and conspired to take His life. For that reason Jesus told those clergymen that they were of their father the Devil even though they claimed to represent God. It should be expected that the Devil would be watching for an opportunity to destroy the kingdom of God as soon as it began to function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In harmony with this conclusion Revelation 12:3 tells of another great “wonder” or “sign” that appeared. Recently to those who have their minds in tune with Jehovah that great wonder or sign has been seen to be Satan’s organization. It is described as “a great red......dragon”. One of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the names that God gave Satan is that of “dragon”, which means a vicious one that seeks the destruction of all he cannot control. “Red dragon” symbolizes a bloody and destructive organization with Satan in command. The Devil and his organization are therefore described as a “great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads”. The number seven is symbolic of completeness of the organization that is invisible to man, while number ten is symbolic of the completeness of the visible part of this wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan must of necessity be familiar with the text of the Scriptures. It is so stated in the Bible. Knowing that God had promised a seed or kingdom, and that this seed is his deadly foe, Satan necessarily would &quot;watch for its development and its birth. In harmony with this conclusion it is written, in the fourth verse: “And the dragon [Satan] stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.” Satan is here pictured as standing before the woman, which is God’s organization, watching for the opportunity to destroy the kingdom as soon as it began to function. This pictures exactly the condition of affairs in the universe at about the close of the year 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus ascended into heaven, following His resurrection, He was then God’s anointed King and to Him all power in heaven and earth had been committed, as He declared. He could, then have proceeded to completely oust Satan and begin His own rule of righteousness, but God’s due time had not yet arrived. Doubtless He wanted to proceed if that had been Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Psalm 110 it is &quot;written that Jehovah God said to Jesus: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” Otherwise stated, God told Jesus to await His due time to overthrow the enemy and then He should go forth to that work. The birth, or the beginning, of the kingdom must wait until that due time. In the meantime God has caused His gospel to be preached amongst men that those who desired might have an opportunity to hear and obey and enter into the covenant with Him for a place in that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After waiting for a period of nearly 1900 years the kingdom is born, and in symbolic language it is described, in verse five, as follows: “And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.” (Rev. 12:5) That marks the time when the kingdom began to function in heaven. The statement here that ‘the man child was caught up to heaven’ shows that it is God’s kingdom and power or rule functioning from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">War</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the prophecy of the 110th Psalm God foretold that the time would come &quot;when He would send forth Jesus Christ, His great executive, to rule in the midst of His enemies and that at that time the nations of “Christendom” would be angry and the time of God’s wrath would begin to be expressed. The prophecies of Job and Zechariah, and other prophecies, furnish the proof that up to that time Satan had had his official position in heaven. The time having come for Jesus Christ to begin His reign in heaven, it follows that there could he no relationship between God’s government and Satan’s, but that Satan must get out. It is written, in 2 Corinthians 6:15, that the kingdom of Christ can have nothing in common with Satan. At the time God cast man out of Eden He declared that He would put enmity between the seed of the woman and that of Satan. The seed of the woman is Christ, the kingdom of God. Satan the wicked one refusing to vacate his position in heaven, it follows that he must be ousted, and therefore war would follow. Jehovah God had foretold this war by His prophet in these words: “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.”—Ps. 110: 2, 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the time came for the fulfilment of these prophetic words it meant war. That time arrived when Jehovah placed Christ upon His throne in 1914. In harmony with this statement Revelation 12: 7 says: “And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels.” Michael is another name Jehovah gives to His beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This scripture shows that the host of holy angels of heaven assembled under Christ Jesus for battle, that the wicked angels assembled under Satan, and that there was war in heaven; and that Satan and his forces were defeated and Satan was east out of heaven to the earth. The revelator’s account thereof appears in verses eight and nine, to wit: “And [the dragon and his angels] prevailed not; neither-was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which de-ceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the World War beginning in 1914 the nations of earth, were in a bad condition; there was much crime and wickedness in the land. But since the war ended, crime and all manner of wickedness has increased at a tremendous rate. So alarming is the increase of crime that the executive of the United States has appointed a commission to ascertain the reason and the remedy; and the clergy offer their aid, but entirely ignore God’s Word. The president of the United States in a public address announced that more crime is committed in the United States than in any other nation of earth. And the United States is the leading nation of “Christendom”, or so-called “organized Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In America “organized Christianity” has brought forth a prohibition law by which it is claimed that wickedness would be cleared out, while the facts show that in the time of Prohibition there has been committed the greatest amount of crime. At the same time the gigantic corporations oppress the common people of the land far more than at any time past; and the people must groan and bear it, being unable to relieve themselves. The politicians are more corrupt and wicked than before the war. Even the judges of the courts buy their offices and sell their power for filthy lucre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cooperating with these money powers and politicians is the religious element led by the clergy as the chief exponents of Prohibition and of the League of Nations. The same religious element has turned away from God and IIis Word, repudiating the blood of Jesus Christ, and denied the kingdom of God as the means for cleaning up the earth, restoring mankind to life, and giving them peace and happiness. What is the real reason of this terrible condition? This chapter of Revelation gives the answer in thunder tones; and it is that Satan the Devil has been cast out of heaven and has come down to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this means a time of great woe to the peoples of earth is clearly proven by verse twelve of this chapter, which reads: “Woe to the inliafilters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” The people must now be informed of this fact, and God will see to it that they have the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next great act toward the ousting of Satan from the earth is the battle of Armageddon, at which time Satan and his organization will be completely destroyed by the victor, Christ, who is the world’s rightful King. The statement in this text, that ‘Satan knows that his time is short’, means that he know’s that his time to prepare for the great battle is short; and his plan is to turn all the peoples against God before that time, thinking that thereby he will be able to carry out his boast to cause all men to curse God and die. Satan’s great wrath is directed against God and His organization. He therefore brings great woe, distress, and suffering upon the peoples, causing them much trouble and sorrow, and then uses his pious-faced, lyinglipped clergy to pose as Jehovah’s ministers and to tell the people that Jehovah God is responsible for their calamities and their woes. In this it is Satan’s purpose to turn the people against God and to cause them to curse Him before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The battle of Armageddon, which is near, is the great and final battle that will be fought between the forces of Satan on one side, and the forces of Christ Jesus upon the other side. In that battle the Devil will be cleared out and his organization swept from the earth and out of existence. Jesus, in Matthew 24: 21, describes that battle as a time of trouble such as the world has never known and that it will be the last, because there never again shall come such affliction upon humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have asked the question, If Christ has begun His reign, why is there such a great amount of wickedness in the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is just as here given, that Satan is now striving to turn all humankind against God before Armageddon is fought, and in doing so he is bringing upon them calamities, attempting to push all the world into the shambles and to charge God therewith. To be sure, Jehovah by Christ could kill the Devil and destroy his organization immediately, but before doing so it is the will of God that the people shall be informed of the purpose of the impending battle of Armageddon that they may appreciate its meaning when it comes. If the people were not so informed they would not have the opportunity to take their stand on the side'of Jehovah and to patiently wait for the full exercise of His power. Furthermore, while the people are suffering from the oppressive woes that Satan has brought upon them, a knowledge of the truth will enable them to bear up under these trials, feeing that deliverance.by the kingdom of God is just ahead. Therefore Jesus commands His followers in this language: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.”-—Matt. 24:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This gospel or good news is that Satan’s w’orld has ended, that Christ lias come, and the kingdom of righteousness is here, and the deliverance will follow the complete overthrow of Satan and his organization. Jesus then says that as soon as this witness work is completed the great and decisive battle of God </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Almi</span><span class="font5">ghty will follow. Who will be the ones to bear this information to the people, that Jehovah is God and that His kingdom is the relief for all humankind? Not the clergy and their organization, because they serve the opposing master. Not even all those who have consecrated themselves to do God’s will and to obey His commandments will carry this information to the people. The Lord’s Word shows that a comparatively small number of men and women whom He calls the “remnant” will joyfully do the work of bearing testimony of the truth to the people. This work is now’ being done, and that is the reason why men and women are calling at youi' doors with the books in which you can find reference to the Scriptures and where these great truths appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now<sup>7</sup> note that Revelation 12:17 says: “And the dragon [the Devil and his organization] was wroth w’ith the woman [God’s organization, including the faithful witnesses on earth], and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” It is this remnant that joyfully engage in bringing to you the message of truth and thus preaching the gospel of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that for a long while the clergy have claimed to represent God and to preach Christ and Him crucified, but they have been unfaithful to their claim. I have nothing to say against them personally, but their course of action and their doctrines prove them to be hypocrites. You must know that they now participate in the politics of the world and advocate and support the various worldly schemes, all of which fail to bring relief. That shows that they arc not God’s representatives. It is this same class of men that oppose the work of giving the people the information now concerning Satan’s organization and God’s organization. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God committed to Jesus Christ the great work of giving testimony and informing the people concerning His kingdom. In turn, Jesus' Christ commits this work in part to His faithful fol-low'ers, who are here called the “remnant”; and now in obedience to the commandments of God this little band of men and women come to you with the message of truth. You are not asked to join anything. You are not asked to contribute one cent of money. The little sum taken for the books is used as far as it will go to print more books for other people. You are asked only to inform yourselves of the truth that you may be fully warned of the great impending battle of Armageddon that soon shall follow. You must choose for yourself as to what course you will take. Let no personal friendship or personal prejudice influence you in your decision. Take your Bible and find out the truth. These books will enable you to find the truth in the Bible.</span></p>

You have wanted to know<sup>7</sup> w’hat is the meaning of the twohorned beast; and what is meant by those who are tormented with fire and brimstone; and why the rest of the dead lived not until the end of the thousand years. You have diligently sought to know what is meant by the glorious city, and who may enter thereinto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the curtains of heaven have been pulled back and God has revealed the meaning of these perplexing questions because it is His due time that they shall be understood. I strongly recommend that you avail yourselves of the opportunity to understand. These perplexing questions’ of Revelation are now made clear in the bvo books called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font5"> They give the facts which you know to be true, and set them along by the side of the scriptures; and by reading these scriptures together with the facts, you can see and understand the prophecy; and seeing, you will rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore let not poverty or opposition by the clergy and their master prevent you from learning these vital truths. Let the clergy of the land, the magistrates and the judges, and other offi-ieers of the law take note that God has commanded that this message of truth shall be taken to the people, and woe be unto those who interfere with the ■work of Jehovah. If you do not want the truth, let it alone; but do not oppose it. If you want a knowledge of the Godgiven reasons for the distress of humankind, and God’s complete remedy for these ills, accept the message and learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who will bring you these books are doing so because God has commanded that this gospel shall be preached as a testimony to the nations before the final end. They delight to bring you this message because it vindicates God’s word and name and will bring you hope and great relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To these faithful -witnesses, I bid you Godspeed and God’s'*richest blessings. You are privileged to engage in the greatest work that has ever been done since the days that Jesus was on earth. Be of good courage, and with joy press the battle to the gate. Jehovah of heaven will grant full protection to His people and give them peace and now will vindicate His holy name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">U</span><span class="font5">NDER'the title, “Relief for those who need it, and no questions asked,” George F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Johnson, of the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company, Johnson City, N. Y., published the following advertisement in the Binghamton </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font5"> of November 13:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The E. J. Workers’ Organization propose to open all their restaurants and furnish hot food for those otherwise denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There will also be need for warm sleeping quarters, by many who are seeking work in vain. A good use for the “Police, Department,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is to see that these weary souls^re given food, warmth and shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be a good use for nice, warm, cosy churches, if they were opened, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">warmed and lighted. </span><span class="font4">Yes, I believe it would not be a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bad idea</span><span class="font4"> to have those “wonderful organs,” between seven and nine in the evening, playing sweet, old-fashioned melodies, that never yet failed to warm the heart, ease the mind, and bring rest and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some people have been known to use the church as a “sleeping house.” If times grow worse (and they probably will), why not use the church as suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We sing with great enthusiasm, “Rescue the perishing,” “Care for the dying”; and a great many other beautiful things, we are singing about in our worship. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How would it seem to do it,</span><span class="font4"> during this long, “hard winter” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">just ahead of us?</span><span class="font4"> It would be a new experience, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and perhaps a good one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not a living Thing for Ten Miles </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By A. V. Brink, (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> WISH to add another item on the evil effects and poison of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">W. A. Tull, of Chilton, Tex., was induced to read the last July number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font5">which gave an account of the different items and dates published exposing aluminum poisoning, and also contained Dr. Betts’ affidavit, which tvas all new to him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then he told me in the presence of seven others that he has lived in Texas forty years, but was born and raised in Saline county, Ark., on Hurricane Creek, a running stream abounding in fish of all kinds. He had spent many happy hours fishing in that stream and was nearly always rewarded with a good catch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five years ago he visited the old home community and naturally wanted to go fishing in the old stream of his boyhood days. Did he? Oh, no; the aluminum trust has opened up near the creek a bauxite mine, the ore from which aluminum is made. They use lots of water to wash this ore. They cut a ditch from the mine to the creek and drained the washings from the bauxite into the creek. Result: Not a living thing for ten miles or more in that creek; not a fish, snake, tadpole, mellow bug or wiggle-tail anywdiere to be seen below the mine in the creek. Is aluminum poison? What?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then his sister told of her daughter-in-law’s cooking some plums in a nice, bright aluminum vessel. Horrors! The whole mass turned black. What is it that caused it? It never did that before. They were entirely ignorant of the cause, but when their eyes were opened they just wanted that number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> to take home and read to daughter and son. It was freely given, although my daughter, who takes it, had not read that number. I hope not only that it will be the means of protecting their health against poison, but that it may be the cause of their receiving the truth concerning Jehovah God’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TAURING this week a special effort will be made to distribute Judge Rutherford’s splendid writings among the people. Throughout the entire world special combinations of three books for one dollar will be offered to all people who are interested in the Bible message. This price, you will agree, is amazingly low for three of these beautifully bound books. It is hard to believe, but it is really true. During this week Christian people everywhere will call on people in all walks of life ail'd briefly explain to them the meaning of the Kingdom of God, why its establishment is due and what blessings it will bring to mankind. We know that many </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> readers will take a part in this tremendous campaign to spread the Kingdom message far and wide. Here is the way YOU can have a share in this good work. Tell your neighbors, friends and acquaintances about the books containing the Kingdom message. Show them your own books and tell them the surprisingly low price. Then offer to send in their orders for any number they may want, whether 3, 6 or 9. Or they may write us direct about these books and we will immediately mail them postpaid.</span></p>

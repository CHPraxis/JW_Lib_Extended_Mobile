<p><span class="font10">The Blood of Man and Beast</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N THE effort of the so-called “scientists” of our day to eliminate Jehovah God from their calculations, and to do all possible to bring dishonor to His name, there has been a desperate effort made to substantiate the theory not only that there is no substantial difference between man and beast, but that they have the perfect right to mix one with the other in any way they choose. This, however, is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The article by Charles A. Pattillo, of Virginia, on “The Sacredness of Human Blood”, which appears in this issue, presents an entirely new viewpoint. If the pollution of human blood is un-scriptural, as Mr. Pattillo’s article seems plainly to show is the case, it can be depended upon that the men who have heretofore had little real opposition on the subject of vaccination and se-rumization will suddenly find themselves confronted with an army of conscientious objectors who will rely for their guidance upon the laws of the Book of books and for their protection upon its Author, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The common sense of mankind, as well as the Scriptures, forbids attempts to produce hybrids of humans and other creatures, whether those creatures are of the heavenly realm, as in the case of the angels that sinned prior to the flood, by leaving their proper estate and taking to themselves wives from among the daughters of men, or are “of the earth, earthy”, and far beneath man from every point of view. The common people have much common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having the same spirit of disobedience that animated the angels of old that sinned, but not having their temptation, and not having their powers, a group of so-called “scientists”, however, left London about a year ago and proceeded to equatorial Africa with the avowed intention of undertaking to bring about a cross between orang-utans and men and women. This was in direct violation of a command of Jehovah God given to the Israelites. There must be no flowing of human blood in the veins of animals, nor flowing of the blood of beasts in the veins of those created in the image and likeness of God. “Neither shalt thou lie with any beast, to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.” —Lev. 18:23.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>What Vaccination Does</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Hitherto we have regarded the above prohibition as made wholly because of the unnatural bestiality involved, but it now appears that there is a deeper reason. The blood of man is sacred. It may not be polluted by coming in contact with the blood of any other creature, either as above, or by the insidious method of serums, or as a food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is no doubt literally true that after Cain had slain Abel the voice of his brother’s blood truly ‘cried unto God from the earth’. (Gen. 4:10) That is the statement of the Scriptures, and there is no reason to contest it. The vibrations could not be concealed. The life had been poured out, but the evidences of the crime, mute to human ears, but not to those of Divinity, continued to throb in the ears of the Creator. Manifestly, the earth itself had no right to these peculiar vibrations which belonged by creative gift to the organism of Abel only. Hence the warning and declaration to Cain: “When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength.”—Gen. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men of science (?), entrusted with the guardianship of the public health, have in recent years assumed the absolute right to mingle the blood of diseased calves and diseased horses with that of little children and others. The charge has been made by others that in thus confusing the human blood stream, and mingling human blood cells with other blood cells, they may be properly accused of originating multitudes of diseases and intensifying some of the plagues (such as</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">cancer) from which unhappy man is now suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the Israelites were told that they might eat flesh, yet they were also told, “Ye shall not eat the blood: ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.” (Dent. 12:16) If God forbade His people to do anything with the blood of slain, animals except to pour it out upon the earth, what right has anybody now to say to the rest of his fellow men that the blood of a calf or horse, after having been poisoned and rendered filthy to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nth</span><span class="font5"> degree, must, instead of being poured out upon the ground, be poured right into the most sacred thing in this world today, the blood of living children ? In the light of this prohibition there is even a question whether it is right to use ox-blood in the manufacture of buttons; it is certainly wrong to use it in the manufacture of white sugar.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Blood May Not Be Eaten</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Until one has looked into the matter, it is surprising to find how many and how urgent are the instructions given to the Israelites that they may not eat blood, under penalty of being cut off. Here, for instance, is this command, found in Leviticus 7: 26, 27: “Ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it he of fowl, or of beast, in any of your dwellings. Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from bis people.” There must, have been some good reason, some ample justification, for such a command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When animal food was to be used, the animal was to be killed in such a way as to allow all the blood to leave the carcass. To this day the Jews are very particular, when preparing animal food, to cut the throat of the animal quite through, and then suspend the carcass so as to allow all the blood to run out. They were forbidden to eat flesh not thus drained of its blood: &quot;Te shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye oat any flesh, that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.”—Ex. 22: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only might not the Israelite himself eat blood, but the most stringent laws were laid down that none of the strangers in the camp might eat it: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And whatsoever man there bo of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood, I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in Ilie blood: and I .have given it to you upon the al-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BnooKtyK, X. X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall cat blood, neither shall any stranger that so-journeth among you eat blood. And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth an.I eaieheHi any beast or fowl that may be eaten: he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dusk For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat. the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.—-Lev. 17:10-14.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>A Perpetual Statute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">It is 'noted that the prohibition against the eating of blood is particularly stated to be a perpetual one. It was to persist from generation to generation. The statement that the prohibition of the eating of blood is a perpetual prohibition is accompanied by like prohibition against the eating of fat, but an explanation is given regarding the fat. It was not to be eaten because •'■'all the fat is the Lord’s”. But no explanation is offered respecting the blood, at least not in the place, Leviticus 3:16, 17, where the perpetuity of the prohibition is enjoined. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of the Jews the eating of blood was associated with idolatry, and the possession of their promised inheritance was made contingent upon whether or not blood was a'part of their diet. Thus the prophet Ezekiel (33:24, 25) asks a question the answer to which we are certainly given to understand would be in the negative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many; the land is given us for an inheritance. Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the taking of the blood of animals into the human system by eating it would be bound to exercise a deleterious effect upon future generations is as much a claim of the Scriptures as is the contention, by hosts of opponents of Jenner’s superstition that the tainted blood caused by vaccinations and sernmizations will curse posterity long after the vaccinators have passed from the scene. Deuteronomy 12: 23-25 says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life: and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. Thou shaft not eat it; thou shall pour it tip- : on the earth as water. Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after t'iiee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>What About Armageddon?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">When we see these scriptures, and note the emphasis with which these commands not to mingle human blood and animal blood are repeated over and over, we can but wonder what part the violation, the general and impudent violation, of the spirit of this command will play in the battle of Armageddon. Will those who have made and injected and suffered the injection of calf and horse serums into the human blood stream go scot free? We doubt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite likely there is some connection between the violation of human blood and the spread of demonism. We cannot suppose that the Creator had no reason for associating the two, and He has done so at least twice in His Word. One of these passages is in Leviticus 19: 26 and reads: “Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood; neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe limes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can it be that the general corruption and violation of human blood by serums of various sorts has provided a garden out of which, in Armageddon, will grow, and do now grow, the most monstrous conditions of accord with the Devil and his angels, with their vibrations, their ways of doing things, if you please, that have ever taken place on this planet? It looks as if it might be so, and as if we were just beginning to find it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let no one hide behind the thought that the laws given to the Jews have no application to anybody now. In the New Testament it is deserving of particular notice that at the very time when the holy spirit declared by the apostles that the Gentiles are free from the yoke of circumcision, abstinence from blood was explicitly enjoined (Acts 15:28, 29), and the action, thus prohibited was classed with idolatry and fornication. This plainly suggests that much of the looseness of our day along sexual lines may be traceable to the easy and continued violation of the divine commands to keep human and animal bldod apart from each other. &quot;With cells of foreign blood racing through his veins man is not normal, not himself, but lacks the poise and balance which make for self-control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Sacredness of Human Blood </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Cluirles A. Pattillo</span><span class="font5"> (La.)' </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(reasons why vaccination is unscriptural)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font5">INCE vaccination has become a topic for discussion,. I cannot restrain myself from writ-b’g you iu regard to this great evil. The vaccination law cannot be a just law. Every father and mother ought to have a right to say what should be done to the body of their own child; yet the vaccination law reduces the father and mother to mere slavery, almost as bad as the colored people were in, when their children were put upon the block and sold. In many slave-sale cases the mother and father were even forbidden to shed tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Vaccination is a direct violation of the everlasting covenant that God made with Noah after .the flood. In Genesis 9:1-17 we read: “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon she earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and ■with your seed after you: and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and. of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood, neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and .you, and every living creature that is with you, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perpetual</span><span class="font5"> generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 'And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember’ my covenant, which is between me and you, and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This covenant not only involves the entire human family, but also includes every other living creature upon the earth. (See Genesis 9:10,12.) So important was this covenant that God placed His bow in the clouds as an everlasting reminder of the danger of its violation. There are two things that God, in this covenant, forbids man's doing. One is, that man shall not take the blood of the beast internally; and the other is, that he shall not shed the blood of his fellow man.. If lie should violate this law, then, by man should his blood be shed. As the beast was included in this covenant, its blood could in like manner be shed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All reasonable minds must conclude that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with. the blood of man. Not only has man shed the blood of his fellow man unlawfully, hut he has taken the body of the beast and unlawfully polluted its blood with poison and afterwards taken this blood and injected it directly into contact with the blood of the man, in the name of vaccine and antitoxin. To my mind, this is a violation of the law of God, in the most degrading manner possible to conceive of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this has met with the divine disapproval we are told in the twenty-fourth chapter of Isaiah, fifth verse, “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.” The ‘'''ordinance” of God, or the divine rule by which, man should be governed, is laid down in this covenant. Not only has man violated this law, but he has changed the ordinances of God by trying to make them read so as to justify his wicked acts. No doubt there are numbers of people who will try to justify themselves in the violation of this law. But the man who violates the law of God in the least, and tries to justify himself in the act, is far more reprehensible, in the sight of God, than the man who. commits the act and confesses afterwards that he did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord has said, &quot;As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26) In Noah’s day it was the introducing of unnatural blood into the blood of the human family, by the rulers, that brought the divine disapproval and caused almost the entire destruction of both man and beast in the flood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God made this covenant with Noah directly after the flood, indicating that its violation might bring upon the human family a. destruction similar to that of the flood. Wo do know that the Lord says that because of the \lolation of this covenant there will be comparatively-few.....<sub>:</sub>~<sub>s</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">men left. (Isa, 24: 6) The human race today.is facing the worst trouble that was ever known ' to man, and it is the solemn duty of every Bible student to warn his fellow man against the violation of this law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have myself lied to no man that I know of. If I have taken a penny from, my fellow man unlawfully, I am willing to give him two. If I have wronged my fellow man in any way, I am willing to correct it. I do not want to take upon, myself any honor that belongs to God. For the past fifteen years I have stood firmly for truth and justice as the only road to life, peace and . happiness.

<p><span class="font5">The most sacred, thing on earth in the sight o£ God is human blood, &quot;for in the image of God made he man.” (See Genesis 9:6.) God destroyed the entire human race, except Noah and his family, at the time of the flood, because of unnatural pollution of human blood. He then entered into a covenant with Noah that involved every living creature that lived upon the earth. That covenant was based almost entirely upon the sacredness of the blood of man in the sight of his Aiaker. The man that makes it his business to pollute the blood of man. with all manner of filth taken from the blood of animals is committing one of the most criminal offenses toward God that was ever committed by man. It is not known the suffering to which this act may yet lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God grant that the people may be awakened to the giving of this matter a more careful consideration.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Vaccination—Why Not?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font5">F ALL the inventions that have been foisted upon mankind for their defilement the most subtly devilish is that of vaccination. But in order to fully appreciate this fact we must have an understanding of what vaccination really is, and its effect upon the human, system. Many have come to realize that it is a healthwrecking practice, and some have attempted a measure of explanation why, but these explanations, in the main, have still left their question marks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several years ago the theory was advanced that the weakening after-effects of vaccination were due to bovine cell graft. This theory at the time seemed to be a very satisfactory explanation. But since then other question marks have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tn the first place, the human system as it is today is in a general cell-hybrided state, due to generations of meat eating. The effect of this has not been a detrimental one to .the general •health, but it has let down the gates of the system to a quick aging process, and also greatly limited man’s mental functions. The human system' is the most finely developed, and thereby the most respondingly sensitive to influences, of any life created upon the earth. This is a necessary essential for a foundation of eternal youth, which even science now declares not to lie a remote impossibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of its extreme sensitiveness to influences it appeared reasonable that during the process or course of the vaccine disease a cell graft from the animal from which the vaccine serum w<sup>7</sup>as taken would result in some of the sensitive glands of the system. This while remaining would have a tendency to unbalance the vital functions. But granting that such a cell graft takes place, and as this graft is not</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>By IT. Sillaivay (Tennessee)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">in itself a disease, the question arises, What influence holds this bunched graft in the system after* the disease that planted it has run its course ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There would appear to be several reasons for questioning the soundness of the original bovine cell graft theory in vaccination. But these we will not here take the space to discuss in detail, except the one line of evidence which we believe has led up to true solution. And in reaching this the original bovine cell graft theory has been a stepping stone, for the theory has not been totally wrong.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Syphilitic Symptomal After-Effects</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">There is a striking similarity in the aftereffects of vaccination to the constitutional derangements resulting from venereal syphilis. The only comparative difference would seem to be a usual absence of the marked scrofulous symptoms often met with in sufferers from this disease. So marked has been this similarity that it has attracted the attention of many who have hastily jumped to the conclusion that this is the result of venereal syphilis inoculation. The strong syphilitic symptoms that are often so conspicuous as an aftermath of vaccination have in the past been charged to syphilitic blood taint in the individual furnishing the foundation disease filth for vaccine cultures. But there are strong reasons for doubting that these symptoms are often if ever the result of such blood taint. The fact is that syphilitic symptoms are altogether too common as an after-effect of vaccination; which would indicate, if the blood taint theory is true, then practically only those who have venereal syphilis blood poison are selected to furnish the foundation disease filth for vaccine cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are really two distinct classes of disease germs. For convenience we will designate these as class A and class B. Class A includes all germs of diseases that have no tendency to immunize the sufferer from them from future attacks of the same disease. This class includes such germs as typhoid, malaria, pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc. Apparently the majority of these have their incipient rise or creation outside or independent of the human system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Class B includes all disease germs of diseases which usually immunize the system from a second attack of the same disease. While the various diseases of class B differ widely in their symptoms! effects upon the system, -yet there seems to be a distinct relationship between practically all germs of this class, in that apparently they all have the same incipient foundation in their creative development. Their creative start would appear to be within the human system itself upon a filth foundation. This is a well known fact as to the incipient start of venereal syphilis. This disease has its start in rank sex. immorality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All disease spores or germs are a form of life. As the germs of class B are seemingly beyond question fertilized into life existence by the gland secretions of the .human system or other animal .life, it would appear that a ravz or inflamed surface is essential to bring the parent germs into existence. Thus in smallpox, which has its recognized beginning in human filth, some skin eruption would seem to be necessary to give the germ its element of the human cell foundation necessary to its first life start. As this fertilization of smallpox spores is apparently through, the medium of the sensitive glands of the skin, the disease in its eruptive phase is confined principally to that part of the system. The particular organ or gland which fertilizes the germ into life gives each kind of germ its own peculiar characteristic in disease effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While it is not a proven theory, yet there is strong evidence indicating that all or practically all contagious diseases which produce permanent cell changes of a cell graft nature in certain glands of the body, with an influence to immunize the system of the patient against a second attack of the same disease, have their creative rise in an individual of a syphilis blood taint. If this is true, then the degree of this blood taint would possibly have an influence on. the virulence of the resulting epidemic. Also, if this theory is true, then a, banishment of syphilis from the earth would do away with this class of diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lower animals are ordinarily immune from contagious diseases of the B class originating in the human system. However, on the other hand, there are certain diseases of animals of a contagious nature that are contagious to man when the spores of the disease come in contact with a raw or inflamed surface. Whether any of the contagious diseases of domestic animals are of class B the writer has been unable to determine. It is doubtful if any animal is immune from, syphilis germ contagion under certain conditions of contact with them. It is possible that some contagious diseases of domestic are merely an evolution of infections of a syphilis germ foundation through human contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cats have been blamed for diphtheria, but just how much foundation there is to this theory, if any at all, we are unable to say. Cats do not have diphtheria, and there is little question that the creative foundation of these germs is in the human system itself. But germs of some diseases appear to pass through evolutionary stages, in which one stage of their development is supposed to be through some of the lower animals, especially of the rodent class. It is therefore possible that diseased cats may play a. part in the intermediate evolutionary development of diphtheria germs.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Evolution and Eevolution of Germa</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Germ evolution through the medium of human ingenuity is the foundation of all serums. In the manufacture of vaccines the disease filth for its foundation is transmitted to the raw flesh of the animal selected as the victim of this barbarous practice. This is in nature a forced graft of the disease germ upon the system of the animal. But because of the fact that the lower animals are not subject to smallpox, or other contagions of class B peculiar to humans, for which the animal is used as the subject for serum cultmes, iho forced admittance of smallpox germ filth into its system will not in turn produce a case of smallpox in the animal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What results through this smallpox-infected sore is a blood-poison disease producing a fever and a putrid inflammation at the point, of infection. But the germs developed in the system of the-animal, from’ the siuaHpox germ swd uwnot smallpox germs, for in their development they undergo an evolution suitable to the foundation..</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">■ • * Were there no weakening after-effects from vaccination its practice might be regarded as merely a harmless-absurdity.

<p><span class="font5">But why call it by that name? There are the best of reasons for this. In fact its physical yv - effects upon the system, as far as they go, are i- ■■........practically identical with those of venereal syphi</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lis. In the second place, it is really a close cousin llivvto that- disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IE® - if correct in the theory that all germs of class ® ;c B. are in their incipient creation merely devolu-tionized offsprings from venereal syphilis, then f..........<sup>.</sup>.....<sup>:</sup>Wt is clear that in the destruction, of the devolu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tionized superstructure of these germs, through F® <sup>:</sup> their planting on a negative bovine soil, the re-j suit would be a corresponding evolution of the syphilis foundation, of the germ. The resulting germ would be nothing more or less than a mild form of syphilis of a bovine fertilized cross. The planting of this germ in the human system through vaccination results in a more or less permanent fixing of the disease taint in the system through a harmonizing graft derangement of the sensitive vital glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Venereal syphilis is transmitted to posterity through its graft in the glands of the procreative organs, thus contaminating their secretions. While vaccine syphilis does not appear to be transmissible in this manner, due to the fact there is no marked derangement of the procreative system through it, yet there is often unquestionably a weakened posterity as its result. In fact, in the short period of time since vaccination was launched upon the race there has been a marked degeneration both physical and mental seemingly traceable in no small way to no other cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Serums All Harmful</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no such thing as a harmless serum. All have a germ foundation created by human ingenuity that has a deranging influence upon the glandular system. Mere pus injected into the system is practically harmless unless blood poison sets up in the wound at point of injection. It is the evolutionized germs of devilish human creation that is the basic health-destroying; medium of the various disease serums of either class A or class B. Some are less harmful than others, but none are entirely harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The havoc already created by vaccines and other serums, especially those of class B, is appalling. And the worst of it is that they have been so subtle in their devitalizing influence that it has escaped the attention of the majority, who are deluded into believing they are gainers in health by the very process that is destroying their constitutional vitality and unbalancing their mental functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidence is not lacking that some of the sweeping epidemic diseases that were unknown before serum squirting became popular are the direct result of human germ tampering. In the candid opinion, of the 'writer, based upon this evidence, the epidemic of flu, which swept the world during the World War, had its rise in the wholesale vaccination and serum infection of the soldiers as its creative germ foundation in the germ-fertile conditions of the battlefields of Europe. There is no greater cause for alarm in our day than in the contagion epidemic possibilities presented in the germ experiments of serum specialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The physical after-effects of vaccination differ widely in the constitutional make-up of the individual. With some there is little of outward symptoms of its vitality-weakening effects, though undoubtedly there is some loss of constitutional vitality even in those cases not outwardly perceptible. With others this weakening effect is manifest only in an increased susceptibility to acute trouble. These are also apt to go harder with such. Others suffer permanent loss of health in varying degrees. Usually some time elapses between vaccination and the perceptible beginning of constitutional breakdown. This time varies from a few months to several years.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Its Dementalizing Influence</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">One of the noticeable marked effects of vaccination upon the human system is that of mental and moral degeneration. However, not all who are vaccinated perceptibly experience these degenerating influences. The reason for this is that the exercise of the mind and will in proper channels tends to resist dementalizing and moral degenerating influences. But sometimes even 'with such, dementalizing influences are too strong and insanity results. And insanity has had a tremendous impetus since vaccination and serum treatments became general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While vaccine syphilis does not appear to be inheritable, yet from the very nature of the effect of this disease upon the system it is apparent that ordinarily one under its effect could not parent as constitutionally strong offspring as otherwise. And while the parent might successfully resist any perceptible dementalizing influence, through habitual exercise of the mental functions in proper channels, yet it is reasonable to suppose that oftentimes the foundation strength of many of the higher and nobler reasoning faculties are so weakened as to be beyond the power of the parent to transmit in functioning strength to offspring. At any rate, it remains that the present generation is a sadly weakened one in these respects, and beyond question vaccines and serums are not altogether blameless for this deplorable condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• A. striking example of the mental and moral deteriorating influence of serums upon the human system is seen in the manifest results of serum squirting during the World War. There was more or less of a wholesale vaccination program carried out at the very time that through insidious v;ar propaganda the public mi&quot;.d wes inflamed with hatred and a desire to kill or have it done. This letting down of the bars of the finer and higher sentiments of human, nature left a foundation for free action of vaccine syphiliA influence upon the brain cells. This process, which is a gradual one, had full time to accomplish more or less fixed changes of a paralyzing nature in the higher brain cells, -with a corresponding fixing of the baser sentiments which were having full sway at the time this process was going on, before the war influence receded sufficiently to permit a return to normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very naturally this disease effect was dbbidldy ly more marked in those of youthful agCfflH' in those of more mature years. While through insidious influences the minds of the fully aged mature are capable of being warped for a timc-into an unbalanced channel, nevertheless the former crystallized mental attitude towards life apparently is a resistant influence toward these brain cell alterations that the unsettled minds of youth do not always possess. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As vaccine syphilis is apparently a disease cell graft in the sensitive glandular system, it is through this diseased nourishment from these glands that the finely organized and supersensitive higher brain cells are weakened and deranged. Undoubtedly the bovine cell twist of this graft has much to do in producing such a marked destructive influence upon menial strength and moral balance. The influence of the state of perfection and health of the ductless glands, and especially the thyroid, upon the moral nature and mental state of health of the individual is a well recognized fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There seems to be little question that the criminal tendencies of the present generation, so prominently manifest since the World War, have been influenced in no small part by the direct effects of vaccination upon the moral nature of that class of society who have failed to fortify themselves against it by wholesome ambitions and a cultivation of the nobler sentiments. It is the impulsive element of society with no direct aim in life who present an open mental f-umda ■ tion for this pernicious influence. And much evidence that serumization is having much to do in the increase of such an element and is heading the race into the inevitable abyss of physical and mental destruction, which.-;phlytte vine interference can forestall.- - <sup>::</sup>- ■ ■- -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The theory that vaccination results in a blood poison related to venereal syphilis is not a mere opinion. And while it is usually of a somewhat milder form, if has, nevertheless, an insidious weakening effect upon constitutional vitality and, what is even worse, an apparent influence towards mental deterioration. This influence in the young would in many cases naturally cause a moral reflex toward crime and immorality through a dulling of the moral senses in its paralyzing influence upon the higher brain cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There would seem to be but little doubt that the class of diseases represented by smallpox, chickenpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles and mumps have their creative foundation upon a syphilitic blood taint. That the outbreak of any of these diseases in a locality may start with an individual free from venereal blood poison is no evidence against the theory; for not only are there various ways in which one may come in contact with germs of these diseases, hut there is also an apparent law of germ evolution in which the germ may not be identified in its minor disease phases with the disease of another stage of evoluted development. Or the the process may be reversed and the germ experience a devolution in its disease-outbreak manifestation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a number of years the writer resided in a section of the country where sex morality was unusually high and where apparently there was hid little venereal disease and blood taint. This was back in the days when hygienic rules w'ere not generally observed and regular bathing not practiced by a large percent of the population. Owing to a heating and greasy diet the people of this • section were far from healthy. As the result they were in fact a continual prey to a plague, of tuberculosis, and pneumonia and typhoid were prevalent. But smallpox, diphtheria and scarlet fever epidemics were unknown there. . Occasional epidemics of measles and mumps were experienced, but territory isolation from these two easily spread contagions is practically an. impossibility. The freedom of this section from epidemics of the disease plagues above mentioned might have been altogether from other influences, but in my opinion had venereal ’disease been common or the practice of vaccination general there would not have been this freedom from these plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">people have an exaggerated idea of the s^pfanal effects of syphilis blood poison. They usually think of its victims as literally rotting alive. This is indeed true enough in its most virulent type, and especially when associated with mercurial poisoning, as it often is. But such cases are the exceptional ones rather than the general rule. It is very doubtful if syphilis ever progresses to third or tertiary stage, in which the bones of its victim rot, where the system is free of calomel or other mineral drugs or a mercury foundation. Where this disease does not progress into its secondary stage of surface sores and eruptions after the primary stage of it has run its regular course in its outward symptomal effect, there is often little to attract attention to the fact that one is suffering from syphilitic blood poison. The symptoms in these cases are practically identical with the symptomal after-effects of vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Venereal disease, though not as prevalent as formerly, is still more common than is generally supposed. Its victims, through shame, pursue a policy of silence in regard to the foundation of their physical ills and weaknesses, and their associates are seldom the wise. In fact, they have little chance to be, with an outnumbering percent, of people in almost every locality manifesting similar symptoms from after-effects of vaccination, and. the much similar symptoms often met with in cases of aluminum poisoning, now so common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Syphilis blood poison is. not incurable, though the method of its cure is of rather recent discovery. This method is through a prolonged total fast carried to an extreme limit. The scientific foundation behind this method is the complete elimination of all dead matter from the system, thus leaving the disease without fertilization, which leads to a breakdown of the cell structure of its graft in the glandular system. Bad secondary syphilis of long standing has been cured by this process. Vaccine syphilis should yield readily to this method of treatment, though in ordinary cases the fast would not necessarily need to be carried to the same limit as in severe cases of the venereal disease. Owing to the bovine element of its cell graft its hold upon the system would not appear to be as tenacious, and it is possible that one or two prolonged partial fasts in which fruit juices alone are allowed would do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children cannot ordinarily be put on a fast with impunity, and it should never be attempted without a competent authority in charge, However, as a general rule it will be found that children will gradually throw off this disease graft if kept rigidly on a diet of wholesome unrefined foods with an abundance of fresh fruits. In this diet but little meat, if any, should be allowed, and neither lard nor beef fats should be used as shortening in the foods used, as these leave an abnormal residue of waste in the system, which feeds the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In fact, added fats of all kinds should be used sparingly, and all greasy foods avoided. The strict adherence to this kind of diet by adults suffering from vaccine blood poison will in time wear it out. Overeating’ must be guarded against. But adults who have suffered a constitutional breakdown from this disease should remember that the sensitive glands of their system have suffered a more or less permanent deterioration as the result, and the banishment of the blood poison from their system may not always result in a return to their former rugged state of health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There would appear to be no question that the germ basis of all vaccine serums is merely a built-up germ on a syphilis foundation, which on introduction into the human system through vaccination results in derangement and deterioration of the sensitive glands. The sooner people wake up to this evident truth, the better off they will be. It is to be expected that serum squirting . enthusiasts among the medical profession will refuse to recognize this fact and will attempt to repudiate it with much show of learned wisdom. And the class of people who enjoy being fooled will continue to be fooled as long as the supposedly learned element engaged in the fooling business continue to ply their fool trades.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">URKEY NECK BEND! Did you never hear of it before? No? Well! Your education has been neglected. You shall hear of it now. It is in Kentucky.

<p><span class="font4">The books were dipped in crude oil, on account of which they burned rapidly. Dr. Tom Bedford, aged eighty-five, an elder of the church in Turkey Neck Bend was present and participated in burning the books. We were glad to learn that several families in that county had already burned their respective sets of books upon learning what error they contained. Mr. Rutherford boasts of a wider circulation for his books than, any other book in print, save the Bible only. He boasts of having sold forty-five millions of his books within seven years’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His agents will almost force one to take the books. They will take money for them if they can get it; but if they cannot get money, they will take eggs, potatoes, etc., and even “crippled hens” will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brethren, let us oppose Mr. Rutherford and rid the land of his books. I wish some day </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to see</span><span class="font4"> a burning of these books like unto that of Acts 19:19, when over twenty-seven thousand dollars’ worth were burned.

<p><span class="font5">Crude oil, Turkey Neck Bend, and a man present and sanctioning the burning who has probably not had a new idea in sixty years. How appropriate it all seems as terminating the old arrangement of things and bringing in the new.</span></p>

Sometimes the Brooklyn book-making plant turns out over 80,000 'books and booklets a day, and they are distributed as fast as made. The book-burning creates a market for many more.

If this is part of Christ’s kingdom, pray where is the Devil’s kingdom, of which lie boasted to Jesus, and of which the apostle says he is the ruler ?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark125"></a>How Prohibition Prohibits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font5">FTER having read Judge Rutherford’s masterpiece in booklet form, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prohibition;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">League of Nations,</span><span class="font5"> I .feel constrained to write a few lines to your worthy magazine on that subject from personal experiences. I might state at the outset that what I have to say could be verified by a notary, and witnesses procured to substantiate every statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am a traveling salesman and my business has taken me through eastern and midwestern states within the last three years. Mr. Doran, who was in charge of prohibition enforcement in the United States, recently made the public statement that the country is really dry, and I would like to say that “His Honor” is either very much misinformed or else willingly ignorant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being of German descent, naturally I like beer and other drinks in moderation; but I believe absolutely in temperance, not in prohibition. Having been located in California for several years, like many men I know, I had my regular bootlegger, -who would deliver a gallon of very good whiskey right to my door at $10 a gallon. This I used moderately. But when the time came 1 o'&quot; me to go east, not desiring to carry any with me, I decided to investigate here and there to get </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">few sidelights on the above question, besides some beverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My first stop of any length was in Detroit. Locating a friend in the little suburb of Ecorse, where I was to stay, I decided to go out there and familiarize myself with the town. Having looked Detroit over I caught the jitney which was to take me to Ecorse. Incidentally I asked the jitney driver where I might get some real Canadian beer and whiskey. He replied that that was easy, just to stay on the bus and he would lake me to the best place in towm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;While passing through Ecorse, he showed me about 150 boathouses built exactly alike on the bank of the Detroit River about 250 feet from Canada. He explained that these houses were ■built alike for a purpose and were operated by a big<sub>:</sub> bootlegging company who loaded their contraband purchase into boats on the Canadian shore and, when the coast was clear, proceeded with full speed headed for the boathouses, the doors' of which practically all opened at the same time. After the boat had entered, the doors closed. Should the federal men who had not received pay pursue the boat they were blocked because they could not enter any of them without a search warrant for a certain one, and by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By C. 'J. Cameron (California} </span><span class="font5">the time this could be secured, the boat was entirely unloaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We proceeded on to Wyandotte. On the main street, as we drove along, my newly-made friend, the jitney driver, pointed out about thirty or forty saloons, or “blind pigs”, as they are called, but said he was taking me to the man who was on the square and serves only Canadian goods. This I found to be true, for he ran an orderly place which was exactly like many of the preprohibition saloons. It was open, so anyone could walk in and buy as though there were nothing to prohibit. The proprietor of this saloon I came to know fairly well as a good-hearted sort of chap who did not wish to do anyone harm, but, desiring to make an honest, living, chose this as his course. One evening while I was in this place three men entered ordering drinks. One remarked that he had purchased a launch and intended to bring over a few loads from Canada. I was informed they were railroad detectives. (What a wonderful prohibition law!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The proprietor took me out one evening in his car, and. as we drove toward Detroit he show<sup>r</sup>ed me many places run more or less openly “under protection of the law”, as he called it. One place he showed me where 20,000 cases of whiskey were stored. We went to a fashionable cabaret which had a very nice dining room and a bar in connection where any order could be had. He told me of the many ways in w’hich the bootlegging business is being carried on. Many of the better-class places in Detroit receive genuine Canadian beer in barrels, and others receive malt in five-gallon wood-covered cans, like the old molasses cans, and this was brewed and bottled to serve in some room near the speakeasy. He showed me many places in the heart of Detroit conducted, as he termed it, “under the law.” He told me of the bootleggers’ organization who had men appointed to get in touch with the law or federal agents, and who under federal and police protection would bring in boatloads from Canada. I also heard of a man ■who kept his supply under his house, which was not high enough for a man, so his seven-year-old boy was appointed to the job of carrying it under and out again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My work later took me to Toledo, Ohio. Of course, I &quot;being a stranger, a business friend, desiring to show me around, took me to a very fine residence in a fashionable part of town and we entered unannounced through the side door to the basement. There to my surprise was a regular barroom operating in the old-fashioned way except for license, etc. And my friend counseled me, if I wished some good corn whiskey, to go to a certain grocery store which he mentioned and hand them his card and I could procure same at $5 a gallon. I was informed such places ‘run into the millions’ in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other cities -where I traveled I found the matter of procuring good liquor only a task of fifteen to thirty minutes’ inquiry. Walking down a street in Salt Lake City I saw a man sitting on the veranda of an adobe house, and sat with, him because the day was very warm. Our conversation drifted to the all-important subject of prohibition. He informed me that if I desired lie could take me to a respectable place. We found a private residence where various kinds of liquor were being served. Before I left town, the oil station man where I had my car serviced told me a gallon could be delivered for my desert trip toward California. I paid for same on delivery and journeyed on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On my arrival in Oakland and San Francisco I became acquainted with a number of business men who boasted of having wine cellars and a goodly supply of aged whiskey. Among these were judges and district attorneys, detectives, policemen, etc. In a hotel in San Francisco, to the stranger entering the barroom near beer was sold; but to regular customers, the beer with a percentage. Also, if one desired to go to a room adjoining the dining room, he could get something stronger. Or if his taste was more expensive he might be escorted to the second floor, where a regular barroom was. He might proceed with whatever his taste desired. Also, from this hotel delivery was made to one’s place of business or home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One clay as I stood In the barroom a big, burly policeman came in, walked through the side entrance, and another came in, both in uniform; and I was rather curious, thinking there would surely be a raid, but as they did not reappear I rather wondered at it. But as I glanced in the dining room the proposition became clear. I saw Mr. Policeman, disrobed of cap and coat, enjoying a big feed and everything that goes with it, beer, wine, etc. These men were receiving a portion of their pay for protecting this hotel man. Later I questioned the proprietor as to how he could continue running so open, and he replied that he had been fined a few times but his profit was so large that he could afford to pay fines and yet net himself a goodly profit. He said at that tim.fi he paid several hundred dollars a month for police protection. Truly this is the Devil’s kingdom. One of the all-important questions today before any man, whether he be policeman, politician, clergyman or financier, is Prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have cited only a few of my experiences during the past three years and I want to add that anyone who makes the statement that this country is under federal control of liquor is either ignorant or malicious. How wonderful it will be when, as set forth in Judge Rutherford's marvelous booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prohibition,</span><span class="font5"> they shall plant vineyards and drink wine thereof, not, as winebibbers, but as a health tonic. Truly Prohibition is of the Devil. I could speak of many more instances which are too numerous to mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I, for one, say, Hail for God’s kingdom which shall do away with the hypocrisy in the denominational church systems and give life to poor oppressed humanity! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark129"></a>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid Moistureless Air</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5"> AM prompted to write you, expressing deep gratitude for the way you have fearlessly exposed the evils of cooking utensils made of aluminum. We believe that you have been, the means of our attaining a better health condition in our family, and we have carried the story to others, with the result that they too are enjoying better health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, may we now offer a firm conviction regarding another health matter, with the request that if on investigation you find merit therein you will give space in your columns so That others may receive, the same blessing we have from knowing the truth about the air conditions in heated homes, offices, schools, factories, etc.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been thought true for years that a dry heat is the better condition. We are convinced that this is far from true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several years ago my husband was employed in a machine shop where the air was used over and over again, being forced by a large fan through live steam coils. No ventilation was provided. and we imagine that the air was devoid of ah humidity. Colds, grippe, influenza, hoarseness, and pneumonia made the rounds of the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After suffering from a severe cold my husband developed bronchitis and larynx trouble to such an extent that doctors advised that he was in the first stage of tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the coming of spring he overcame the trouble, but had recurrences from time to time each, year when the heat was turned on, getting so hoarse that he could scarcely whisper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' It was purely by accident that we learned the truth of how to live through the winter minus colds, etc. It came about when we were installing a new furnace in our home and one salesman stressed the importance of having an abundant supply of water passing through the air passage of the furnace so that moist air came with the heat. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wo installed this make of furnace and believe it has the right principle about the humidity, •but even this furnace manufacturer does not go far enough. People living indoors do not know what the humidity should be, as a rule, and have no way ©f determining what the humidity happens to be. Neither do they know how to correct the trouble if the air is known to be too dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every home or room in any closed building can have a small instrument known as a “hygrom-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">eter” hanging on a wall, which will advise the correct amount of moisture, which should be at least 50 percent to 80 percent. We saw rooms last winter with 3 percent, and the occupants were having colds continually. This hygrometer can be bought for a price under $3.00, and should be of the dial type, and not a wet bulb, as these are too hard to be read easily. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest offenders in making wrong air condition, among all the various kinds of heating systems, are the steam, hot water and vapor’ systems which, while giving good results, have no means of providing the moisture needed to keep the membranes in the air passages of the body ‘'lubricated’, with the result that these membranes are dried up, which allows disease germs to find ready lodgment in the nose, throat, and lungs. Mucus membrane is intended by nature to act in much the same way as sticky fly paper does in trapping flies; and if the membrane is allowed to dry, the germ has a much better chance to find lodgment and cause trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You can readily visualize that one sick person can spread enough disease germs to spread the same sickness among hundreds. Our schools, which do not pay much attention to proper humidity, are a breeding place for all manner of disease, the children taking home, and from the class room to others elsewhere, these same germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hot air heating system offers the easily controlled humidity condition, but with any system it is possible to boil water on a stove, allowing the steam to go into the air. There should be in every home some means of telling just what the humidity is, and this ought to be a good hygrometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is still another reason for having the correct humidity: the matter of fuel saving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With a correct humidity of 65 percent one will be warmer (feel wanner) at 70 degrees than with a temperature of 75 with 5 percent humidity. The saving in the fuel will be obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another advantage exists in higher humidity, this being in the keeping down of dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another side is that it prevents dried-out furniture, cracking paper on walls, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I trust that the foregoing will help in the elimination of some of the troubles people have to contend with when the fires are lighted in the fall, and through winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be hoped that this will be the means</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of starting a good work which will bless all who all matters having to do with harmful results read and who heed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the manner in which man lives, should be</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Radio Tubes Are Priced Too High </span><span class="font5">IT HAS been my privilege during the past summer and fall months to visit farmers and urban families residing- in four different counties in the state of Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being interested in radio educational service, I always inquire if there is a radio set in the home and if they are receiving certain educational programs. Their replies have given me some information which tends to show that there exists in the receiving end of the radio business what amounts to what one might call a “big leak”. A “big leak” in the effectiveness of this way of advertising, spreading knowledge, etc. I believe that I am fairly stating the matter when I venture the information that practically one out of every five radio sets in rural homes just now is silent, dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In small towns the ratio is a little lower, perhaps one in seven sets, and in the cities about one in nine sets is “dead”. Some big radio-set manufacturers are now boasting that they have turned out “'two million” sets, “three million” sets, etc. No doubt by now there are over six million sets in the homes of the people of the United States alone. Perhaps one million dead sets out of six million would be too high an average. One dead set in every ten, according to information I have, might be more reasonable; but to be generous, let us say that five hundred thousand homes in the United States alone have sets that are absolutely unproductive to the high-priced radio advertising efforts: market reports, weather reports, speeches by the nation’s president, and others, educational programs, notices of escaped prisoners or bandits, robbers, etc., new<sup>T</sup>s flashes, and a host of other items that radio lias included in its service to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five hundred thousand “dead” sets. Two million purchasers of soap, meats and cereals, bread and food in general, amusements, carpets, furniture, clothing, automobiles, refreshments, etc. Some leak!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps the radio advertisers would like and appreciate a little information regarding this “big leak”, this “poor compression” when he is trying to get somewhere with, his radio-advertising dollar. Here is the main reason, as I have</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>By Donald 'Abernethy (Washington)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">found it, for this condition of affairs. One is told that “our radio set isn’t working” or “hasn’t been working for some time”. What is the matter? “Oh, one or two tubes are blown out, burned or -svorn out.” Why don’t you replace them? “Well, you see, when one of our electric lights goes out, we’ve just got to purchase another globe, and that’s what we do, at a reasonable cost to us, and then we can at least read the advertisements in the newspapers. Then if the lights in the family auto go out, wo buy some more, at least enough so that we can use -old faithful’ to go down and purchase what we see advertised in the newspapers. But when a couple tubes in our radio burn out, well, ‘'it’s just too bad.’ We feel we can do without what the radio programs have to offer when they hold the price of radio tubes so high that you have to sell a<sub>: </sub>pig or a heifer every time you want to replace one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I do not believe the radio corporations could find a more effective way of diminishing' the power of the radio advertising dollar than, by-holding the price to purchasers of tubes at a figure practically prohibitive to many owners of radio sets. Twenty to thirty cents for a new bulb for “'old faithful”, forty cents for a new light globe for the living room, but two to three dollars and a half for an even smaller tube for the set. Well, the gap is too great! Even if they do have a lot more “insides to ’em” than the common house globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Editor, it’s about time some of those electrical -wizards got busy and gave us a„good efficient radio tube for, say, about eighty-five Or ninety cents. Let’s not say it can’t be done. It can and will be done unless those that control the manufacture of radio tubes wait too long and foolishly obsolete the whole radio business. Someone has said: “Necessity is the mother of invention.” If the necessity of reaching “dead set” owners some other way is felt strong enough, some bright inventor will invent some* thing to take the place of the dead sets. Then who will be the loser? Perhaps in the near future the old phonogra£)h up in the attic will have to share up will) the old dead-tube radio set.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark133"></a>The Great Aluminum Way to the Graveyard </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By E. W. Symondson (New York)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">UST recently, thanks to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> a strong and clear-cut argument has been built up against the use of aluminum for cooking purposes. Each day someone is finding out that food cooked in those nice clean-looking aluminum pans is as good as a through ticket to the cemetery, by express at that. Since I nearly provided the undertaker with a little extra business a short while ago via the aluminum non-stop route, I thought maybe the facts might be interesting to all who want to get well and keep well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dating the summer of 1926 I returned home ■after working away for a long time. And at home aluminum 'was very prominent in the kitchen. Well, soon after this I used to get terrible pains in the stomach, as well as a perpetual sore throat. This was all the more remarkable as I tried to watch my diet as much as possible to try to prevent the pain, which usually left me flat on the floor without much interest in life. Still nothing seemed to do any good, so-called ‘■'medicine” least of all. Then one day I read in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> of aluminum and the chemicals released into food when cooked in it. This seemed so reasonable that I tried to do without aluminum whenever possible, with the immediate return of a large amount of the pep that I didn’t expect to have again. I didn’t completely knock off aluminum; hence I didn’t get completely well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About a year later my mother, who up to that time had had very good health, got the same trouble as I had. This increased so rapidly that three months later, in the spring of last year, she was taken to the hospital, where an immediate operation for cancer was advised. This was carried out, and three days thereafter she was dead. No satisfactory details could be obtained at the hospital as to the primary cause of her death. Of course not. Who would take the trouble to look for traces of aluminum poisoning in the organism of any one who had died of such a well-known ‘incurable disease’ as cancer? Certainly not the M. D.’s, at any rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A little later I left home to have a share in spreading the grandest message on earth, and from then on wouldn’t eat food cooked in aluminum at all. The result was like magic. I never felt so well before, and since then have never had to grovel about in the dust like some “poor heathen Chinee”. Hero’s one that’s off aluminum for life, anyway, even if the aluminum trust </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">does go</span><span class="font5"> on raking in its dividends. When telling of Jehovah’s way to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font5"> health and happiness I’ve often noticed how ill some folks look, and a little inquiry usually reveals the fact that a set of brand-new honest-to-goodness aluminum saucepans is reposing gracefully in that home. Sometimes those pans leave home hurriedly after a little talk; sometimes they remain. On more than one occasion I have been, “wicked” enough to get a real “kick” out of taking money put by for buying aluminum in exchange for Judge Rutherford’s books that show the time is just ahead when there’s to be no more sickness or death, but real radiant health that will be free to all. And it isn’t coming the aluminum way either, nor yet the serum-makers’ way, nor even the preachers’ way. Turn to Isaiah the thirty-fifth chapter and read about it for yourself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s Victory in Brantley County, Georgi</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N THE month, of June one of the colporteurs of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, M. O. Zeliff, 74 years of age, was arrested in Brantley county, Georgia, charged with “not being a bona fide student earning ' his way through school or college and without first applying for, taking out and obtaining a license to sell books”, under a possible penalty of a fine and six months in jail or twelve months on the chain gang, or both, if found guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ease came up for trial in the November term of court. The attorney engaged had in the meantime become despondent over the case. The remainder of the story we take from the report of the regional service director, Anton Koerber, sent by Judge Rutherford to look after the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•‘After a brief conference with Garrett, I agreed with Zeliff. Garrett was so sure of a conviction, I was persuaded to dismiss him, have the case postponed, and secure another attorney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After prayerful consideration, I decided upon, the following course: Prepared a statement of facts covering the points we desired to be brought to light at trial, and placed these before Garrett mid frankly asked if he would back us in getting these points before the jury, regardless of his personal opinions. He replied that he would. We then laid out the procedure for the following day at. trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The trial proceeded as follows: A jury was selected. I instructed Garrett to replace two preachers on the jury, which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Solicitor General (the prosecutor) had four witnesses testify that they had purchased books from Zeliff, the same not being Bibles, etc., trying to show that Zeliff was an agent or canvasser and that his acts came under the Revenue .Act as per attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■'After the prosecutor finished their side, Garrett, asked the court to ‘quash’ the case on the grounds the prosecutor had shown no relationship between the defendant and Society and could not he classified as an agent or canvasser for said organization. The court overruled the motion, and case proceeded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I had instructed Garrett to call me first, then the defendants; but lie called Zeliff to stand. fii.=t, advising me afterward that such was a eus-iiiilliyipiliedure here. The witnesses are sworn in and sectioned off: so the privilege of sitting at counsel’s table to confer with him during trial was denied.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">3.12</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now the law here is that the 'defendant cannot be questioned or cross-examined. He simply testifies without interruption until finished, then is dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Although Zeliff was not well he bore up remarkably under the severe strain of the trial, which to him was a real trial. Garrett requested me to make up a short schedule of the ground he was to cover briefly,-and to go over it witli him; which I did. But when the time came for him to take the stand he was so enthusiastic over his opportunity to give a good witness that lie proceeded to deliver a discourse on immortality, and did very well at it, too. I tried to flag him after a while, but to no avail; he was too enthusiastic over his subject to be cut off suddenly. Finally, Garrett stopped him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I then took the stand and covered the points formerly outlined with Garrett in a prepared statement of facts covering the points as you instructed, showing how and when the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was organized, its purpose, that it, together with the Peoples Pulpit Association and the International Bible Students Association, is a benevolent, charitable, and religious organization within the meaning of those terms, therefore is exempt from taxation; that neither the officers nor any of the Society operate for a pecuniary profit, but all engaged in this work, including the defendant and other such witnesses, go from house to house preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, at a sacrifice to themselves, because of their love for Jehovah their God, and love for their fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Had arranged for Garrett to ask questions which would further show our method-of approaching the people, and why it was essential, particularly in this day of trouble, for the people to understand God’s message of deliverance. He stuck fairly close to the program, showed increased interest, and defended the ease before the jury, in his resume, better than I expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the meanwhile the Solicitor General had many questions relative to who we were, the work being done, and contents of the books. He would ask one question after another, not disputing the authenticity of the answers,- as I-would cite Scriptures for authority. It developed into a regular question and answer meeting on th'' It was almost like a class meeting, Ha asked the very queslinns we wanted to get he-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After admonishing the prosecution, a mini-her of times, to stick to the question at issue, ■relative to t'he Revenue Act, the judge angrily stopped the Solicitor and asked the questions 'himself. His first question was: 'These books are Judge Rutherford’s interpretation of the Bible, are they not ?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I replied, in substance, that the Bible is of no private interpretation. Jehovah is His own interpreter. He caused the prophecies in the Bible to be written as a record foretelling His purposes. H.e alone can bring them to pass and docs always fulfil His promises. A Christian is commanded to watch for the fulfilment of God’s prophecies; and when in process of fulfilment, the faithful watchman will testify accordingly to others, calling attention of all men to the mighty acts of Jehovah. Thus they are God’s witnesses which He foretold. These books contain the message that God’s kingdom is at hand. The defendant and other witnesses of God use these books as a means of making God’s message in the Bible plain by comparing physical facts vrith Jehovah’s written purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•■'The judge then asked other questions, and did the very thing he rebuked the Solicitor for. We had other witnesses, but the trial had been in progress for three hours; so the case was closed. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘'Garrett summed up the case before the jury, pleading for religious liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘'■'The Solicitor General made a few<sup>7</sup> remarks consistent with his vocation; but at one time he was so absorbed in portions of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance, </span><span class="font5">to prove his point to the jury, that he was arguing in our favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The judge, in charging the jury, stated that regardless of whether we were right or not in the religious discussion, if the defendant bad violated the Revenue Act, although it be without malicious intent, then he was guilty; therefore if the jury so found, they should bring in a verdict accordingly. The jury then retired. They returned in about fifteen minutes with a verdict of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Not guilty''.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then things began to happen. All kinds of wild stories about the Bible Students had been circulated by the clergy; so by trial time the court room was packed. About 350 were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Many of these, together with the jury, flocked around and wanted the books. I delivered all we had, took orders for .others, and turned orders over to local brethren there, so people would know Jehovah had witnesses in that place. Then Zeliff immediately left for his territory, rejoicing in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While the jury was out I had a fine talk with the judge about our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One of the many incidents was, there was a judge on the jury of twelve men selected to decide our ease. During the trial a messenger brought word that his son had been killed; so he was excused. The case was finished with eleven men. Learned later he was opposed to our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Solicitor obtained some of our books; and we were assured by the judge, and many others, that we were welcome in Georgia any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It was on Thursday, November 27. What a Thanksgiving Day I The Lord heard our prayers, and His angel maneuvered the case to honor Jehovah’s cause.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH has made it clear by His Word that following the expression of His righteous indignation against Satan and his organization He will heal and reconstruct the human race. That will be a happy time for mankind. It will not do, however, to pass by the terrible trouble that will shortly come upon the world without giving it due consideration. The people and nations of the earth are certain to experience that trouble. Jehovah causes notice of the coming storm to be given to the rulers and to the people, and manifestly His desire is that they may know why it comes. While it is natural for man to wish to escape trouble, the world cannot escape that which is just ahead. The matter should be viewed calmly, and then with eagerness the people should seek information divinely provided that consolation may come to those who are in distress. The fact that the great trouble will be the last should bring some comfort to those who understand, and should enable them to meet the approaching conditions courageously and to bravely hold to that which is truth. That the great battle of Armageddon will completely wreck Satan’s organization, the visible part of which is described under the symbol of “the earth”, is made certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Isaiah 24:19 it is written: “The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.” That the people will suffer and will know that such oppressive condition is done and will never come again is made certain by the words of the prophet (Isa. 24:20): “The earth shall reel to and fro like a. drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.” That the people will be utterly at their wits’ end as to what to do for themselves is also made certain by the words of the prophet (Ps. 107:27): “They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.” Having some knowledge of the great Jehovah. God their desperate condition will cause the survivors of humanity to humbly cry unto Him for help, and He will render to them necessary aid. “Then they cry unto the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be cpiet</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; so</span><span class="font5"> he bringeth them unto their desired haven.” (Ps. 107:28-30) Not only w’ill the Lord stay the storm of trouble, but He will put forth His loving hand and heal the afflicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When all mankind were sinners and all were alienated from God His love for poor suffering humanity was so great that He gave His only beloved Son to die that the people might have an opportunity to live. With stronger reasoning, then, will He manifest His love for all those who humbly seek His hand of favor when the great storm of trouble has ended. It is written that the people will then learn to say (Ps. 136: 26): “0 give thanks unto the God of heaven : for his mercy endureth for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the end of the storm of Armageddon there will be on - earth many sad and broken hearts. Those, however, who have some knowledge of Jehovah will look beyond their trouble and seek His favor. His prophet said: “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.”—Ps. 147: 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Jesus taught His followers to pray for the coming of the kingdom of God that God’s will might be done on earth as it is done in heaven, so will those people of honest heart pray for divine help. By His prophet God records this prayer: “'God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.” (Ps. 67:1, 2) Nothing will then be so- much needed by suffering humanity as a complete reconstruction of mind and body and of the governmental affairs of the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Certainty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The reconstruction of the human race and the full restoration of man to perfection is a tremendous task; but the accomplishment thereof is an absolute certainty, because God has given His Word it shall be. The great ivork will be accomplished in God’s due time and in His own good way. The Scriptures and the facte show that the blessed time of reconstruction wfil soon begin. The Apostle Peter describes the complete destruction of Satan’s organization or world, which is made up of the invisible and visible parts called ‘heaven and earth’, and then</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">adds: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) The “heavens” represent the new government of Jehovah invisible to man, while the “earth” represents the organization of the peoples of earth that participate in carrying out God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has given His Word and thereby expressed His purposes. His Word shall not be void, but shall accomplish His purposes and bring to pass all He has said. For the benefit and encouragement of those who seek the truth He has caused His prophet to write, in Psalm 96:10: ‘The world shall be established, that it shall not be moved: and the Lord shall judge the people in righteousness.’ The ‘establishment of the world’ necessarily means a complete reconstruction of governments. Concerning God’s loving-kindness and His goodness to those who seek to know and to do His will it is written: “For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.” (Isa. 57:15, 18) The healing necessarily means reconstruction, or bringing- about a happy condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reconstruction means to make over again or make anew. The reconstruction of the human race means to restore mankind to perfection of mind and body and put within man a pure and honest heart. One of the primary purposes of the new world is to heal, reconstruct, and restore the people to strength of body and perfection of manhood. The great ransom sacrifice provided by the death and resurrection of Jesus forever removes the disability which came upon all men by reason of Adam’s sin, and opens the -way for restitution. The overthrow of Satan’s organization will remove the power that hinders complete reformation and reconstruction,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unaided</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some will ask, Could not man by his own efforts bring himself back into a state of harmony with God and advance himself to perfection? The evolutionist preachers say, “Yes; man is lifting himself up and will continue to lift himself up, and the mental arid moral achievements of men, all of which will be realized by his own efforts, will bring about a perfect condition.” How foolish to so conclude! Such a conclusion is supported neither in reason nor in the Scriptures. It is necessary only to glance at the history of man and then take into consideration his present unhappy condition to know that it does not lie within man’s power to bring himself up to an ideal state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must be borne in mind that for more than six thousand years the human race has been traveling the broad road of unrighteousness that leads to degradation and destruction. After such a long period of sin and debauchery the race is wicked and depraved. Visit the-slums of the great cities and gain some idea of the rice, immorality, corruption and wickedness that are practiced there. Observe the filth and muck, and poverty-stricken conditions. Note those afflicted with loathsome disease, the weak of mind, the wretched, the lame, the halt and the blind, all herded together in a small ill-ventilated hovel and without proper food or clothing. They have nothing elevating upon which to feed the mind. Many of them appear to have reached a state of almost total depravity. This is the result of the work of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Visit then the insane asylums, and there see hundreds of thousands whose minds are turned . entirely in the wrong direction, and who are blind to all reason and truth. This also is the enemy’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Go to the hospitals and there look with pitying eyes upon the lame and halt and blind and sick and afflicted. This, too, is the result of Satan’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Go into the prison-houses and observe the marks of crime upon the faces of poor unfortunates who there drag out a weary existence. This is the work of the wicked one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Visit the financial centers and see the harsh, cruel countenance of the profiteer who hesitates not to make war and hurry millions of youths into the trenches, there to meet an untimely and cruel death. This, too, is the work of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Make the rounds of the sweat shops, where poor widows, friendless girls, and impotent men labor under the most adverse conditions, to eke out a mere existence. This is the Devil’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider also the brothels, where once beautiful girls have been turned into demons by. reason-of evil practices. This is a part of the Devil’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Look deep into the salt pits and coal mines and there see poor miserable creatures, toiling in the darkness for a pittance that others might roll in wealth or earthly gain. This is a part of the Devil’s work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Go into the crowded streets and subways, the boats, the restaurants, the dance halls and like places and observe the young boys and girls, old men and old women, slaves to nicotine and drugs, momentarily breeding vice and crime. These things are also works of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take into consideration the abortive attempt to dean up America from the evils of intoxicating’ liquor, and the miserable failure that has resulted therefrom. No amount of law enactment or other methods could clean up the world and uplift the people. It is worse than foolishness to say that man by his mental and moral attainments can bring about an ideal or even a desirable condition. Something more powerful is needed; and that which is needed God has provided. Without this provision of Jehovah it would be impossible to restore mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ will not alone undo the results of the practice of wrongdoing that has been carried on for centuries. The complete destruction of Satan’s organization and his power could not help the human race and lift them out of degradation and back to a state of perfection. There is still something else that must be done. It is written: “Ue that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” (1. John 3:8) That great work of destroying Satan’s influence and power and the result of his wicked work must and will be done by and through the administration of the kingdom of God. That kingdom will be just and righteous, and the King possesses absolute and complete power and authority to carry out Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the evil kingdoms of this world and their passing away and the establishment of righteousness, it is written: “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” (.Dan. 2: 44) The fact that this kingdom of God will stand forever to the glory of God is a guarantee that it will accomplish the purpose of Jehovah in doing the great reconstruction work. For' this reason Jesus taught His followers to pray for the coming of the kingdom of God in order that God’s righteous will might be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God expressed His purpose of reconstructing the world when He said to Abraham: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 22:18) He expressly defined the “seed”, and said it is The Christ. (Gal. 3:16) It is written concerning Christ Jesus: “Thou art a priest, for ever after the order of Mel-chizedek.” (Ps. 110:4) That means that He is the great official Servant of the Most High God, to whom is committed the work of executing the purposes of Jehovah. One of the expressed purposes of Jehovah God is to establish the world in righteousness, and it is by and through the ministration of Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful ruler, that He will accomplish such work. By His prophet He said: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul de-lighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles ... .” ‘This honor will I not give to another.’—Isa. 42:1, 6, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such is conclusive proof that no man or company of men can reconstruct the world, but that the honor of so doing Jehovah gives to Christ alone. By the same prophet the .Lord further says to His servant The Christ (Isa. 49:8-10), T will preserve thee and give thee for a guarantee to the people to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of these clear and positive statements by the Lord in. His Word, why do the clergy mislead the people by telling them that by and through the League of Nations, world courts and peace pacts, and by the mental and moral achievements of men, the desired refermation and ideal condition can be brought about? Surely it should be manifest, to all pien who think, that, either the clergy who thus teach are wholly ignorant of what is in the Bible or else they do not believe what is contained therein. In either event they are unreliable advisers and should cease to call themselves ministers of the gospel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark139"></a>The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">I would waste neither time nor effort to mention the preachers merely as men, because I. have no quarrel with them. I call attention to their teachings, .which they place before the •people^ in order to show the people that these men are not safe moral guides. No man can afford to blindly follow teachings of another man or men. The obligation is upon each one to investigate for himself and ascertain what is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The kingdom of God through Christ, and that alone, can reform the people and entirely reconstruct the world and make the earth a place of fit habitation. If it is worth while to give any heed to the Bible at all as the Word of God, then let us take it for what it says and cease to listen to.the senseless babble and the schemes of selfish men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon earth today there is no righteous government. Furthermore, there has not been a righteous government amongst men; and this is due to the influence of Satan the enemy upon men. The purpose of God’s government through Christ is to undo the great wrong which Satan has wrought, and then to reconstruct the world. For the past six thousand years Satan has brought upon the peoples of earth great sorrow, suffering, and death. God through Christ will lift mankind out of that condition and reconstruct the world in a period of one thousand years. To'this end God. by His prophet says: &quot;i’m'.o us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall he called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and perne urn shall be no end .. . [He will] establish it with judgment and 'with justice, from henceforth even for ever.”—Isa. 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The very language of this scripture shows that God's kingdom is one of reconstruction and progression to the point of perfection, and that nothing shall hinder it. As further proof that His kingdom or government will be over all the earth, and operated for the reconstruction and building-gip of mankind He says by His prophet (Ps. 72:3, 4-): “'[His kingdom] shall bring peace to' the people « . &nbsp;&nbsp;. He shall judge the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•—All the faithful prophets of Jehovah foretold the coming of God’s kingdom and its constructive work and the great good it would do amongst men. By the Prophet Isaiah (32:1) it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt the king here mentioned by the prophet is Christ, who is the One whose right it is to rule the earth. (Ezek. 21:27) Othei’ scriptures show that there will be associated with Christ Jesus in that blessed work of reconstruction those who have been with Him in His trials which Satan has brought upon Christ and His followers. To such faithful ones Jesus said: “'Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” (Luke 22: 28-30) It is Christ Jesus, and His faithful associates in judgment, that will have power over the nations and establish the world in righteousness. (Rev. 2:26, 27) Christ, the King of glory, will rule in. righteousness, and His princes in judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wlio, then, are the princes mentioned by the prophet? A prince is one who acts in matters of government according to the supreme authority Conferred upon him by the higher power. The princes here mentioned will be the legal representatives of God’s kingdom on earth. Christ is a spirit, and will not be seen by human eyes. Provision is made that He shall have visible representatives on earth who will teach the people and lead them in the right way. Who then on the earth could be capable or worthy of such high honor arid upon whom all the people could rely? The Scriptures give clear answer to that question. In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews they are mentioned, many of them by name, and their deeds of faithfulness to God are recorded with approval. They lived on earth from Abel to John the Baptist, the last of the prophets. They all died in. faith and faithful to God. Never at any time did they compromise with 'Satan or any part of .his organization. Knowing that Satan is the enemy of Jehovah, and the wicked oppressor of man, and the god of this world, they held themselves entirely aloof from Iris organization. Never on any occasion did any of them call upon the president and offer to follow his lead in an. abortive attempt, to reform. the world and clean it up from crime. Those men- had<sub>;</sub>complete faith and trust in Jehovah God, and without' the slightest deviation from the path of rectitude they served Him. Never would they have anything to do with the politics of the world nor engage at any time in lobbying to influence the- legislative bodies to enact their pet laws. Knowing the corrupt condition of the world, they knew’ that man could not reform it. Having complete faith in God, with patience they looked forward to His kingdom on earth and devoted themselves entirely to His cause of righteousness. Because of their faithfulness to Jehovah it is written of them: “Through faith [they] subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong .... Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourg-ings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment : they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they ’wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.”—Ileb. 11: 33-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All these men died in faith and faithful to God. Jehovah God has promised that they shall have a better resurrection from the dead than many others. When on earth these men were called the fathers in Israel, because of their faithful devotion to Jehovah. When they come forth from the grave, however, they shall no longer be callefl such, but will be made governors in the world as the visible representatives of God’s kingdom. By His prophet the Lord says of them: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.”—-Ps. 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today a man is counted as of little value. The cruel profiteers barter in the property and the liberty and even the life-blood of men, that these selfish ones might gratify their greed. Under the reconstruction period of the kingdom of God the conditions will be entirely different. The faithful men who will then be princes in all the earth, and who will be leaders and teachers of the people, will have a proper appreciation of man. They will appreciate the fact that man is God’s creation and that his liberty, his property and his life are valuable, and even sacred. Today real manhood has almost disappeared from the earth. This is largely due to the fact that the cruel and selfish ones have browbeaten and oppressed the others so much that man has grown weak in moral courage. Under the reconstruction blessings of God’s kingdom there will be true men, their worth will be appreciated, and they will be a comfort and a joy to one another. Concerning that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">time, </span><span class="font5">through His prophet God says: “And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hoar shall hearken. The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.”— Isa. 32:2-4.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Time</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the time of reconstruction it is written: “Because he [God] hath appointed a day, in the which he ■will judge the world in righteousness by that man [Christ] whom Im hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” (Acts 17: 31) Christ was resurrected, and He ascended into heaven, and there He must wait until the end of the world, which panic in 1914. Then He was placed upon His throne, and He cast Satan out of heaven. He is now causing This gospel of the kingdom to be preached in the world for a witness’, and then will follow The battle of the day of God Almighty for the destruction of Satan’s organization. After that will follow’ the period of reconstruction. That such will be a blessed time is further assured by the words of the prophet: “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.”—Mal. 4: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here Christ is likened unto the sun which shall heal and bless the people. It will mean the time of restoration of all obedient ones of humankind to that which perfect man once enjoyed. Upon this point it is written that God will send Christ Jesus to restore all the things of which the prophets 'wrote. (Acts 3:20, 21) The proof is therefore conclusive, that the remedy for the ills affecting humankind is by and through the kingdom of God and that there is no other remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'What will be the benefits to the people dur- Lord, it will be my privilege and pleasure to ing that period of reconstruction? That ques- give the Scriptural proof of the benefits of tion is of greatest importance to every one. God’s kingdom that will be brought to all the Next Sunday morning, by the grace of the families of the earth.</span></p>

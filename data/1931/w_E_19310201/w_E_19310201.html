<p><span class="font5">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS </span><span class="font4">journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regu</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">larly </span><span class="font4">engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as tho fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed jsvith all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes tho “seed of Abraham” through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it is the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that the kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel of the kingdom must he preached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL FOR 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The beginning of the Jewish month Nisan, the “beginning of months” according to Jehovah, is dated from the appearance of the new moon nearest the Spring equinox, according to the authorities. Such new moon this year appears at 2: 51 a.m., March 19. The first day of Nisan would begin, therefore, at 6 p.m., that evening, which time of day is the beginning of the Scriptural Jewish day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence the fourteenth day of Nisan would commence at 6 p.m., April 1. It follows that the proper date for the celebration of the memorial of Jesus' death would be after 6: 00 p.m., Wednesday, April 1, 1931. That will be the time at which the Lord’s anointed ones will desire to assemble together at their respective meeting places and celebrate the memorial instituted by our Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Secretaries of classes are requested to report to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4"> immediately following celebration of the memorial, the number partaking in their respective places.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>HIS TEMPLE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.”—Hag. 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is pleased to encourage those who love him. Long ago he caused Haggai his prophet to deliver a message to his covenant people relative to the building of the temple at Jerusalem. The purpose of that message was to encourage Zerubbabel and those with him to finish the temple building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’God’s due time has now come for his “servant” to have a better understanding of this and other prophecies. Since it is positively stated that all scripture given by inspiration of God is for instruction that the man of God may be thoroughly furnished, and since it is clear that the man of God mentioned is the “servant”, there must be something in this prophecy for the “servant”. Furthermore it is stated in the Scriptures that whatsoever thing was heretofore written in the Lord’s Word was written for us (the “servant”) that we might learn and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures have a stronger hope. There is therefore a double assurance given that the prophecy of Haggai was a message sent from the Lord to encourage the modern temple workers or the “servant” class to finish the work which the Lord has provided for such to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> When the apostles were on the earth, and the visible leaders of the people of God, there was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> unity amongst the consecrated. With the end of the earthly career of these godly men that unity quickly passed away. It is now clearly seen that approximately from the year 1878 and forward the Lord Jesus Christ began to carry forward the work of preparing the way before Jehovah, and among other things he did was to restore the truth to the consecrated and to bring the faithful out from Babylon. Then followed the building up of Zion and the appearing of the Lord in his glory. (Ps. 102:16) It is certain from the Scriptures that the temple of God must be built of the “living stones” all of which are in God’s organization. It is wholly inconsistent to think that God has more than one general organization or that he would have on earth several divisions of his organization. God has one people on earth that are his, and at the present time there is unity between such. To those who are of God’s organization it is believed that the study of the prophecy of Haggai will now be of interest, encouragement and profit. Jehovah provides such encouragement for his own that they may continue faithful in his service until his due time to finish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Haggai was Jehovah’s messenger to bear, and did bear, to the people God’s message. (Hag. 1:13) This prophet speaks as he is borne along by the spirit of Jehovah. (2 Pet. 1:21) His name means “festive”, and is derived from the Hebrew word meaning ‘festival’ or ‘the sacrificial victim for the festival occasion’. In the following scripture texts the same Hebrew word is used concerning the festival sacrifice, to wit: “Yahweh is God, and hath shed on us light; bind ye the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar.” (Ps. 118: 27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Blow at the new moon the horn, at the full moon for the day of our sacred festival.” (Ps. 81:3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “A song shall ye have, as in the night of hallowing a festival, and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with the flute to enter into the mountain of Yahweh, unto the Rock of Israel.” (Isa. 30:29, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Lo! upon the mountains the feet of one who bringeth good tidings! who publisheth prosperity! Celebrate, 0 Judah, thy pilgrim festivals, fulfil thy vows, for not again any more shall the Abandoned [wicked] One pass through thee.”—Nah. 1:15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The name Haggai has a deep significance. It shows that the fulfilment of the prophecy is at the time that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus should be and are joyful in the Lord in anticipation of his gathering them together unto himself, and approximately at the time when these would enter into the joy of the Lord. It is at this time when these faithful ones are admonished to keep the festival unto Jehovah, presenting to him “the festal sacrifice”, binding it with cords of joy and leading it up to the horns of the altar. (Ps. 118: 27; Rom. 12:1) There was a desolate and mournful condition existing amongst the consecrated between the years 1914 and 1919, and it seems certain that this prophecy has its complete fulfilment shortly following that period of time. If so, then it is food which Jehovah spreads upon his table for those </span><span class="font4">35</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">who love him, and he permits them to feed upon it in the presence of the enemy; and thus doing, they are encouraged.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> In the year 536 B.C., Cyrus, the king of Persia, made a proclamation in which he stated of God’s people, the Israelites: “Let [them] go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel.’’ (Ezra 1:3) In the year 521 B.C., Darius the Persian succeeded this Cyrus as ruler of Persia. It was in the second year of the reign of this Darius, and approximately about the middle of August, that the Lord sent Haggai with this prophetic message. With the Jews it was then the vintage season when they would take an estimate of the blessings God had bestowed upon their fields and vineyards, and suggests a fulfilment of the prophecy at a time after much labor had been bestowed by the people of God upon the field and when the workers would take account of what God had done for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Acting under the decree and proclamation made by Cyrus the Jews returned to Palestine and began the rebuilding of the temple. The leaders in this work were Zerubbabel the governor, and Joshua the high priest. Those ‘ ‘ religious hybrids ’ ’ called ‘ ‘ Samaritans ’ ’ wanted to mix in the work of rebuilding the temple and thus defile it. Their proffered aid was positively refused; and it being refused, the Samaritans became the open adversaries of the Jews, interfered with the building operations, and hired counselors against the Jews to frustrate the work; and this opposition continued until the reign of Darius. The work on the temple was stopped for a period of sixteen years. This was due to the fear the Jews had of Satan’s world power.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> It has long been proverbial that ‘the law of the Medes and the Persians changeth not’. Here was an occasion, however, which marked an exception. The decree originally issued by Cyrus had evidently been overlooked at the time the Jews were caused to stop work, and if they had reposed complete faith in God and proceeded immediately to place their case before the king of Persia doubtless that ruler would have caused thorough search to be made of the records, which, if made, would have disclosed the decree of Cyrus ordering the work done and the work would have proceeded. This is exactly what was done in the second year of the reign of Darius the Persian. This action was taken, however, only after the prophets Haggai and Zechariah had encouraged the Jews to proceed with the building of the temple, and then it was done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> There appears to be a modern correspondency with the aforementioned historical facts. In the year 1914 Christ Jesus, the Greater than Cyrus, and whom Cyrus had foreshadowed, came to the throne by order of Jehovah. The first act of this Mighty One was to oust from heaven Satan, the invisible ruler of Babylon his organization. The time had come for God’s true people to go up to his organization, called “Jerusalem”, and vigorously engage in the work of the Lord which relates to the upbuilding of the temple of God, and to do this in obedience to his commandments. Through his prophet God had said: “Gather yourselves unto me, ye my men of lovingkindness, who have solemnized my covenant over sacrifice.”— Ps. 50: 5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Modern Samaritans, who are imitation Christians of so-called “Christendom”, claimed that they would set up their own house of God by their own scheme, and their opposition to the true children of God became so great throughout the earth that the activities of God’s workmen ceased until well near the end of 1919. As Elijah had fled because of fear, even so within the period of time just mentioned much fear was shown on the part of the people of the Lord because of the oppression and persecution by the modern Samaritans. As the spirit of God moved Haggai to prophesy and to encourage the resumption of the work on the temple, even so the spirit of the Lord God came upon his people whom we call collectively the “Society”, or his visible organization on earth, and at the Cedar Point convention in 1919 the attention of the faithful was directed to the fact that the Scriptures showed that the Elijah work had ended and that the work foreshadowed by Elisha must now be done by the faithful members of God’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> These faithful ones were then called upon to proceed at once with the work and not to fear the wrath of Satan’s representatives, but to proceed with boldness in the Lord and at all cost to do the work. But even then the work did not take on a real zeal and activity. Many consecrated showed a lack of interest in the work to be done, and continued to dream oi' things they had enjoyed in the past and what might still be their portion in the future. It was not until the eighth day of September, 1922, that the Lord stirred up the more zealous ones like unto Haggai. and then the Society called attention to the temple of the Lord and there went forth the slogan: “Advertise the King and the Kingdom.” From that time dates the real activity amongst the Lord’s people who are of the temple class and the work went steadily forward. These things help now to understand the prophecy and to apply the lesson that is taught thereby.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY ADDRESSED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> It becomes important to determine to whom the message brought by the Prophet Haggai was addressed, both primarily and antitypieally. Primarily the message of the Lord was sent unto Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor (otherwise called captain, margin) of Judah; and to Joshua, son of Jose-dech, the high priest. The message was also to the remnant of the people of Israel. Since the record so accurately identifies the recipients of the message, we may be sure that this is important and that the names and meaning thereof will now enable the anointed to have a better understanding of the prophecy; hence some attention is here given to the names and the meaning, in order to determine more clearly to whom the prophecy relates in its final application.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel, and the genealogy shows that Shealtiel was reckoned as the grandson of King Jehoiaehin through the latter’s daughter; and thus Zerubbabel’s title to Judah’s throne is shown. He was in reality a descendant of the male line proceeding from Nathan. Matthew’s gospel (Matt. 1:12-16) shows that Shealtiel (there called Salathiel) begot Zerubbabel and was the ancestor of Joseph the husband of the virgin Mary and foster father of the human Jesus. Luke’s gospel shows that Jesus was actually a descendant of Zerubbabel through the daughter of Heli, that is to say, the virgin Mary. The title of Zerubbabel to the throne of Israel is therefore clearly established. Jesus is the One “whose right it is” to the kingdom and who is the world’s true and rightful King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup>As Jehovah’s chief Officer and Agent, Jesus is the builder of the temple of God, that is to say, the antitypical temple, the one not made with hands. It is therefore apparent that Jesus should be a descendant of Zerubbabel, who built the typical temple at Jerusalem, and that therefore Zerubbabel foreshadowed or was a type of Jesus Christ. Zerubbabel being a direct descendant of Israel’s anointed king through the approved line of Nathan, and being also an ancestor of Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King, he, Zerubbabel, was properly, and fittingly used to foreshadow the anointed class, to wit, Christ Jesus and the members of his body. All of the anointed are counted in as a part of Christ Jesus, and this prophecy especially mentions the remnant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The various authorities assume that the name Zerubbabel is a compounded word and that the word “babel” is compounded into the name. Babel and Babylon properly apply to the Devil’s organization and the name Zerub-babel means the attitude or action against the Devil’s organization. Jehovah speaks of Zerubbabel as ‘my servant, whom I have chosen’. (Hag. 2:23) His identification and name therefore well represent Zerubbabel as an uncompromising foe of Satan’s organization. One of the authorities interprets the name Zerubbabel as “stranger or banished at Babylon”. Such description exactly fits the present-day remnant class, because these are strangers to and banished at Babylon, which is the Devil’s organization. Another author says that the name has the meaning “to flow away”. The remnant class did “flow away” from Babylon, or the Devil’s organization, and came to God’s organization; and therefore that description well fits. The name also, according to another author, has the meaning of “scatterer of Babylon”. And still another: “The grief of Babylon.” Surely the anointed of God is both the grief and the scatterer of the Devil’s organization. All these meanings therefore well fit God’s faithful and true people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Jehovah, by his prophet, declares that Babylon is a great destroying mountain or wicked organization which he will roll down and destroy and that ‘ ‘ before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain”. (Jer. 51: 25; Zech. 4:7) Zerubbabel was the captain, governor, or leader, of Judah, meaning ‘the leader of praise to Jehovah’s name’. Christ Jesus is the Leader of the class that renders praise to Jehovah, and God’s remnant class now leads in the company that gives praise to Jehovah God, and hence the name Judah properly applies to such.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The message from God carried by Haggai was jointly delivered to Zerubbabel, the governor, and to Joshua, the high priest of Israel. Joshua’s name means the same as “Jesus”, and he is therefore a type of Jesus. Since the remnant constitute a part of The Christ, the message antitypically is addressed to this anointed company also. The name Josedech, the father of Joshua, means “Jehovah is just, or righteous”, and would signify that the judgment ot Jehovah has begun and is progressing and is righteous and true, and would therefore suggest that the prophecy applies about this time, when the Lord has appeared at his temple for judgment. That the words of the prophecy were addressed to the “high priest” foretells that it is the royal priesthood that is addressed, the remnant of which is yet on earth and serving Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dreamers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Haggai begins his prophecy with these words: “Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord’s house should be built.” (Hag. 1:2) These words are spoken to all the consecrated people of God on earth. From 1916 on for several years, associated with those who go to make up God’s children there were many consecrated people who are now asleep as to the times and seasons and have therefore been doing no work to the glory of God. Such are described as ‘ old men, who dream dreams’. Continuing in this indifferent attitude they formed into the class that says, “My lord de-layeth his coming.” These fall into the snare about which Jesus gave warning, to wit: “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:34-36) Those who fail to heed this warning did not understand but fell away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah had used Cyrus to send the Jews back to Jerusalem, otherwise called Zion, the site of the typical temple, and the reconstruction of the temple became the most important work of their lives. Even so with the conclusion of the work of the Master in ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’, the temple activity is the next order and of the utmost importance. Suddenly or straightway Christ Jesus the great Messenger came to the temple, in 1918. Concerning the consecrated people of God at this time, it was written: “Ye are come unto mount Sion, . , . the heavenly Jerusalem.” (Heb. 12:22) Fear of the forces or powers of Satan’s organization deterred the Jews from their proper work of rebuilding the temple and led them to say: “The time is not yet come that the Lord’s house should be built.” The Jews were then enjoying God’s favor in the land of their nativity, and doing so selfishly and without proper regard to God’s interest or the glory of his name. Because of their negligence, indifference and selfishness, they ‘knew not the time of their visitation’ and they permitted opposition to stop their work.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Even so it has been with many of those who have made a covenant to do the will of God. Fear of Satan’s organization has caused many of such to become inactive. Such course of action was induced by selfishness. Where there is unselfishness there is no fear. The desire of self-preservation, ease and comfort, and the selfish desire for honor amongst men, made such cool ones easy objects of Satan’s attack, and so they soon said in substance as did the Jews: ‘The Lord delayeth his coming and therefore it is not time that the Lord’s house should be built.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Consider now the well known facts that came to pass from 1917 to 1918 and put these facts along beside the prophecy and see how well they fit when the falling away began to be made manifest and progressed rapidly from that time forward. The faultfinders and complainers and slanderers of their brethren were overreached by Satan and entangled in the affairs of this world and quickly fell into the snare of the enemy about which Jesus had warned.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANOTHER CLASS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Jesus foretold of a faithful class that would be found by him when he would appear. It is to those from whom the faithful ones come forth that the prophet now addresses his words, and this the Lord uses to challenge the false prophecy spoken by the dreamers and fault-finders. Those who are of humble and teachable mind heard the rebuke from the Lord’s prophet and learned therefrom. Hence it is recorded: “Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying, Is it time for you, 0 ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste?” (Vss. 3,4) A proper paraphrasing of the words of the prophet addressed to the teachable may be this: ‘You have received the truth and you now enjoy your deliverance from Babylon, the Devil’s organization, and is it consistent for you to receive these good things from Jehovah and neglect to do the work he has given into your hands to do?’ These words of rebuke aroused the faithful to their privileges and to a performance of their duties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Shortly after the Jews returned from Babylon to Jerusalem the altar of the Lord was set up on its base and the opportunity to offer sacrifice was therefore afforded. And then the foundation of the temple was laid. Due to the interference of their enemies the Jews had ceased from their work upon the house of the Lord. Their proper worship of Jehovah was therefore thus hindered and they were not manifesting the ‘zeal of the house of the Lord’ as was their duty. (Ps. 69: 9) Likewise in the spring of 1919 the Lord’s people were doing little if anything to the glory of God. The zeal of the Lord’s house was not being manifested. Firmly but gently the Lord said to the consecrated, in substance: ‘ Is it consistent for you to enjoy the good things you have received and at the same time neglect the work that I have given into your hands to do?’ This rebuke made the true ones think that it was time for them to awake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Then the prophet, further speaking in the name of Jehovah, said to those who thus heed: “Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your ways.” This was a plain admonition for the Lord’s people to examine themselves and their relationship to God by reason of the covenant. In harmony with this the apostle wrote to the people of God: ‘ ‘ Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2 Cor. 13:5) “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.” (1 Cor. 11:31) Some of the true people of God did begin a self-examination and that examination resulted to their good and to the glory of God’s name, while at the same time others continued in their indifferent attitude. Those who examined themselves and profited by the examination awoke to their duties and became active.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The Jews who returned from Babylon to Jerusalem did not reason from effect to cause and thus see that they were not having the rich blessings of the Lord they should expect even though they were again in the land of promise. Had they been doing their full duty God would have showered upon them his blessings according to his promise. To further awaken them to their situation the Lord through his prophet Haggai said: “Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. ’ ’ —Hag. 1:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> It was even so with many of the consecrated for some time after 1918. The storms of war and persecution had been passed and many said in substance: ‘Now we have true riches, in this, that we have the truth and know what God has in store for the people, and we need nothing more. We have done much work in the past and we have drunk deep of the waters of truth. Now we are clothed with the favors of God and we have earned our wages. We will wait until we are taken home.’ But the Lord, however, says of such: ‘ Even though this is true, you have brought in very little. You have not enough to eat, and you are not filled with drink, and while you think you are clothed you are not warm and comfortable, and what you think you have earned you have put into a bag with holes and dven that is quickly gotten away from you.’ This is another proof that no one can remain in the truth unless he busies himself in performing his covenant.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> Then God through his prophet further urges upon all such an examination and says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your ways.” (Vs. 7) The time of judgment had come and the great Judge says to those who still remain inactive: “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.” (Rev. 3:17-19) Thus is shown that the prophecy of Haggai particularly applies to the antitypical or spiritual Israelites on earth corresponding with the time of the Laodicean congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Accompanying his rebuke to the Jews the prophet of God said: “Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.”—Vss. 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> These words were uttered, be it noted, in the time of harvest of the olives of the lowlands and at the time dates and figs and grapes were ripe and hence a seasonable time for the people to give consideration to their actual conditions and the blessings they enjoyed, and how these related to the performance of their duty unto God. They had not received the abundant blessings of the Lord because they had been negligent of the most important thing they were brought back to do, to wit, the building of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Even so the Lord’s consecrated people for a time from and after 1918. They had not then learned to appreciate what it means to love. It was after that date that the consecrated came to a realization that love is not sentimentality nor “character growth”, but that it is an unselfish devotion to Jehovah God, which means the unselfish performance of the covenant in looking well to the interests of God’s cause and his people, out of which people the house of the Lord is built. Salvation through death and getting into heaven is not the most important thing, by any means. That which is of paramount importance is the building of Jehovah’s royal house by the use of which he will vindicate his glorious name. It is for this very purpose that he takes out from amongst men a people for his name; and when these come to a realization that their chief duty is to glorify God then they are beginning to see their covenant in a proper way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMMAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> The Lord then having administered- a rebuke to the Jews through his prophet gave to them a positive command, saying:“ Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord.” (Vs. 8) God’s anointed now looking back can see the correspondency between the prophecy as then spoken and as applied at the present time. The Lord sent his angels and directed his people and gave them a positive order to move into action. It was in 1922, when a company of the consecrated were assembled at the Cedar Point convention, that they came to an appreciation of Jehovah’s commandment that they were to go up and do service in the house of the Lord, even as he had commanded the Jews in rebuilding the temple at Jerusalem. God commanded the Jews to go up to Mount Lebanon, where grew the great cedars, and bring down, not fire wood, but sturdy logs and beams and joists to rebuild the house of the Lord.—1 Ki. 7:1-3,13; 2 Chron. 2:8-11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Even so the commandment of the Lord to his people about 1922 was to go and do the work laid out for them to do concerning the King and the kingdom. They must then go forward and proclaim the name of Jehovah and his mighty works and say to each other: ‘Our God reigneth. The kingdom is here. Busy yourself to make these truths known.’ No other kind of work could then be properly or really done by the consecrated that would glorify the name of the Lord. It is the temple class that go up to do the work as commanded and that speak of the glory of Jehovah God, and all in the temple thus do.—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Now call to mind how the faithful elders of tho various classes, and other humble souls, earnest men and women who loved God, responded to the trumpet call that sounded in September, 1922. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Light,</span><span class="font5"> Book One, p. 105) From that time forward those in the covenant for the kingdom zealously and joyfully went to the work. Zerubbabel and Joshua foreshadowed these because they are part of the royal priesthood led by Christ Jesus the glorified Head thereof. Christ Jesus was now leading his people forward in the work. In harmony with this the prophecy of Haggai is: “Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the Lord.”—Vs. 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> There was a godly fear that took hold upon the remnant people of God from that time on and they were and are fired by a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. These faithful ones did not resent the message of the “Lord’s messenger”, nor say as some of the unfaithful continue to say: ‘Oh, it’s merely one man’s opinion, and so we do not need to take it seriously. We will use our own best judgment and do what we think best. ’ Contrary to this stubborn disposition thus manifested the faithful responded with joy of heart and have continued to respond and to do the work which the Lord has given his people to do. It is therefore encouraging now to see how the Lord long ago foreknew and foreshadowed this class in the church, and particularly how he showed that there would be some called the “remnant” who would faithfully, earnestly and zealously continue to do his work to the end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> The Lord is pleased with the zeal of his own, and this is indicated by the words that he spoke through Haggai for the encouragement of the Jews at the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. “Then spake Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, in the Lord’s message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord.”—Vs. 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>86</sup> From 1922 forward the anointed realized that they were acting under command from the Lord; and they thus acting, the work has gone speedily forward from then tilt now to the glory of Jehovah. The angel or messenger of the Lord has spoken unto the congregations described as Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodieea. Those messengers to the truth have not been one man’s opinion, nor any part of it a man’s message. The messengers have been from Jehovah God and have set the remnant class of God right on their feet and opened their eyes that they might see where they now are and what they are to do. To those who are fearlessly and faithfully doing the work as commanded, Jehovah God now says, “I am with you,” even as he said to the Israelites; therefore, ‘ ‘ If God be for us, who can be against us?” Those of the remnant know that they are right and that they are on the Lord’s side, and they are determined to go forward regardless of all opposition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>87</sup> During the Elijah period of the work of the church a few had been prominent in the work of the Lord. The time must come when God’s prophecy uttered by Joel would be completely fulfilled, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh [all the remnant] . . . And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.” (Joel 2:28,29) The fulfilment of this prophecy in completion is particularly seen from 1922 forward. Jehovah foretold the stirring up of his people with a fiery zeal to do his work when he caused his prophet Haggai to write: “And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.”—Vs. 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Can any one of God’s remnant people today have any doubt as to the fact that Jehovah is dealing with his people as he promised and is leading them in the way that they should go ? It is now clearly to be seen that the work the zealous ones have been doing in the past few years has been exactly in harmony with God’s will and true to his prophetic commandments, and this should be a great encouragement to the remnant. Instead of listening to the slanderous statements of the enemy, the faithful will turn a deaf ear thereto, and march forward, continuing the work to the end. The Lord directed Haggai his servant and messenger to say to the Jews, “I am with you”; and since 1922 God’s people who have really devoted their all to him can appreciate the fact that Jehovah has said and still says to them, “lam with you. ’ ’ The obedient and faithful ones fully realize the fact that “except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city [his organization on earth], the watchman waketh but in vain.” —Ps. 127:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> At the same time these deeply appreciate the fact that God permits them to be cow’orkers with him and that the way to be pleasing to the Lord is to be diligent in obeying his commandments and doing the work that he has commanded shall be done. The foresight of Jehovah God in behalf of his faithful “servant” class, and his goodness toward them, is astounding. These now look back upon it and say: ‘This is marvelous in our eyes; only the Lord could do such.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Long centuries ago Jehovah foreknew and foretold the work that the remnant has been doing within the past few years. The remnant has engaged in this work and done it because of love for God; and now after such unselfish devotion to him is manifested, Jehovah shows his remnant how they have fulfilled prophecy which he caused to be written centuries ago. Surely this is for the purpose of aiding, comforting and encouraging those who love him. The Lord furnishes every means necessary to preserve those who do love him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Now Satan and his instruments are on the alert to discourage those who are doing the work of the Lord. Some who once had the blessed privilege of knowing the Lord but who were selfish became negligent and turned away from him and his cause and now claim to be God’s own and by “the use of fair words and good-sounding speech they deceive the hearts of the simple” and induce them to become negligent and fall away. Those who are doubtful, and therefore unwise, will continue to be deceived by the “evil servant” class.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Concerning the work now being done by the remnant in advertising the King arid his kingdom, and giving testimony to the name of Jehovah God, those of the “evil servant” class now say: ‘You are only advertising a commercial business of selling books; behold, how good we are, and we show love for all and are preparing ourselves for the heavenly home.’ Such is fair speech, but it is deceptive speech. It is speech used subtly, and is contrary to God’s commandments, and it deceives only those who are weak. The Lord foreknew and foretold this condition now on earth amongst those who claim to worship him, and caused the prophecy to be written for the very purpose of aiding his faithful ones. Therefore let all those who love God take courage now and slack not the hand but go zealously on in obedience to the Lord’s commandments and do the work. Thus did God command the people of Judah, and thus he commands those now who sing praises to his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Due to the encouraging message God sent to the Jews through Haggai, the work was organized quickly and proceeded with due diligence. Even so now, due to the encouraging message the Lord has sent and sends to his people through his Word, and by his angels, to the remnant, these must now move forward joyfully in the organization and the work and carry it on diligently and to the glory of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">** For some time the remnant have seen that there is a great work yet to be done by those who love Jehovah ; and although this work is fraught with much danger by reason of the activity of the enemy, it shall be done and carried to a successful end, because Jehovah has commanded it and because he says that he is with those who are faithful and who continue to do the work according to his commandments. The blessings that the Lord has showered upon his faithful workers during the year past is conclusive evidence of this. It is not for the remnant to say when they shall slack the work or sit down and be at ease. God through his prophet clearly indicates that this work must go on. In response to a question propounded by the Prophet Isaiah, representing God’s remnant, to wit, “Lord, how long?” the answer is given by the Lord: “Until the cities [organizations of the enemy] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away.”—Isa. 6:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> There are many corroborative scriptures showing that some of the faithful remnant will still continue to be used of the Lord in doing his work in connection with the temple and doing it right here on earth until Armageddon is fought. Some have foolishly taken the position that a portion of the remnant would be on earth during the entire thousand-year reign of Christ. There is no warrant for this in the Scriptures. In fact, such a conclusion is entirely out of harmony with the Scriptures. It seems clear, however, that for the sake of the elect Armageddon will be quick and sharp and immediately following it some of the remnant, before they are taken away, will be used to instruct the people. How long that will be it is impossible to say, but it seems it would be a brief time. Let each one of the remnant now do with his might what he finds to do, and do it to the glory of God. As the temple building progressed in the days of Zerubbabel, so the work in connection with the antitypical temple now progresses.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>JEHOVAH’S GLORY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">N THE prophecy of Habakkuk 2:14 it is written: “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” That prophecy is certain to have a complete fulfilment. For more than sixty centuries the peoples of earth have been kept in ignorance of the glory of Jehovah God, and Satan has been the chief one who has thus hindered them from obtaining knowledge. Satan uses his agents in general, and his religious agents in particular, to blind the people to the truth. The day of hypocrisy must end, because God has declared that his truth shall sweep away the refuge or hiding place of lies and that all shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth. It is a happy privilege now to announce that already the tide of truth, giving a knowledge of God’s glory, is beginning to rise, and no power can prevent its continuing to rise until all shall know the Lord from the least to the greatest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who in this day devote themselves earnestly to the study of God’s Word are blessed with an advance vision of the glory of God and the blessings he will bring to the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never in the history of man has there been a time so favorable for the study of God’s Word of truth as now. Jehovah God, by and through the words of his prophet, and the bringing to pass of physical facts in fulfilment thereof, has revealed his purpose to man, and it is written for man: ‘Blessed is the man who reads and understands.’ My sincere desire is to see the people of earth blessed, and therefore I delight to call attention to the goodness of Jehovah. He is the King of glory, and from him proceeds everything that is good for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah speaks of the earth as his footstool. His promise is to ‘make the place of his feet glorious’, meaning that the earth and the peoples of the earth shall be brought to a knowledge of his glory. He is the just and righteous One, and every act of his is prompted by love, which means complete unselfishness. When man comes to a knowledge of the unselfishness of the Almighty God, then he will begin to discern something of his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has expressed his purpose to have an ‘elect servant’ to administer his blessings and to be his chief instrument to carry out his purposes. The glory of this “servant” is received from Jehovah. None other is given such glory, and this honor and glory is particularly emphasized in the privilege of proclaiming the majesty, the loving-kindness, and the goodness of Jehovah God. The elect servant is composed of Christ Jesus and 144,000 others of like faithfulness. Included in this class is John, the faithful follower of Christ Jesus, who because of his fidelity was, in his old age, banished to the isle of Patmos, and there was privileged to write the book of Revelation. God’s time has come and he has been pleased to make clear the meaning of this Revelation to those who love and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is stated in the divine record that God gave this revelation to Jesus Christ and directed him in due time to point out to his “servant” class on the earth the meaning thereof and what must quickly come to pass. The fact that the Revelation is now made known to the servants of God is therefore strong proof that the great change from the unrighteous rule of the world to the righteous government is just at hand. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">knowledge of these facts is essential to the people that they may know there is hope for their early relief and for their boundless blessings. All order-loving people should put forth their best endeavors to acquire such knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today the peoples of every nation are in distress and suffering. The clergy now frequently remind the people that their suffering is due to the fact that they have not been faithful to their church and that God is punishing them for their wrong in neglecting their church duties. That claim of the clergy is false and hypocritical in the extreme. Others say that the great amount of distress and suffering amongst the people, which has covered a period of centuries, was permitted by the Lord in order to teach the people lessons needful for their welfare. Reasoning from that viewpoint many see that the wickedness of the world, if permitted for that reason, has been and is carried on by and with the consent and connivance of Jehovah. Thus believing, many are turned away from God and say, in substance: ‘We want nothing to do with a God that causes us to suffer so much.’ That reason is also false. The suffering of humankind is not by the consent or connivance of Jehovah to teach mankind lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">knowledge of the true reason is essential and reflects the glory of God. Centuries ago Satan started the operation of wickedness, caused man to violate God’s law, and all the human race to come under suffering and death. Satan knew that God had created the earth for man and man for the earth and had announced his purpose to people the earth with a perfect and happy race. He knew that such perfect and happy people would forever worship God and give glory to his name. Satan coveted that very thing for himself; and ambitious for this worship, he caused man to sin in order to turn him away from Jehovah God. In substance, Satan said to Jehovah: ‘You cannot put a man on the earth who will maintain his integrity and be always obedient to your law.’ That immediately put at issue God’s words and his great name. That issue could only be for ever and completely settled and settled right by permitting Satan to do his worst and then, when he has reached a climax in his wickedness, for God to reveal his own almighty power, justice, and wisdom, and to disclose this and his loving-kindness to his creation. A knowledge thereof proves the truthfulness of God’s Word and gives glory to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gave his word that he would raise up a “seed” which in due time would destroy the wicked one and his works; that he would first send a redeemer for man and that then he would appoint a mighty ruler of the earth who should set up a government of righteousness, destroy wickedness, and bring complete relief to the people; that under that righteous government millions of men would be restored to life, who would learn the truth and maintain their integrity to God, and thus prove the truthfulness of his word and the honor of his name. Jehovah, having given his word, said: ‘My word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. I have purposed it, it will also come to pass. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not experience with evil that teaches men to do right, but it is a knowledge of the truth and which knowledge discloses God’s justice and loving-kindness, that leads men in the right way. Jehovah has furnished an abundance of proof in his Word from which men can gain the needed knowledge, and now the time has come for the people to begin to acquire that knowledge. Within a short time Satan’s powerful organization, which now causes the terrible suffering of humanity, will be completely destroyed. It is this new and righteous government under the Messiah which will bring the people complete relief. Concerning such government Jehovah gave his word that it shall rest upon the shoulder of the mighty Lord, Christ Jesus, and that his government will bring everlasting peace, blessings and life to the human family. That will completely vindicate God’s word and his name and show forth his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John, who wrote down the Revelation, represented and stood for all of those faithful followers of Christ Jesus who would be on the earth at the end of the world, where we now are. God’s promise is that these shall have an understanding of the vision which he gave John when upon the isle of Patmos. Furthermore, that when these do receive such understanding they must make the fact thereof known to others who might desire to know what is about to come to pass. These faithful witnesses of the Lord now discern the fact that Jehovah God’s name and word are the great things involved. The complete vindication of his word and name is now just at hand. Therefore the prophet has put in the mouth of such these words: “0 Lord, our God, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.” (Ps. 8:1,2) His witnesses are compared to babes but they must and will tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the twenty-first chapter of Revelation John wrote down this vision: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. ’ ’ The fulfilment of that prophetic vision follows the great battle of Armageddon soon to be fought. With the fire of that terrible trouble burned out, the righteous government of Messiah will appear to all and then the earth shall be filled with a knowledge of the glory of God. Then the people will for ever put out of mind the wickedness of Satan’s rule and the suffering that they endured under that old world. Then they will give unstinted praise to Jehovah’s name. Jehovah in his word of promise says: “Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”—Isa. 65:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John had a vision of the fulfilment of that word of promise, and now it is seen that this prophetic vision is shortly to be completely fulfilled. The word “heaven” used in this text means “the kingdom of heaven”, or God’s righteous government having its seat of authority in heaven, under Christ. It is the invisible part of God’s great organization. The “new earth” means the peoples of the earth organized and carrying on affairs in righteousness under the guiding hand of the righteous ruler, the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the text says “there shall be no more sea”. That does not mean that the oceans will be dried up. Remember that the book of Revelation is written in symbols. The “sea” symbolically represents the peoples of earth that are alienated from God, that fell under the influence and power of Satan, and that give birth to and bear up the wicked system of rule that oppresses mankind. It is from that sea that Satan has brought forth the visible part of his organization, symbolized by a wild beast. It means the beastly governing or ruling powers that have oppressed mankind. At Armageddon Satan and the beast and his entire organization will go down. Then Christ will begin the restoration of all obedient ones of mankind. Those who refuse to obey and who continue in wickedness will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the work of reconciliation is done there will be no more godless people, or people alienated from God, and therefore there will be “no more sea”, as this scripture says. That restored and happy people will reflect the glory of God. The invisible ruling power, Christ, is the new heaven; and the peoples of earth, reconciled to God and obedient to him and to Christ, will constitute the new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore it is written: “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (Vs. 2) “The holy city” is the heavenly organization completely separated from the wicked one and his organization, and every whit thereof dedicated to the Holy One, Jehovah; and therefore it is holy. Out of all the cities in the earth only one city was designated by Jehovah as “the holy city”, and that was Jerusalem. It was typical. And so in the antitype there is but one city or organization which forms a part of Jehovah’s greater organization and is the “holy city”.—Neh. 11:1,19 ; Isa. 52:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “new Jerusalem” means “the possession [foundation] of peace, the secure habitation”. It has no reference to the earthly city of Jerusalem, either ancient or modem. It is the new organization composed of new creatures in Christ and called the “new creation” of God. It does not include the “great multitude”, or ‘tribulation class’; and this is indicated by the text. Only the overcomers have its name written on them.—Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, which excludes all who are not members of the body of Christ. It has twelve gates bearing the names of the twelve tribes, showing that only “the servant of God” is admitted to its membership. It is organized in heaven, the abode of Jehovah, and it is therefore the holy city or organization ‘which hath foundations, whose builder is God’. (Heb. 11:10,16) It is “cut out of [his] mountain [meaning God’s universal organization] without hands [of men] ’ ’, and it comes down from heaven and rules the earth.—Dan. 2:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning those who represent that city it is said: “For our conversation [citizenship, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font5"> is in heaven; from whence also wc look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Phil. 3:20) This is further proof that none will be of that holy city as citizens or parts thereof except the members of the body of Christ. It is a beautiful city and is adorned for her glorious husband, Christ, the Head of that city. (Isa. 61:10) “As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.” (Isa. 62:5) “So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.” (Ps. 45:11) In it is “the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness; . . . the voice of the bride; the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts; for the Lord is good; for his mercy endurcth for ever”.—Jer. 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are millions of persons on earth today who claim to be Christian but who, because they have no knowledge of God, his goodness and his glory, do not appreciate the marvelous times in which wc arc now living. There is also a small number, comparatively speaking, on earth who are wholly devoted to God and his righteous cause, and these are spoken of in the Scriptures as the remnant of his people. It is to this class called the “remnant” the Lord has committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and has commanded such to go and give this testimony before the people. These hear the voice or commandment of the Lord out of heaven, because they see in his Word his purpose and what is his will concerning those who love him. The Revelation then continues a description of God’s organization:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” (Vs. 3) This verse applies specifically to God’s remnant now on the earth. John heard the voice, which denotes that the remnant first hears this message from the throne and then transmits it to the people. “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. ’ ’—Mic. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is strong evidence that some of the remnant will be on the earth after Armageddon and will be the ones used by the Lord to first inform the people who have survived the time of trouble. The message from the throne is, “The tabernacle of God is with men,” and suggests that the remnant of God, the sanctuary class at that time, is still on the earth in a lowly, transient condition. This reference is to “the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man”, and is not one built by human hands.—Heb. 8:2; 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus came to his temple in 1918 and began judgment with the house of God. The evidence is strong that the outpouring of the holy spirit according to the prophecy took place in 1922. (Acts 2:18; Joel 2: 28,29) In the type the tabernacle in the wilderness was anointed at its dedication and inauguration unto God’s service. (Ex. 40:1-11) “The true tabernacle” is with the remnant, and from and after the[r anointing to the service of God. It is to be expected that God’s anointed people would from that time forward carry out the commands to give a wide testimony of God and of his kingdom. (Isa. 43:10,12; Matt. 24:14) The facts show that the work has been progressing, and particularly since 1922. At the same time the Devil is making conditions on earth as miserable as possible. (Rev. 12:12) The tabernacle denotes the presence of God with men in the representative capacity of his sanctuary class. There would necessarily be warfare between the sanctuary class and Satan from that time forward until Satan is put down completely following Armageddon. Then will follow the ministration to the people by those who represent God. First the remnant hear the voice from heaven and they lift up God’s standard to the people. Then those faithful men who shall be “princes in all the earth” shall represent the kingdom and teach the people.—Ps. 45:16; Heb. 11: 39,40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the kingdom has begun, surely the Lord will have on earth some representative from henceforth and forever. If so, then the faithful princes, who shall represent the Lord on earth, must return before all the remnant class has passed from the earth. The earth must be a “holy place” from the time God’s representatives take possession, even though the enemy continues to defile it until he and his organization are destroyed. John is then shown that God, ruling through his representatives, shall bring blessings to mankind and that he will be the God of all who obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.” (Vs. 4) Christ will be the hand that God will use to wipe away all tears. (1 Cor. 15:25,26; Hos. 13:14) For many centuries the people have suffered oppression, pain, .injury, sickness, loss of health and of life. Gradually these things shall be made to pass away and there will be no more slavery, drudgery, or cruel oppression, and finally there will be no sickness and no death. The final result of the reign of Christ will be the destruction of every enemy of man, including death. All this shall be to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write; for these words are true and faithful.” (Vs. 5) Manifestly this represents Jehovah speaking to John and to the John class. (Rev. 4:2; 5:1) It is God who will reconcile the people to himself; and “all things are of God” and by Christ his “right hand”. (2 Cor. 5:17,18; Eph. 4:2-6) There shall be an entirely new world. “For, behold, I [Jehovah] create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.”—Isa. 65:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the remnant Jehovah gives anew the wine of good cheer and joy. (Matt. 26: 29) He establishes the New Jerusalem. (Rev. 3:12) He establishes the new covenant w'ith the true Israelites. (Heb. 8: 8-13) Then he gives a new heart to the people who love and obey him and everything is made to the good of creation and to the glory of God. (Ezek. 36:26; 11:19) This is what John heard and what the remnant then discern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John not only had this glorious vision of things that must shortly come to pass, but was commanded to write them. Now the remnant, whom John represented, seeing these things coming to pass, to them Jehovah now says: “New things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.” (Isa. 42: 9) It follows, therefore, that the remnant is not shown these things merely for the pleasure of the remnant, but that as witnesses for Jehovah they might tell them out to others. That witness to the name of Jehovah must continue until the 'princes of the earth’ return. The testimony or word of God is “true and faithful”, is reliable and trustworthy and sure of accomplishment. Blessed is the class now having a part in telling that message of truth to the people and to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The holy city or holy Jerusalem is a symbolic name given to the organization of Jehovah which is righteous and pure and reflects his personal glory. God’s faithful witnesses now on earth and who like John are ostracized see in his Word Jehovah’s glorious organization and what is about to come to pass and they are commanded to go and tell the people about it. This knowledge is given unto them by the grace of God, and given for the aid and comfort of those in this hour of stress who desire to see righteousness and peace established amongst the people. John continues to describe that glorious organization of Jehovah in these words: “And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven, from God, having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.”—Rev. 21:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The universal organization of Jehovah is mentioned under the name “Jerusalem which is above . . . [and] which is the mother” of those who are born in Christ. (Gal. 4:26) It is “the city of the living God”. (Heb. 12:22) It is also designated Zion. Jehovah is the husband of his universal organization, pictured by his “mount Zion”, which gives birth to the kingdom of which Christ is the Head and Chief. The hundred and forty-four thousand and One, composing the Christ, or kingdom, take the name (and are especially designated by the name) of God’s universal organization. These bear the name of the Father and the mother. “I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God.” (Rev. 3:12) The New Jerusalem in Revelation is restricted to the 144,000, who arc espoused to one husband, Christ, and who take the name of Jehovah and of his organization. The “New Jerusalem”, or “holy Jerusalem”, is specifically the organization of Christ over which he is the Head, and it is “the Lamb’s wife”. It is also a part of Jehovah’s universal organization. The ones composing this organization are wholly and completely devoted to Jehovah. As the city of Jerusalem in Palestine was the capital city of God’s typical people, so the “holy Jerusalem”, or “New Jerusalem”, is the capital or chief part of God’s true and universal organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah begins the fulfilment of this prophecy when he builds up Zion upon the coming of the Lord to his temple, and therefore it is in course of fulfilment upon the anointed remnant, and to such he says: ‘‘In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people.”—Isa. 28: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To those who are of the remnant and continuing faithful he says: ‘‘Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.”—Isa. 60:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The God of all grace . . . hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.”—1 Pet. 5:10; Eph. 1:12; 3:21; Rom. 2:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This glorious organization is shown descending out of heaven; which is proof that it is God’s organization created for his beloved Son. Her light or luminary is Jehovah and is likened unto a white diamond, the most precious of all stones. It is therefore pictured as a light most rare and precious. It is the organization or city of light, and God has declared that he will not hold his peace “until the righteousness thereof [shall] go forth as brightness”.—Isa. 62:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Revelator, after describing in symbolic phrase the glory of God, then delivers a message in his name notifying the peoples to come and learn of his glory and of the blessings that shall flow to those who receive such knowledge. In Revelation 22:17 it is written: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) This is a gracious invitation. Jehovah speaks to those who have agreed to do his will and says to them: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God,” and these must deliver this invitation to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the great Spirit. Christ Jesus is his express image, and the faithful body members of Christ constitute the bride. Therefore the Lord speaks through his witnesses and says to the people: ‘Let all people who sincerely desire to know the truth come and take thereof freely, ’ because to know God and his Christ means to learn the way to everlasting life. This message is now being given to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking through his prophet Isaiah to his ‘elect servant’ God now says, ‘I have given you for a witness to the people, and leader and commander to the people.’ (Isa. 55:4) This does not mean a leader in politics; but it means to take the lead in pointing out to the people the truth, that they may gain a knowledge of the goodness and glory of God. For this reason the faithful witnesses of the Lord now must go to the people and give them the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although this testimony of truth exposes the hypocrisy of the clergy and the cruel and oppressive hand of their allied rulers, the purpose is not to do injury to any, but is given in order that the people may see and understand the truth and know how their relief shall come. It is the means employed by the Lord to sweep away the hiding place of falsehoods that the light of truth may shine into the minds of men. The giving of this testimony means the beginning of the fulfilment of God’s prophecy to fill the earth with a knowledge of his glory. The giving of such testimony, to be sure, meets with strong opposition from Satan and his agencies; but it must be and will be given, regardless of all opposition. Jehovah God will see to it that his witnesses ride triumphantly over all obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the witnesses of Jehovah continue to joyfully sing his praises. Let the people that are in distress forsake and abandon the wicked organization of Satan that has so long oppressed them and turn to Jehovah God and learn of his way and complete remedy for their relief. The peoples of earth have long sought honor, wealth, comfort and ease, and all these have failed them. Now let the people seek a knowledge and understanding of God and his gracious provision for them. Such knowledge is more precious than all the gold, and far more to be desired than all the honor that can be conferred upon man. God through his King will make the earth a fit place on which to live. He will cause the oppressed of mankind to lay down their burdens and bear away a song of praise. His goodness and loving-kindness shall enter into their minds and make them glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now let the oppressed take courage and lift up their heads. Let all who love righteousness now say to the people and nations of earth: ‘God’s kingdom is at hand; he will rule in righteousness and the world shall be established that it shall never again be moved. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The song of praise now raised to the glory of God shall continue until every creature that has breath shall join in the song of praise to the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT IS JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and greatly to be praised; and of his greatness there is no search. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. Men shall speak of the might of his terrible acts. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. Jehovah is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. Jehovah preserveth all them that love him.</span><span class="font4">—David.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LETTERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INSPIRATION TO GREATER ZEAL AND SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have just read the double volume </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> carefully, and now intend going over it again more thoroughly and studiously, looking up its various references and citations with still more care and prayerfulness for deeper mind impression. Its perusal in a cursory way should very clearly show to those falling away from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society that they are entirely wrong and are affiliated with Satan, and it should hasten their steps toward reuniting themselves with the instrument God is using to enlighten the world; namely, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which was formed of Jehovah and has been his earthly mouthpiece ever since its inauguration, and still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> and then persist in antagonizing the Society is clear evidence of being on the side of the great adversary of God and men, whether its reader is cognizant of the fact or not. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> proves conclusively and indisputably that the Society of Bible Students have the correct understanding of the Bible and are positively right in their faith and work. Careful readers of this book can now plainly see why the Lord has kept secret his Revelation until now, and in his due time has made it so plain to his faithful remnant class, and has thus afforded ample opportunity for all the outgoers to select and appoint their own course of action, that is, to exercise their free moral agency on affiliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> how can any ot the outgoers continue longer in their present course, the evidence being so clear that they are on the wrong side? There is now no excuse whatever for antagonizing the Bible Society. All right-minded ones of them must at once renounce their adherence to the faction to which they have belonged, and instead take a stand with the Lord, or prove themselves worthy of God’s righteous indignation and punishment. And every wavering one of the Society, and such as may entertain some measure of criticism respecting its work, or may to some extent have questioned its more recent interpretation of Bible truth, should feel stimulated to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">greater </span><span class="font4">zeal and confidence that God is with his human instrument, namely, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and is its guiding light. Our faith is strengthened and our confidence is made more secure. To Jehovah be all praise for this wonderful book, and thanks to the Brooklyn staff of ardent workers. This book will stimulate the colporteur corps to greater activity and incident blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his sending forth the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah leaves no excuse </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for any </span><span class="font4">Bible Student to doubt that the Society has the truth and is being used of him for the proclaiming of his message. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font4">book within itself conclusively proves that God directed its presentation, and that its human author was not employing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font4">own judgment and wisdom in its preparation. No human creature could have written </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> unless the holy spirit of God operated on his mind, actuated his thoughts and guided its utterances. It matters not whether Jehovah individually inspired the volume or had his representative Jesus do it. The evidence is there that the work is of the Lord. Brother Rutherford could not of himself have written this book. The wisdom therein is beyond human. It is divine. This double volume is priceless. It is wonderful. It should be an inspiration to the entire remnant class, prompting to still greater zeal and service, and should steady any who are wavering in faith or wondering whether the Society is right and correct in Bible interpretation and understanding. It should prompt any faltering ones to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">get </span><span class="font4">into line and herald the divine message to the peoples of earth. No other agency on earth is doing that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> carries witness in itself that its presentations have di</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">vine </span><span class="font4">origin. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">is indeed divino revelation entrusted to human for portrayal. God be praised for this gift, a satisfying portion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font4">last Revelation reveals. Brother Rutherford could not have improved on the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font4"> except by divine supervision. What </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">comfort to our dear brother this must be. I hesitate to take up his precious time with a personal letter of my deep appreciation. May the Lord continue to stiengthen him is my prayer. Not once in this book does he allude to himself either directly or indirectly, but ever accords credit to the whole Society membership, and he treats the deluded outgoers as gently and as kindly as circumstances and conditions would ndtnit of his doing in justice to Ids sacred trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If this letter seems too long, please pardon me, for “my cup runneth over’’ with gratitude. 1 heartily endorse everything set forth in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light. It is sublime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faithfully in Christ, your brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. A. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bohnet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED IN SPIRIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coworkers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the last regular business meeting, it was the unanimous desire of the ecclesia to express to you our appreciation of the wonderful truths which are coming to us through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4"> and of the many blessings and favors received from the Bible House during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We rejoice that our heavenly Father, the great Jehovah, is so richly blessing us through his appointed channel, to which we pledge our most hearty cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your radio piograms are creating great interest and doing much good toward the vindication of Jehovah’s great name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the voice from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> continue to speak louder and louder proclaiming these sweet truths to the hungry ones throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is our hearts’ desire to tell you that we feel united with you in spirit, and by this letter we want to assure you of our joy in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom of God, and are glad of the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May our heavenly Father continue to bless, strengthen, and protect you, is our prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much love to you and all the dear Bethel Family,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Flint</span><span class="font4"> (Mich.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ecclesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WONDERFUL TRUTHS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford in the Lord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After having finished reading the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font4"> which has been published in our language just recently, I really can’t express in words the wonderful material that is found in it and how good this book is for me. What there was lacking for me I found in this book. I can now see more clearly than ever what work you are doing; that the Lord is causing all these wonderful truths to be brought to the peoples’ attention through you and your colaborers, and that truly the Society is God’s organization now on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I fully realize the grave mistake some of the brethren are making by leaving the Society and following a different course of action. Am also sorry to notice that many of our Ukrainian friends have been misled by other so-called “brethren’’.— Rom. 16: 17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a long time I was downhearted and discouraged by this condition of falling away, but now I see that it’s only the ones that are zealous for the Lord’s cause that can fully see and appreciate their standing with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord bless you and all your associates. I am, By his favor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">M. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tymkiw, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S GIFT FOR OUR COMFORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can’t find words to express our thanks for the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> the most wonderful explanation of Revelation ever written. We fully accept it as a gift from God for our comfort at this seemingly most crucial time of testing of the feet members of Christ on earth. We are fully convinced that no human mind could wnte a book like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank the Lord for using you, his humble servant, to convey this meat in due season to the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We pray the heavenly Father's richest blessing on you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren in the Lord’s cause,</span></p>

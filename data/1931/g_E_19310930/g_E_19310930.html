<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Mr. Harding’s Dim Realization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N HIS eulogy of Warren G. Harding, on the occasion of the unveiling of the monument to his memory erected in Marion, Ohio, President Hoover spoke of Mr. Harding’s “dim realization that he had been betrayed”. Well, if he were to awake and read May Dixon Thacker’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Strange Death of President Harding</span><span class="font5"> he would know perfectly well all about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was bad for Warren that he had an ambitious wife that was a slave to demonism, and it was bad for him that after he was married he had the several clandestine love affairs which enabled the Ohio Gang to get him by the throat. Mr. Hoover could hardly have failed to know all about it, and for him to say that Mr. Harding had only a “dim realization” of what was going on is preposterous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was bad for Warren that he was president while Jess Smith was operating the house at 903 16th St. NW., in between his trips to Washington Court House, Ohio, to deposit the pickings of the gang. Sometimes the gang had as much as $500,000 hidden there at one time. If Warren Harding did not have more than a dim realization of what was going on in that house during his administration, then he did not know much about anything; for in that house, Miss Thacker’s book shows, the Harding administration was managed by Jess Smith and his gang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you read Miss Thacker’s book, you come to know that nobody can have any private papers of any kind in America. If a detective wants anything you have, it matters not what, he gets it, and that is all there is to it. It was because Mrs. Harding wanted all Warren’s love letters to Nan Britton that she got them all, to the last one. It is all so easy for “ropers” and “investigators” to lure people away, to make wax impressions of keyholes and to take what they want. It makes you envy the pygmies of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t fool yourself that you can hide a piece of paper the size of a postage stamp. If they want it they will find it and get it, whether you live to tell the story or not. But you can believe it or not, just as you like, when Mrs. Harding showed Warren all the letters he had written to Nan Britton, some of them wdiile he was president, he had more than a dim realization that he had been betrayed. He knew it mighty well. Mrs. Harding even knew where Nan met the president when she came to the White House. And when she told him about it his dim realization must have glowed like a volcano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Mr. Harding were to wake up and read Miss Thacker’s story of the glass bowl through which passed the $7,000,000 of prohibition graft funds, all under the management of his friend Jess Smith, and if he could read about how the Alien Property matters were handled by himself, Mr. Daugherty and Col. Miller, his dim realization would shine like the sun at noonday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for the Teapot Dome and Elk Hills matters, they have been discussed so often, and have found such a large place in the public prints, that one wonders how Warren could have been or anybody else could have thought him to be so stupid as to have had only a dim realization that he was betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He was caught with the goods; everybody was caught; but business went on as usual, and the public, the poor suckers, listen wide-eyed and open-mouthed and drink in the encomiums and look up to Warren and his friends as examples of what American youths should aspire to become. We have a dim realization that they know better, but, as Barnum said, they love to be humbugged. And they have been, and are. But sometime they will see a great light.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The Akron,” the World’s Largest Airship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TpROM our office windows, on the eighth floor ■ way, the cars being counterbalanced, of the finest printshop in the world, we</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">often see passing over New York the airships which are based at Lakehurst, N. J. They come up, sail around with infinite grace over the tallest buildings, and disappear as quietly as they come, back to their home in the pines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be hard to think of anything more beautiful than their silvery sides gleaming against the azure sky. In no time they come and are gone. Airplanes are so common we never stop to look at them, but an airship is different. It is hard to sit still when one comes in sight. Somehow’ one feels that this is the thing that is to be used in the new<sup>7</sup> age for swift travel overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Plenty of people think thus, especially around Akron, Ohio, where a three-day convention of Jehovah’s witnesses recently afforded us an opportunity to enter the world’s largest airship dock (of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation) and to see there, in process of construction, the largest airship in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So vast is the area of this dock (eight and one-half acres under roof) that sudden changes of temperature cause clouds to form inside the hangar and rain falls. The little booklet published by the Goodyear people explains that this $2,225,000 building is so large that it is useless to attempt to heat it, except in the offices and shops which it houses, and adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The orange-peel-shaped doors, weighing 600 tons each, follow the contour of the building in opening and closing and are attached to a single six-foot pin at the top and roll on 40 wheels, assembled on four-wheel trucks, riding on a circular track.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The building is 1,175 feet long, 325 feet wide, and 211 feet high, the largest structure in the world without interior support. Ten football games could be played simultaneously under its roof, six miles of standard railroad tracks could be laid on its eight and one-half acres of floor, 100,000 people could gather within its walls, the Lexington and Saratoga, the great airplane carriers, could be housed there, the Woolworth building could be laid length-wise inside and the Washington monument added alongside it and there would still be ample room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the 7,200 tons of steel in the framework expand and contract with changes in temperature, the arches of the building are placed on rollers, so that the giant building may be said literally to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several working platforms, lowered from the roof, give the workmen access to the ship; and a series of six catwalks along the under side of the curving roof make the upper reaches accessible. An inclined railcarries the workmen to their stations aloft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A helium storage plant -was built underground, alongside the dock, huge cylinders having a total capacity of more than 1,000,000 cubic feet of gas at 750 pounds pressure, being utilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At either end of the huge semi-paraboloid building are doors, each of the general shape of one-eighth of an orange peel. These doors weigh 1,200 tons to the pair. One man opens them at the rate of forty feet a minute. They swing in circular form around the end of the hangar, so that ’when fully opened the end of the building is missing altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Akron” now building will have a gas volume of 6,500,000 cubic feet, as against the Graf Zeppelin’s 3,700,000 feet. It is only 9 feet longer than the Graf, but is 133 feet in diameter, as against 100 feet in the German ship that flew around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will have eight engines, as against the Graf’s five, and will have a range without refueling of 10,500 miles, as against the Graf’s 6,125 miles. The horsepower will be 4,480, as against 2,750, and the gross lift 403,000 pounds, as against 258,000 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Akron” consists primarily of a series of huge rings connected with longitudinal girders, the whole appropriately covered. The gas, helium, is non-inflammable, and is enclosed in twenty cells or separate bags, placed between the ring girders. If several of these cells should be wrecked the ship would still be seaworthy, or airworthy, perhaps we should say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The little book tells us that Benjamin Franklin was one of the first to witness a balloon flight and that he wrote home to some of his friends what he thought might eventually come of this matter of navigation of the air. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the pleasantries that conversation produces on this subject, some suppose flying to be now invented, and that since men may be supported in the air, nothing is wanted but some light handy instrument to give and direct motion. Some think progressive motion on the earth may be advanced by it, and that a running footman or a horse slung and suspended under such a globe so as to have no more of weight pressing the earth with their feet than perhaps eight or ten pounds, might with a fair wind run in a straight line across countries as fast as that wind, and over hedges, ditches and even waters. It has been even fancied that in time people will keep such globes anchored in the air, to which by pulleys they may draw up game to be preserved in the cool and water</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">to be frozen when ice is wanted. And that to get money, it will be contrived to give people an extensive view of the country, by running them up in an elbow chair a mile high for a guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the moment this is written, all the world is agog over the achievement of Messrs. Post and Gatty in flying around the top of the -world </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> less than nine days, but the Goodyear people pin their faith to the zeppelins for travel over sea. Their spokesman says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All successful Atlantic airplane flights may fairly be discounted as having been made by overloaded planes, without pay load, by abnormally courageous pilots, and in the most favorable summer weather that could be found. The unsuccessful airplane flights give mute testimony that good luck cannot be depended on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do know, however, that the modern airplane can fly the Atlantic provided one of several things does not happen. The things that must not happen are: first, persistent head winds causing exhaustion of fuel supply at sea; second, engine failure from any cause; third, loss of visibility with consequent loss of control and course; and fourth, failure of any structural part or function of lifting, stabilizing or control surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each of these contingencies may be fatal to the airplane, and in this I include the flying boat or seaplane in the North Atlantic, as its chance of survival there on the surface of the sea is at best precarious. In low latitudes both in the Pacific and Atlantic, a flying boat has a very fair chance to remain afloat, but due to the infrequency of passing steamers many days may elapse before rescue. In general, a forced landing on the high seas cannot be tolerated by a commercial enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chance of a forced landing at sea due to exhaustion of fuel is measured by the margin of fuel carried versus the weather to be expected. We know that even with an overloaded start and no pay load and with favorable weather there has been practically no margin for those airplanes that have successfully negotiated the eastward crossing of the North Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Germany, prior to the World War, more than 35,000 passengers were carried in zeppelins over various routes. By the close of the conflict 115 zeppelins had been constructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A word more about “The Akron”. In her gas cells there will be used goldbeater’s skins from 400,000 cattle. These skins are taken from the intestines of steers because of their thinness and extraordinary strength. The engines are inside the ship. This is possible because a nonexplosive gas is used to sustain the craft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a hangar in “The Akron” for five airplanes. The planes may be released while the ship is in flight and may be picked up again by a trapeze arrangement operated by a winch. These airplanes, we conjecture, will be used to distribute Sunday school lessons in time of war. There are observation and “gun” platforms, and seventeen telephones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an interesting item regarding winds, which we think will attract attention of those who consider it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wind—The effect of wind on the airship is not entirely understood because of the comparison of its effect on anchored objects, like trees or houses, or those moving slowly, like ocean vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The airship, however, is moving with the air currents. If a ship were to fly in a 60-mile gale with all its engines shut off like a free balloon, the passengers would be conscious of no sense of motion at all. If they stuck a hand out of the window there would be no rush of air past it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The airship during such a gale is not subject to anything like the stresses tugging at a house which cannot move, or a ship at sea the response of which to the wind’s movements is impeded by the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the wind is moving in the same direction as the ship it merely increases its speed to that extent. If flying against the wind its forward speed is retarded. An 80-mile-an-hour airship bucking a 30-mile wind would be actually making only 50 m. p. h.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The airship skipper figures shrewdly to take advantage of winds and hunts for storms rather than avoids them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Job of Being a General</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">rpiIE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Guardian</span><span class="font5"> of Oklahoma puts -L forth the following which contains just enough truth to make it one of the funniest things ever printed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The occupation of general at the front is classed a first class risk by all old line life insurance companies who have figures to prove it. For every general wounded in the battles of the last war, 200,735 civilians broke their necks stepping on cakes of soap in their bathtubs and 6,800,547 other civilians received serious injuries falling out of hammocks. In fact the only way to kill a general in modern war is by hitting him in the neck with a gun that shoots around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Events in Canada </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font5">ANADA, in an effort to stay the progress of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Russia, has taken the drastic action of refusing to trade with her; and in this connection the Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font5"> says editorially:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ In refusing to carry on trade with Russia Canada is alone among trading nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States is delivering to Russia by midApril tractors and combine harvesters to a value of $45,000,000 and her manufacturers will go on making such wares for Russia. The ten-million-dollar order which Canada refused will, no doubt, be added to the bulk of the orders placed in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An amalgamation of British engineers has, according to the Ottawa </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen,</span><span class="font4"> been awarded by Russia an order for twenty-three excavators worth $500,000 to be delivered in three months. An order for coal cutters was placed with a British firm for $775,000. The mayor of Newcastle reports that orders from Russia up to $150,000,000 will be placed in Britain if financial credit is arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Norway has voted to guarantee credit up to $20,000,000 for fish and other products ordered by Russia. Germany is financing all the orders Russia places with her. They are all at it. Russia is buying everything she wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canada probably believes she is setting the world a noble example in refusing to trade with Russia for the reason that the Russians do not go to church the ■way they should. But no other nation follow’s Canada’s example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Would. Have the Jeremiahs Silenced</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One would have thought that doing business with Russia might serve to help out somewhat the unemployment situation. But what matter the unemployed? Capitalism must live; and for Russia to succeed would mean the end of the capitalistic system and of world-wide unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of the unemployed and hard times the Saskatoon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> has little patience with those who would deceive themselves and others into thinking it is only psychic. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conservative newspapers throughout Canada are now engaged in showing, so far as in them lies, that the present depression in Canadian trade is a passing phase which we should bear with fortitude, and that the advocates of secession and other extreme measures are irresponsible agitators trying either to line their pockets or to embarrass the government. The reason for these assertions is clear. Falling wheat prices and rising unemployment are visible proof that Mr. Bennett has failed, to date at least, to make good his glowing promises to the Canadian public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the papers which object to references to present poverty, distress and discontent in the west the Winnipeg </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font4"> is the most articulate. Day after day it plays the role of Pollyanna, pointin™ with enthusiasm to a silver lining which others are unable to see. The fact that most people in the west have adequate food, clothing and shelter convinces the Winnipeg paper that all is reasonably well and that there is no cause for resentment or for exploring such radical proposals as a break with eastern Canada. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune’s</span><span class="font4"> latest blast on the subject is a denunciation of the Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font4"> for sending a reporter out west to describe conditions in the distressed areas. This writer has told some gloomy stories, including mention of the fact that where crop failure and low prices have hit hardest gunnysack is in use for clothing and dried gophers for food. The Winnipeg paper thinks this is “slandering” the west and that the Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font4"> ought to be ashamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This ostrich-like point of view is shared by Winnipeg’s chief magistrate, Mayor &quot;Webb, who in Saskatoon recently announced glibly that talk about hard times should be suppressed and that all the radical farmers could be put in one room. Many people are unable to agree with the Webb-jtVwwa theory that the unpleasant facts should be kept out of sight. It is true that no one in western Canada is dying of cold or starvation, but surely that can be taken for granted in the twentieth century in a country where modern production methods are known and used. Western Canada is aiming at something immeasurably better than living at a subsistence level, and the fact that a fair-sized minority of its people are just at that level, and would be below it but for charity, is shocking to any sensitive observer. The demand that this deplorable state of affairs should be hushed up surely establishes a new’ low for all times in political discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason for the hushing-up process is, quite evidently, a partisan reason. Conservative newspapers took a different line six months ago. Last summer, when wheat was $1.05 and the unemployed numbered 170,000, they thought it was a patriotic duty to view with alarm the state of industry, denounce those in authority and demand a change. Today, when wheat is 58 cents and there are 300,000 jobless, anyone who says that times are bad is a mean-spirited slanderer who wants to spoil poor Mr. Bennett’s sleep. That is about the size of the joyful noise-making now heard from the Pollyanna chorus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warm Belt in the Upper Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fliers of western Canada have been observing a very strange phenomenon: a layer of warm air spreads across the prairies at a height of from two thousand to three thousand feet, with temperature from thirty to fifty degrees higher. The Saskatoon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> reporting thereof states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Air mail pilots, winging their way over the prairies, have observed a phenomenon which so far has defied explanation by meteorologists and others who lay claim to weather wisdom. At 2,000- or 3,000-foot levels the air has on many occasions this winter been anywhere from 30 to 50 degrees warmer than at ground level. This strange vagary of old man Winter has been noticed to a greater or lesser extent in all parts of the prairie provinces, but has been more noticeable around Saskatoon and Regina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the airmen and the weather experts, this is contrary to all law’s of nature, and to any previous experiences. Pilots believe that it has something to do with the chinook winds which sweep in from the Pacific, but beyond that they can offer no explanation. Meteorological experts confess that they are completely baffled. They have never before heard of such a thing, and can offer no answer to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W. L. Brintnell, operating manager, Western Canada Airways, tells of one experience of this nature he had last winter. He took off in a temperature of 17 below zero. A dense fog forced him to fly within 200 feet of the ground. Suddenly he noticed a rift in the fog and climbed to a height of 3,000 feet. At once he noticed his oil temperature gauge rising very rapidly. He was at a loss to understand this till he put his hand outside and realized that the air w<sup>r</sup>as warm. Glancing at his thermometer, he saw that it w<sup>T</sup>as 45 above zero, 57 degrees higher than the temperature at ground level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little later the fog once more closed in around him and he was forced again to descend to the 200-foot level, -where he found that the mercury again registered 17 below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Queer pranks of the weather man have made flying difficult this winter. West of Moose Jaw there is no snow and no cold weather. Between Moose Jaw and Winnipeg, while not as cold as usual, it is nevertheless distinctly wintry weather. The result of this is a wide belt of heavy fog where the cold and warm weather meet. This has delayed the prairie air mail frequently during the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Birth in the Skies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News comes from the west that 4,000 feet in the air a baby was born in a plane. In true story-book fashion Mr. Stork, 1931 model and gasoline-propelled, arrived at The Pas from the north country carrying a bouncing boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Receiving an emergency call from Mile 214, Flight Lieut. A. L. McPhee, of the R. C. A. F., took to the air in his cabin monoplane and three hours later was winging his way back to The Pas with Mrs. Alex. Miller as his passenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifteen minutes after leaving Mile 214 on the return journey Baby Miller made his appearance at a height of four thousand feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both mother and son are reported as doing nicely today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Alas! Poor Ferguson!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What next? The Canadian Press informs us that a loyal Orangeman, none other than ExPremier Ferguson of Ontario, has been blessed by the pope. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hon. G. Howard Ferguson, Canadian high commissioner in London, who is attending the World Wheat Conference here, and Mrs. Ferguson today were received by the pope in private audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was merely a courtesy call,” Mr. Ferguson said afterward. “Later he will pay his respects to ‘his holiness’ on behalf of the Dominion,” Mr. Ferguson said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson were presented to the pope by G. A. D. Ogilvie-Forbes, charge d’affaires of the British ministry to the “holy see”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“His holiness” discussed Canada in a most cordial and interested manner with Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, and imparted the apostolic benediction before they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Atheism in the Universities</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In further evidence of the fact that most college professors have no faith in the Bible as the Word of God and are practical atheists, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font5"> adds in its testimony in a long editorial upon the matter, which in part we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ominous conditions have come to light in the public discussions of atheism in the colleges. That the students of two great universities should mention quite casually in their undergraduate dailies that atheism is a prevalent and well-recognized fact among students of the various schools, including even that of theology, has surprised and startled a considerable part of the general public. Yet it should not surprise us. For there is no gainsaying the fact noted by “A Student” in a letter in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe-.</span><span class="font4"> “Practical atheism is a world condition today, and a large and increasing number of people in everyday life practice it.” The same letter, however, shows ignorance of the facts when the writer says that “the classroom cannot be blamed for the practical atheism of the undergraduate body”, and that no subjects taught either in Applied Science or in Medicine could affect belief in God. It takes but slight familiarity with the teachings rife today in most college and university classrooms, and in such subjects as Science and Medicine, to have convincing proof that the instructors and professors arc constantly going out of their way to throw doubt or ridicule upon the teachings of the Bible, with the result of shattered faith on the part of students.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N THE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Guardian</span><span class="font5"> of Oklahoma Oscar Ameringer describes America at this time, and it is not a nice picture. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At least one third of labor is unemployed. At least one other third is only staggeringly employed. Millions of workers and tens of millions of human beings, if we embrace their families, are actually suffering from a lack of the prime necessities of life. Six hundred thousand railroad workers are permanently laid off. Thousands of conductors and engineers have been reduced to brakemen and firemen. The plight of the 500,000 coal miners alone is enough to cry to heaven. The campfires of tramping wage earners flicker along every railroad track. Desolate strings of homeless and jobless workers, men, women, and children, in soleless shoes and rickety Fords pass each other on the concrete roads, going north, south, east and west in search of work and bread. Labor leaders, these are not voluntary hoboes. They are the exodus of American labor from home and fireside. This is the slaughter of the innocents brought up to date and multiplied a thousand times. Can you not see that this is the crime of starving in the midst of plenty? The crime of willing workers locked out from the factories they built, the mines they sunk, the railroads they strung, the storehouses they filled with food and clothing. Strong arms, skilled hands, trained minds, begging for a chance to earn a living by honest toil, by giving twice for once and yet denied the chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dallas Pastor Hated Overalls</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A DALLAS pastor who nearly made a living as a hotel baggage man was found stripped, bound and hanged by the neck in his own church, but with his feet resting on a folding chair beneath him. When found he stated that he had been attacked by four masked men who had previously written him threatening letters. He has since admitted that he wrote the letters himself, and that he had trussed himself up with the rope; that his whole story was a lie. To make a success of the clergy business it is necessary to tell many lies, and this seemed to this man the reasonable thing to do. However, his fright at contact with the overalls is quite unfounded. If he becomes a good, honest, industrious porter he not only stands a chance of making a fair living in this world, but he will get something besides destruction in the world to come. And the clergy business is going to bring that to many. It is a bold man that will spend his life maligning and defaming Almighty God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TpROM reports which reach us, the Pittsburgh J- Coal Company’s Industrial Police are not different from the Pennsylvania Coal and Iron Police whom they have replaced. The reason, probably, is because they are the same individuals. We get the same stories of beating men and women over the head with clubs, including assaults on innocent bystanders, as we always get from western Pennsylvania wherever these armed anarchists are on the job. One woman, a pottery worker, not connected in any w<sup>r</sup>ay with the coal miners, stood waiting for a bus, and one of these entirely illegal officers of the law came along and hit her with a club. A sick woman was ordered out of her bed and out of her house because a striker ran into it for refuge, and a boarder in the same house was clubbed when he tried to escape the trouble by climbing out a cellar window. A farmer reports having seen tvro hundred men, women and children, knocked flat with clubs wielded by some of these horseback apostles of Big Business. The poor people thus clubbed are by these means given thorough lessons in what it means to be 100-percent American.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Batti is finding plenty of gravel in his spinach these days and mighty little comfort. In a burst of confidence to some the other day he disclosed that “all bishops declare that life is being made a burden to them, that they are constantly subjected to the most odious espionage, odious secret accusations and constant odious threats”. The old man is taking it pretty hard and, speaking for himself, said: “You perhaps expect me to say something special at this sad moment, but I do not wish to abuse your patience, and besides I would have to say too many bitter things.” It is just as well that the old gent shut off the gas. It would not do just now for him to ‘rile’ Mr. Mussolini too much. But the chances are good that Mussolini will throw the whole Vatican City works into the ash can before he finishes, and then the pope will be still sadder than he is now.</span></p>

It seems that &quot;Will wanted these erstwhile saints to glorify the movies for a consideration. Among the apostles so engaged was the former senior general secretary of the Federal Council of Churches of [Anti] christ in America, who pulled down $150 a month for eighteen months. Oh well, it was good while it lasted. But it is so embarrassing to have the payroll come up for air. Hays was sore because he thought, in these hard times, some of the dominies had the disposition of wanting to overload the payroll and work it overtime. He did not see doing it and so he spilled the beans, to the public’s delight. Meantime the dominies can remember his testimony in the halcyon days of the Teapot Dome investigation and can solemnly say to themselves (for that is where their prayers go), “0 Lord, I thank thee that I am not as other men.” When fibbers and grafters and hypocrites fall out, honest men laugh till they bust.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is not true that marriage is merely a betrothal, consummation being deferred until tire girl is reasonably mature. Pre-puberty consummation occurs to a far greater extent than may ordinarily be supposed, while, as for the rest of those married early, consummation soon after puberty is almost universal. The evidence gives us glimpses of the alliance of sacerdotalism, beastliness, prejudice, ignorance, and inertia behind which the custom is securely entrenched. As to its evil effects, Miss Mayo’s citations from the evidence and the report are sufficiently horrifying. Wc are left with the conviction that there is not today in the world another custom which produces so much oppression and suffering, physical or mental.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth About the So-called “Dole System” </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">overnor Joseph B. Elx, of Massachusetts, tells the plain truth about the so-called “dole system” when he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We in this country commonly speak of the British unemployment insurance as the British dole system. As a matter of fact it is not a dole system at all in the ordinary meaning of that word. Under it the employer contributes to a fund a percentage of his earnings, the state contributes a portion, and the worker a portion. This fund is utilized to equalize the wages . of those men and women who are unemployed through no fault of their own. It is a part of the cost of production. Contrary to the opinion in this country, it has generally operated successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this we may add that there would have been no unfavorable opinion of the British unemployment system in this country except for the malicious and dishonest prejudice against it aroused by the Judas press. America will have to come to it, anyway, and then the enemies and misrepresenters of it should be remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Senator Blaine on Redistribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TN A COMMENCEMENT address at Valparaiso University, Senator Blaine, of Wisconsin, made the following radical utterance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the masters of industry take their toll in inordinate salaries, bonuses, dividends, surplus inventories, and add to capital investment, there isn’t much left for the worker, and eventually he becomes the victim of unemployment. Today there is utter disgust with the universal order, and that disgust is being embittered by the sting of untold poverty. The clamor is being heard everywhere for legislation against the abuses of the capitalistic system. To my way of thinking and as I understand the history of the human race, a redistribution of wealth, and thus a redistribution of the income of wealth on the basis of services rendered and income earned, is the only means of escape from the present economic tragedy.</span></p>

The small, independent merchant, who knows the industries and the people of the community, is the strength of the country in a time of chaos, for it is to him that the worker looks for credit, and something should be done to offset the harm to his business that is done by the chain stores. They should pay heavier taxes than he does. He is a support to the state which they are not. When they have cash the people buy where they can buy cheapest, and that leaves the independent merchant to regain his footing as best he can. It is an unequal struggle.</span></p>

The railroads will not haul the peaches that are destroyed, so they will have to have the freight rates raised.

Goiter is common in Australia, where beef is the chief article of diet. When the amount of beef consumed is reduced the goitrous condition is helped. Goiter patients must see that the intestinal tract is kept active, and this can be done only by a diet principally of fruits and vegetables. In Japan, where seaweed is a common article of food, there are no cases of goiter.</span></p>

The big meat packers put the screws on the government, and hereafter all health bulletins must go through Andrew Mellon’s office, to be censored before they go out.

In the year 1931 New York city will expend about $7,000,000 for relief of the aged. This money is well spent, as it enables families to stay together.

<p><span class="font5">Crime and Punishment</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font5">NE cannot help wondering what is wrong:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why, with all our vigilance, all our criminal laws, all our police, all our penal institutions, crime of all kinds is growing in prevalence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are those (not the students of criminology) who feel the punishment provided ought to be more drastic, and that we are too kind to convicts in prisons; that a diet of bread and water, and the cold, hard floor of prison cells to sleep upon, a denial of all recreation, and every other possible means of making convicts feel their offense against society, should be meted out to the convicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only would such make the punishment fit the crime, but they would go back to the days when pocket-picking was punishable by death, and criminals were thrown to beasts of prey. But did the barbarous practice once in vogue serve as a deterrent of crime: did it deter? It did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the attitude of early Americans toward crime, and what they thought ought to be the penalties, failed, and failed because the inhuman policy, as we look upon it today, was bound to fail, we have adopted more humane penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Whipping, branding, hanging, maiming; chambers of torture; men’s bodies broken on a wheel; suspension by arms and legs, with great weights attached; their flesh burned by irons white hot; human bodies roasted over slow fires; bound alive; thrown to wild beasts; molten lead poured into the ears; faces of men placed toward the flaming sun and their eyes blinded; tied by the sea to be drowned by the rising tide; all these,” says Hon. A. C. Backus, formerly judge of the Municipal Court, Milwaukee, in an address before the National Probation Association at Washington, D. C., “have been tried, and victims have given up their lives by the millions, and yet so-called ‘criminals’ did not become extinct. It is a historical fact that crime increased with the imposition of these terrible penalties.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One would think that the category of fiendish and inhuman punishments cited by Judge Backus above includes all the possible cruelties; not so, for, “Let those who ascribe crime today to the lack of punishment,” says Platt, in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riddle of Society,</span><span class="font5"> 1926, “make new suggestions. And lest they be led into unnecessary experiment, let them remember, too, that the above does not include all that has been tried; there is, also, the pressing to death under great weights, the cut-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By C. F. Bley (New York)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ting off of the eyelids, the pulling out of the finger nails, the tearing out of the tongue, impaling on stakes, dismembering by wild horses, and the ripping-open of the body and tearing out the bowels.” And he adds, “We have carefully tried all of these; they need not be repeated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Did cruel punishment deter? Does capital punishment deter? Statistics say No! Even when, on one occasion, we ma.de a gala day of a public execution—when rural and suburban residents within fifty miles of Buffalo, came in all manner of conveyances—whole families— some of them came on foot—even barefoot, sixteen miles, to see a certain triple hanging, and pocket-picking was an offense punishable by death, and when the colonists made twenty offenses punishable by death,'there was no evidence that the punishment inflicted deterred crime. Pockets were picked while the (morbid) crowds were viewung public executions. And likewise when the authorities at Salem stopped burning witches, the good people of Salem were just as sure that they were right as their descendants today, and all other Americans who believe in capital punishment and other barbarous and inhuman treatment of convicts, think that they are right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problem of increasing crime is one that, to solve, will tax the best minds of the world. Mostly, criminals have perverted minds; but the cause of crime and crime waves will perhaps be found by far and large to be in our social and economic conditions and policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the first principles of therapeutics is to find the cause of the trouble, then the application of the remedy follows. Men steal who have plenty of money. Not. long ago a prominent man, to be more definite, the president of a railroad corporation, speaking at a convention of industrialists, on the problem of unemployment, said: “Enforced idleness is dangerous”; that men will steal before they starve; that he himself would; that his auditors, if they wanted to be frank, would confess they would do the same thing, and stealing is often associated with murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is more than likely that many murderers had themselves seen public executions even in America. In France, when executions were public, it was found, upon investigation, that, of 177 murderers, 174 had themselves witnessed the guillotining of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One potent cause of crime is poverty. (I am not unmindful of the fact that men steal who have plenty of money.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To a very large extent, that modern and wonderful invention, the automobile, is the cause of increasing crime. The quick and easy getaway by its use offers an inducement to steal. And the thought of possible apprehension lends zest to the undertaking, it seems, in some would-be criminals; but they have no intention of getting caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A typical example of the barbarous attitude once prevalent toward social offenders is cited by Barnes in “Repression of Crime” page 268, taken from the East Jersey Code of 1668 and modeled after the New Haven Code of 1642;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If any person within this province shall commit burglary, by breaking into a home, storehouse, warehouse, outhouse, or barn, or any other house whatsoever, or shall rob any person in the field or highways, he or they so offending shall for the first offense be punished by being burnt in the hand with the letter T, and make full satisfaction of the goods stolen; . . . and for the second time of offending in the like nature, besides the making of restitution, to be branded in the forehead with the letter </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R,</span><span class="font4"> and for the third offense to be put to death as incorrigible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Must we not blush with shame that our ancestors ever entertained such ideals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here’s What Happens to Cities That Sell Their Utilities </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By C. D. Thompson (Chicago)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5"> LITTLE over a month ago the village of Vassar, Michigan, (population 1,453) voted to sell its municipal light and power system. The power trust paid the city $160,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> few loyal and public-spirited citizens in Vassar did their uttermost to arouse their fellow citizens to the seriousness of the situation and the unfortunate results that would surely follow if the plant were sold. Among other things these opponents of the “sell out” warned the people that if the power companies got the plant they would immediately </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">inflate the capital account</span><span class="font5"> and the people would have to pay on the inflated values forever and a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the voters of Vassar swept all this wise counsel and warning aside and voted overwhelmingly to sell out, for the $160,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, with unusual swiftness, the power company moves to cash in on the Vassar people exactly as the wise ones warned them it would. In less than a month from the time of the voting of the sale the power companies applied to the State Commission and secured permission to issue $250,000 of bonds, $200,000 of preferred stock, and in addition certain amounts of “non-par value common stock”. In other words, the Vassar utilities, for which the city got the grand and glorious sum of $160,000, is now capitalized at over $450,000. And sooner or later, exactly as the opponents of the sale predicted, the people of Vassar will have to pay electric rates sufficient to yield </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iy<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font5"> to 8 percent on this whole $450,000 which yesterday the village sold to the company for $160,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">More About the Corn Sugar Dictum </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By H. E. Coffey {Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5"> HAVE read with interest the article &quot;As to Dextrose in Honey—A Correction” in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden 'Age</span><span class="font5"> No. 306, page 596. I am afraid that Mr. Roy A. Ryan does not understand the full intent of Secretary Arthur M. Hyde’s ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that honey was the only food specifically mentioned as being exempt from adulteration by this ruling is to be accounted for because of the long and stubborn fight that beekeepers have made against corn sugar legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your readers should know that legalizing the substitution of an entirely different and. inferior ingredient without declaration on the label is diametrically opposed to the very intent of the Pure Food Laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heretofore consumers could know, in the absence of a declaration on the label, that food was sweetened with cane or beet sugar. Corn sugar is chemically different from cane and beet sugar, and its physiological effects are different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are sensitive to any special kind of sugar and suffer from eating it have now lost their former right of knowing in advance what sweetener was used in the food they purchase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No former secretary of agriculture has dared take the liberty that Mr. Hyde has in this instance taken, and it leaves the way open, if his ruling stands, for yet other changes in the Pure Food Laws by which they will eventually be completely emasculated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Corn sugar manufacturers will, no doubt, soon ask that their other product, glucose, be given special privileges in regard to labeling and thus bring back those common adulterations so notorious before the days of the Pure Food Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By this ruling the manufacturers of oleomargarine have ample precedent for demanding that their product be permitted to be sold without informing consumers that it is oleo instead of butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last July, at a hearing called by the secretary of agriculture preceding his ruling, spokesmen for the American Canners’ Association begged the secretary not to make such a ruling, as canners do not want to use corn sugar in their products and they realize the danger in making such a breach in the Pure Food Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The National Preservers’ Association and the National Wholesale Grocers’ Association also urged against the ruling. Thus the very people who are supposed to use this corn sugar have indicated that they cannot use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand the farmers who produce the corn have repeatedly expressed themselves against making this breach in the Pure Food Laws to help corn sugar manufacturers. Many state farm bureaus have passed repeated resolutions against impending corn sugar legislation, and so have other farmers’ organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is amusing to note in his explanation accompanying his ruling that the secretary of agriculture states there is a potential market for 5,000,000 to 100,000,000 bushels of corn per annum through the corn sugar route, thus intimating strongly that his ruling would benefit the corn grower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time his ruling was issued, December 26, 1930, (a Christmas present, no doubt, to Corn Products Refining Company) the corn sugar interests were promising the farmers loudly that if only the secretary would make this ruling, immediately the prices of corn would advance. Since that date the prices of corn have steadily declined and these corn sugar propagandists are now explaining why the benefits of the ruling should not be expected to take effect immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One wonders, too, how the Honorable (?) Secretary of Agriculture could have made this promise concerning the increased consumption of corn by corn sugar manufacturers when the food packers who are supposed to use this corn sugar frankly told the secretary they could not use corn sugar in their products on account of its peculiar nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indeed the corn sugar manufacturers have known all along that this ruling will not create a new outlet for corn sugar. What is their objective? you may inquire. It cannot be surmised otherwise than that they desire further exceptions in their favor and ultimately the complete destruction of the Pure Food Law, at least so far as it relates to corn sugar and glucose, the notorious food adulterant before the days of the Pure Food Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the federal regulations in regard to the enforcement of the Pure Food Law apply only to interstate shipments, there is a second wall of defense that the corn sugar interests must break down before the ruling of Secretary Hyde is effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the state food commissioners have, at one time or another, expressed themselves as strongly opposed to adulteration of food with corn sugar. The corn sugar interests are now seeking to break down this opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Ryan is correct in his intimation that the m</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lin</span><span class="font5">g of Secretary Hyde does not change the Pure Food Lav/. The ruling is simply a declaration on the secretary’s part that he will not enforce the intent of the Pure Food Law in his department as it relates to the substitution of corn sugar for sugar, while at the same time he will enforce the law in all other cases of substitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would seem that Mr. Hyde would be in a most embarrassing position in this respect. But his corn sugar friends are helping him and are using every effort to compel the state food commissioners to follow the secretary’s ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently a bill was up in the Michigan legislature, Senate Bill 101, which would prohibit the substitution of corn sugar or corn syrup in other food without mention on the label. Typical corn sugar methods were used in fighting the bill, and a circular was sent to beekeepers and others in the state stating that the bill, if enacted into law, would legalize the adulteration of food products. This, of course, was exactly v/hat the provisions of the bill were designed to prohibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be expected that insidious false propaganda will be put out everywhere that the occasion demands, and continuously until these profit-craving, “the people be damned” interests achieve their ends, New Mexico alone being excepted because it has no Pure Food Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Attraction of Gravitation Not Universal </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I. B. Alford (Texas')</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font5">HEN Sir Isaac Newton announced his discovery of the alleged “universal law of gravitation” he took a long step in the right direction. This was the beginning of the understanding of one of the great problems of material substance and force. But it is not the end; as we shall see. In order that we may have his thoughts on this question properly before our minds for this study we quote his announced law as given in modern school textbooks on physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Law of gravitation: “Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely as the square of their distance apart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not the purpose of the writer to deny that in all bodies belonging to this earth there is a constant attracting force between the earth and these bodies. It is this attracting force that causes all free bodies in atmospheric space to fall to the earth when unsupported. This attraction of the earth for earthly substances is called “gravity”, as distinguished from alleged universal attraction called “gravitation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We now consider the so-called ‘constant attraction’ claimed for “gravitation” in relation to the earth’s orbital movement around the sun. It is held, and correctly s.o, we think, that the earth’s annual path around the sun is not a circle, but an ellipse, the sun being at one of the foci of this ellipse. Under this arrangement it is held that the earth spins around the sun in an elongated orbit at distances varying from 92,000,000 miles in perihelion to 95,000,000 miles in aphelion. To the writer’s mind it is difficult to reconcile this variation of 3,000,000 miles to the claim of a constant attractive force, because the earth deliberately recedes from the sun during half the time occupied in its annual journey around the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order that we may have this matter properly before our minds we present in the accompanying diagram a picture of the earth in its orbit with the sun at one focus, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">S,</span><span class="font5"> of the ellipse.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark14"></a>,...-&quot;0<sup>S</sup>----------</span><br><br><span class="font8"><sup><a name="bookmark15"></a>c</sup>0 ®S</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">-----------</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A, B, C,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">D,</span><span class="font5"> respectively, represent the earth at different times of the year, and in different positions with reference to the sun. In position </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> the earth is approximately 95,000,000 miles from the sun; while in the vicinity of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C </span><span class="font5">it is only about 92,000,000 miles distant. During its passage from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font5"> by way of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font5"> it is attracted by the sun, because it approaches the sun. But in its passage from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font5"> back to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> the earth increases its distance from the sun by 3,000,000 miles. This indicates </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> attraction but repulsion during the six months intervening while the earth is passing from perihelion to aphelion. The writer is not disregarding the commonly claimed and generally accepted explanation that this variation is caused by the alternating proximity and remoteness of other planets, the two opposing forces (centripetal and centrifugal), but questions the reasonableness of such explanations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When two bodies are poised in space, if one approaches the other it is because it is attracted by the other. On the other hand, if one recedes from the other it is because it is repelled by the other. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that during half its journey around the sun the earth is attracted by the sun, because it approaches the sun; but, during the other half of this distance the earth is evidently repelled by the sun, since it recedes from the sun. If the Law of Gravitation, which claims that attraction decreases as the square of the distance increases, is true, then this alleged attraction must of necessity increase as the distance decreases. If it increases as the distance decreases, as is claimed by the advocates of universal attraction, then the earth could not, under this increased attraction, deliberately recede from the sun; but must needs yield to the increased attraction tending to rush the earth directly into contact with the sun. This would indeed be a calamity precipitating the alleged “end of the w<sup>T</sup>orld”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer now offers what appears to be a reasonable explanation of this phenomenon by reference to the generally accepted conclusions of scientists that the earth is a great magnet. This process of deduction forces the conclusion that the sun is a greater magnet. Now it is common knowledge that “like magnets repel; unlike, attract”. We follow this line of reasoning by assuming the sun to be the immense primary, or positive, magnet, and the earth the secondary one. The earth, therefore, as the secondary magnet, is amenable to the attracting force of the sun, and is for a time drawn toward the sun. But as it approaches nearer and nearer the sun it becomes gradually “charged” by the accumulation of magnetic energy from the sun. Under its accumulated momentum it continues to advance along the line of compromise between centrifugal and centripetal forces. At all points in its orbit closer than the mean distance from the sun the earth would accumulate magnetism in excess of the amount given off. The closer to the sun the greater the amount of this energy received. The earth finally becomes “charged”, that is, it possesses sufficient energy to cause it to become primary, or positive. In this state the earth is like the sun in that it has become thus charged. Under this condition it becomes repelled by the sun, and gradually begins to recede from the sun. It continues in this manner to flee from the sun until, having passed beyond its mean distance from the sun, it begins to lose its primary magnetism again in proportion to its increase of distance until it again becomes a secondary magnet amenable to attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earth, when at mean distance, would receive and discharge magnetic energy in equal amounts; but in aphelion, greatest distance from the sun, it would discharge this energy in excess of that received. Returning to mean distance it would tend to be neutral again, but its accumulated momentum rushes it forward till increasing resistance finally arrests its course again in perihelion, when it rushes not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">into</span><span class="font5"> the sun, as it must do under attraction, if the alleged “law of gravitation” be true, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">around</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">arvay</span><span class="font5"> from the sun, being urged on by the accumulated energy which, again renders it positive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally, it appears that this line of thought would explain in a satisfactory manner the causes of the variation of inclination of the earth on its axis. It is known that by far the greater part of the land surface of the earth is in the northern hemisphere. This hemisphere, by reason of greater irregularities and variations of altitude resulting from such excess land surfaces, would necessarily be found to be more responsive to these alternating changes of attraction and repulsion. That is to say: Since the northern hemisphere has a greater mass surface to be attracted, or repelled, by the sun, it must of necessity vary by swinging toward the sun under attraction, and away from the sun under repulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And this is exactly what is done. The amount of this variation is 47 degrees. On account of this variation the sun rays are vertical over the earth at stated times (mean distance) from a point 23^/2 degrees north of the equator in June to a point 23y<sub>2</sub> degrees south thereof in December. Under the impulse of attraction this greater mass surface of the northern hemisphere is pulled toward the sun, whose rays are vertical over that point farthest north, at or near aphelion; while, under the effects of repulsion this greater mass surface of the northern hemisphere recedes from the sun at or near perihelion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, by alternating attracting and repelling forces, the earth, at times approaching to, then receding from, the sun, is maintained in its suspended and designated path, an eternal unit of that great system in which it plays its part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ain’t Science Wonderful! </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Melville J. Eames (Illinois')</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5"> HAVE just read of a wonderful corroboration of the Scriptures by another of those breath-taking and awe-inspiring discoveries of our super-scientists. The most remarkable part of it is that their deductions are supposed to prove the truth of a Bible statement, which is, as you all know, contrary to the usual custom of scientists. Here it is, with all the wisdom of the ages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“British scientists recently examined the mummy of Pharaoh Menephtah, which may have been the Pharaoh of which the Bible says, ‘And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh,’ for the scientists have found the heart actually hardened and in its aorta patches of calcified chemicals indicating that he probably suffered and died from angina pectoris.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The article does not state whether or not the scientists believe the Lord is to blame for all the hardened aortas and other arteries so prevalent today, but probably that’s as good a place to put the blame as any. So many things have been put onto the Lord that He is not responsible for that one more would not make much difference, and if the Lord hardens the people’s arteries, you couldn’t blame the scientists for not curing them. That would make quite an acceptable alibi, and one to which most preachers could say Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The article continues to throw further light on the course of poor old Pharaoh’s heart trouble, and the prognosis doesn’t seem to be very good. “Science has recently discovered that the chemical fluids of the system of infiltration become crystallized when internal secretions of certain endocrines (ductless glands) are for a long time deficient, showing that if Menephtah’s endocrine system had been functioning normally, he would not have died from calcified patches in his heart.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As I remember the vivid description of the ten plagues through which “his royal majesty” and subjects passed, I am not in the least surprised to hear that his endocrine system was a trifle off balance. Just recall the rivers of blood, the land filled with frogs, lice and flies, the beasts and people smitten with grievous murrain and with boils and blains, the hail, thunder and fire, locusts, darkness, and finally the death of all Egypt’s first-born. If anyone’s endocrine system could stand all of that without being shocked out of its proper balance, it must have been strengthened by monkey or goat gland transplantation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely the scientists are right, Pharaoh’s endocrine system must have been somewhat below par; and I for one don’t blame this system for balking at a supernatural display that would make even a World War veteran’s endocrines somewhat wobbly. And if Pharaoh Menephtah didn’t have angina pectoris, I’m sure he had some sort of queer feeling around his heart every time he saw Moses and Aaron come in for conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But just as there were flies in Egypt from the plagues, so there is here “a fly in the ointment”. I hesitate to call your attention to it, for whenever I am confronted by the wisdom of scientists I feel humble and awed and it is indeed with great difficulty that I pull myself out of this inferiority complex to call your attention, gentle reader, to the mistake made in signing Pharaoh’s death certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am quite certain my own opinion would be of no greater value than a scientist’s, but when I can give the testimony of one of the thousands of eye witnesses to Pharaoh’s ‘tragic death’, I feel quite confident that I cannot be successfully contradicted when I say that this hard-hearted old Pharaoh passed to his reward by drowning in the Red Sea rather than by coming to his end during an attack of angina pectoris induced by a faulty endocrine system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here are the words of Moses, as true today as when he wrote them, in Exodus 15:19: “For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them.” “Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.” —Ex. 14:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But to give the scientists the benefit of any doubt, it might have been that as Pharaoh neared the middle of the sea and saw the wall of waters on both sides about to engulf him and his boy friends, his endocrine system, already weakened by the strain of the preceding days, with one last but hopeless effort to right itself, gave up its struggle against the Almighty, thereby precipitating the most severe and final attack of angina pectoris just in time to save him from drowning. Naturally the hardened condition of his heart would make him heavy enough to sink, and so to all but the scientific-minded he appeared to have drowned even as the thousands of horsemen with him did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, of course, at that time no one knew the real cause of his death; and when his body was washed ashore, no doubt some of the leading men of Egypt who had remained at home rather than take part in such a risky fight (even as the manner of some is today) found it, embalmed it carefully and laid it to rest. What a source of regret it must have been to the wise men of that day not to have known the cause of their king’s sudden departure!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one time Pharaoh asked Moses, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?” Perhaps when he wakes up from his long sleep of death and finds himself in the midst of God’s kingdom on earth instead of in the Red Sea, he will know who the Lord is and will have learned enough to obey His voice. If he does learn this great lesson of obedience, he may be one of those of whom the Lord says, “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In closing I wish to assure all the scientists everywhere that if Pharaoh gets this new heart of flesh it will be accompanied by a sound endocrine system as well, but Pharaoh and all the scientists will have to do a whole lot better than in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Banana Oil Fumes and Aluminum Castings</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5"> SUBSCRIBER, referring to an item in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> entitled “Poisonous Fumes from Aluminum Paint”, makes a correction, and gives some extremely interesting information regarding utensils and castings made of this metal. His letter follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fumes from aluminum paint, which you specify as so deadly, were due to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">banana oil,</span><span class="font5"> and not from the aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We are manufacturers of aluminum castings ; also use aluminum paint. We thoroughly agree with you that aluminum cooking utensils are poisonous in the extreme; and also that in melting aluminum the strong fumes rising from the molten mass cause horrible boils or abscesses to develop on the skin of the hands or the faces of the men pouring the metal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our patrons order aluminum castings, besides those of brass, copper, iron. We would prefer not to supply those of aluminum, which are mainly sink-strainers, small ventilators, etc., but cannot refuse to fill the orders, because our line of work is in the various metals mentioned above, and we cannot make any exceptions. We condemn the use of aluminum dishes at every opportunity. We do not use such dishes, nor baking powders containing aluminum sulphate, nor medicine whose contents possess it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In common honesty we must say that aluminum in the paint gives forth no deadly fumes, but the banana oil with which the paint is mixed is dangerous and overpowering, and when breathed in a confined space will produce collapse and possibly death to persons not physically strong. As far as the aluminum paint goes, let’s give the Devil his due. I am a reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> and a lover of its truths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Common Salt </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Wm. B. Hathaway (Michigan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T AM much interested in the article on “Com-i mon Salt” by Mr. II. J. North, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font5">No. 306. I have not been able to study the subject all I want to, but I feel that the readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> should have more information on this subject without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There are grave dangers connected with the excessive use of common salt, and no one should ignorantly feed salt to anyone. Common salt is one of the materials used by some persons with which to commit suicide. Eight ounces of salt will kill a hog. A forty-pound dog given about three ounces of salt falls into convulsions and dies. In China the drinking of a saturated solution of salt is a common mode of committing suicide, and none more difficult to treat. Sometimes the brine from salted kraut is used, half pint to one pint is the usual amount taken by the suicide.”—From </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Dietetics,</span><span class="font5"> by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, pages 444, 445.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On page 446, Dr. Kellogg states that Bright’s disease is due to excessive use of salt. On page 448 he says, “'Salt should be eliminated in diabetes, in syphilis, as well as in dropsy, from disease of the heart, liver and kidneys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Page 449: “The excessive use of common salt raises arterial pressures very readily in. subjects already suffering from arteriosclerosis. The course of scarlet fever is greatly modified for the better when salt is eliminated from the diet. In pneumonia, as well as in typhoid and other fevers, there is a tendency to salt accumulation which seems to be due to the influence of the poisons upon the body cells and not alone to the inability of the kidneys to eliminate the chlorine salt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On page 100 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Science of Keeping Young,</span><span class="font5"> by Alfred W. McCann: “Nobody ever said (except perhaps a few cranks) that sodium in the form of sodium chloride (common sea salt) is not necessary to health. The trouble is that most people consume about 20 grams daily, which is probably at least ten times as much as is really necessary to meet the needs of the body. There can be no doubt that this excessive consumption of sodium chloride is not only needless, but actually harmful. There is abundant proof that large quantities of salt actually retard the process of digestion. It is noteworthy that the craving for salt seems to be especially strong among vegetarians, for which reason, as in the case of the animals that go to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">the ‘’salt licks’, mother nature herself seems to suggest its use to those who need it. No proof that it is injurious to health if consumed temperately.” (“Mother nature” is McCann’s expression, not ours.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is from an article by Dr. La Verne Barber in the magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Your Body, </span><span class="font5">summer edition, 1929, page 24: “To salt or not to salt? Better not. Salt extracts moisture from the air. It does the same with your cells. Mix salt with yoke of egg (to concentrate it), and use this hyper-saline as a poultice when for any reason you seek an inlet to the tissues. By dehydration, the salt will neatly dig a hole there. Soaked in brine (salt water in strong solution), meat turns white as the fibers lose their color and their interstitial juices. Along with paste or glue, salt will promote constipation. Ship-•wrecked sailors drink salt water and go mad. Why then do animals seek a salt lick? Why do their pelts go mangy and lose their luster when salt is withheld? Nine-tenths of one per cent is the norm of blood alkalinity. To plus or minus this invites disease. Confined to grass and grain when their food fails to contain the proportion of salt, animals seek a salt lick. Instinct is a faithful veterinary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following by Will R. Lucas in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Health Culture',</span><span class="font5"> July, 1929, pages 287, 288: “Sodium chloride, or common table salt, is used in large quantities by most people. Those who are wise enough to take no salt get along well without it, which shows that it is not needed in large amounts. If a little is added to foods, it does no perceptible harm; but when sprinkled on everything that is eaten, it is without doubt harmful. Sodium chloride or common salt is an inorganic compound and as such cannot be utilized by the body. It should, in fact, be regarded as a mild poison and an irritant. Yet we are told by a physician in the daily press that ‘sodium chloride, or common salt, probably ranks first among all the salts in the human body; both in quantity and in nutrition value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This physician makes the same mistake as many of his medical associates. Sodium chloride does not play a vital part in diet, nor does it have any value in the body’s nutrition. Under our present conditions of living, w<sup>T</sup>e generally partake of too much carbonaceous and nitrogenous food, and get too little of the precious mineral salts, except sodium chloride, which as </span><span class="font2">854 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">I have pointed out, is usually taken in too great quantity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. George Starr White tells us that “Nature puts her own salts into all vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs and flowers. When these foods are cooked, the natural salts are changed, and that is why so-called civilized people crave for artificial salt. The eating of salt by humans or any other animal is an acquired habit. Nature puts into her natural food all the salt that should be eaten with it. That much salt takes care of all that goes out of the body through the skin, kidneys and other glands. The use of salt more than nature intended causes an abnormal interchange of fluids in the body, and much toxic material that should naturally go off in the waste matter from the body is reabsorbed and a general toxemia is the result. The symptoms or such “salt toxemia’ are general malaise, tired feeling, fullness after meals, bloating, gas pressure in stomach and bowels, palpitation of the heart, headaches, etc. In the course of my work I have come across many people who have been suffering from salt poisoning and who have been greatly improved in health through giving salt a wide berth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Jaws of Death </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. John Studd (Missouri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5"> CAN no longer refrain from telling you how grateful I am for the information I got through your paper on the subject of aluminum, showing me where I stood, and most of my family, which was at the jaws of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I purchased a set of aluminum utensils from an agent. After using them for sometime, I became weak, weaker and weaker. </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font5">never saw </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">well day. My heart troubled me; I had sick and nervous headaches so dreadful that if the family made the least bit of noise or spoke above </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">whisper, it seemed as though it would drive me wild. Frequently I suffered agony from pains in my stomach. I could not sit up or lie down and be quiet, but walked the floor. I was deathly sick. The doctor gave me medicine which deadened the pain. I usually recovered from these spells in a week or ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My daughter nineteen years of age, grew very pale, was extremely nervous, had sleepless nights, was always weak and tired, had vomiting spells, and was dizzy-headed. Little daughter, age eight years, missed almost one-half the school term on account of stomach trouble and headache. Her little schoolmates said among themselves, “Geneva won’t live much longer.” When I heard this it grieved me much, for I wrns doing all I could for the child. But the puzzle was, What could be her ailment? knowing her father and I, also our ancestors, had always been well and strong, and now we were wrecks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I canned one hundred quarts of blackberries and one hundred quarts of tomatoes, all cooked in an aluminum utensil. My husband said he believed blackberries w’ere not healthful, for he felt sick after eating them. I felt the effects after partaking of either the tomatoes or blackberries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My married daughter and her husband came to take Sunday dinner with us. Our dinner was very plain. We had stewed chicken with gravy cooked in an aluminum container, and blackberry pie. The blackberries had been canned, as before mentioned. Son-in-law ate heartily of the chicken and gravy and became sick in the afternoon; was sick all that week. Friend husband said he did not feel well either. At first I laughed and said, “I could see nothing the matter with the dinner.” I was sick all the time and went lightly on food, sometimes omitting entirely heavy foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time after this happened we read the article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> explaining how different foods being cooked in an aluminum container form different acids as they mix with the aluminum that cooks off the utensil, and that aluminum is harmful to the system. I’ll say it is harmful. It’s a deadly poison, for I have been poisoned many times during its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Friend husband did not have quite enough aluminum yet. I said I would stock up with granite ware. Husband said, “You just cook my food in aluminum.” All right; so I did. My food was cooked in granite ware. I was rapidly improving; he was failing, and failing fast. One day he said, “I just don’t know what is the matter with me, but it may be that aluminum; everything I eat is cooked in aluminum.” I at once secured larger granite utensils, and away with aluminum. So our trouble was solved at last and we all feel better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">N THE summer 01 1929, Norman Baker of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Muscatine, Iowa, publisher of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">TNT</span><span class="font5"> magazine, appointed a committee to investigate a claim that cancer is curable without operations, X-ray or radium. Six patients were selected for the test. They were treated by medical applications in external cases and by an injection method in internal cases, and the results were so gratifying that a careful investigation was made of cases previously treated by the same methods and it was decided to open a hospital for cancer patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Baker employed doctors to do the work of treating the patients, but because he was a layman the American Medical Association started a persistent campaign of persecution against him, even causing the closing down of the great radio station KTNT, and he has had to lease the hospital to another man, an M.D. KTNT has been powerfully used to broadcast the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite the fact that Mr. Baker has deposited a certified check for $5,000 with the American Savings Bank of Muscatine payable to any person who furnishes evidence that he has made one false statement regarding cancer’s having been and now being cured at the Baker hospital, the work of Mr. Baker and his friends is being destroyed by emissaries of the Medical Trust. Some of these men openly claim that they can get what they want in the way of legislation and legislative action by merely reaching for the ’phone and ’phoning their legislators. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Is that so?</span><span class="font5"> Since when did our legislators, our servants, own us, body and soul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Well, we know nothing about Mr. Baker’s hospital except that he shows pictures of nineteen cancer cases before and after treatment that are nothing short of miraculous as to what was accomplished, and the letters from patients who have been treated are as convincing as the pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And just because we believe in fair play, and are opposed to tyranny, we advise every subscriber of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> who is interested to drop a line to Baker Hospital, Muscatine, Iowa, and ask for a free copy of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cancer Is Curable.</span><span class="font5"> It won’t do anybody any harm to read the story of how the Medical Trust has tried to ruin Mr. Baker, and it may result in much good to many who are suffering and wondering what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Vivisection of Humans Actually Under Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font5">OE some time we have foreseen that vivisection of humans, or, in other words, their skilled and needless torture for so-called scientific purposes, could not be long delayed. The world has become too callous, too godless, too inhuman to defer what has been in the mind of the vivisectors for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the London Sunday </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Express,</span><span class="font5"> May 17, 1931, we quote in part from an article on “Torturing Babies; A Strange Scientific Experiment”. The article is from the pen of James Douglas. It refers to experiments of Dr. John B. Watson, formerly professor of psychology and director of the psychological laboratory in Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Douglas begins our excerpt with a quotation from Mr. Watson’s pen, and follows with his own comments, which are enough without anything from us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We were rather loth at first to conduct experiments in this field,” says Watson, “but the need of study was so great that we finally decided to build up fear in an infant. We chose as our first subject Albert B., an infant -weighing 21 pounds at eleven months of age. He was a wonderfully good baby. In all the months we worked with him we never saw him cry until after our experiments were made!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It used to be said that a good man is one who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before. A “behaviorist” is a scientist who makes a baby cry who has never cried before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How did they make Albert cry ? A white rat, which he had played with for weeks, was presented to Albert. He began to reach for the rat. Just as his hand touched the rat a steel bar was struck with a carpenter’s .hammer immediately behind his head. The infant jumped violently, and fell forward, burying his face in the mattress. He did not cry, however. That is experiment No. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They struck the bar again. The infant jumped violently, fell forward, and began to whimper. On account of his disturbed condition no further tests</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">were made for one week. Then the infant was afraid of the rat which had been his playmate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, the instant the rat was shown the baby began to cry. He fell over, raised himself on all fours, and began to crawl away so rapidly that he was caught with difficulty before he reached the edge of the mattress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They experimented on Albert for five days. By that time he was frightened by everything he had played -with. The experiments on Albert were stopped because he was adopted by an out-of-town family. Then in 1923 a sum of Rockefeller money was granted to enable the behaviorists to experiment on seventy children ranging in age from three months to seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was not an ideal place for our experimental work because we were not allowed full control of the children. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Snakes are used in these horrible torments of children. “Just as I show the snake,” says Watson, “I can make a terrible noise and cause the child to fall down and cry out completely terror-stricken. Soon the mere sight of the snake will have the same effect. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The process of conditioning a child by a sort of fire ordeal is then described; “A child can be conditioned by a severe burn with one stimulation, but this involves a severe reaction. By presenting the candle flame many times and each time letting it just heat the finger enough to produce withdrawal of the hand, a negative conditioned response can be built up without the severe feature of shock. Building in negative responses without shock requires time, however.” These experiments prove, it seems, that the burned child dreads the fire!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only a devil would experiment on a new-born babe. Fear reaction, we are told, “can best be observed in new-borns just when they are falling asleep. If dropped then the response usually occurs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I will issue a challenge to these torturers of children. Instead of their torturing babies let them allow us to torture them. I would undertake to cure Watson in a week if I had him at my mercy with a hammer and a steel bar. I could make him jump farther than any helpless baby. I could condition his reflexes so violently that he would begin to reflect. And I guarantee that my laboratory notes would be more interesting than his piffle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One experiment I should like to carry out is very simple. I Would let him see a baby and hit him on the head with a hammer. I predict that after a course of my conditioning he would not go near a baby without a howl of fear. He has taught babies to fear him. I would teach him to fear babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eight Diseases——All for Eighteen Dollars </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By A. Burton Worley (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5"> HAD an ailment of itching. One said it was a parasite I got in Florida last winter. Now maybe he was right, but as he did not examine me to see what kind of a critter it was, I thought, after paying him $3, I would call on some others, which I did, with the following information. I found I had:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font4">Auto-intoxication </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font4">Sysphis </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font4">Anemia </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font4">Diabetes </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font4">Tuberculosis of the blood </span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font4">Itch</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font4">Malaria</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">I had bought a used iron bedstead. Under the pipe at head and at foot I found a hole, and after sealing those holes with adhesive tape, taking a good rubdown of sulphur and lard, and cleaning and renovating my house, by smoke-screen and spray, I got rid of those friendly bedbugs and all their relations, and now I don’t itch. Strange those doctors could not detect a bedbug bite. I guess it was the dollars they were after. Now I don’t have anything to do with them. This is the absolute truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some Honest Doctors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In 1805 Dr. Mosley discovered that syphilis ■was communicable by vaccination, but it was not until 70 years later that the majority of the profession were convinced of the fact. Pathology has taught us long since that syphilis may be conveyed by infected blood or the secretions which are its offsprings. Statistics complete the evidence by showing that the deaths from infantile syphilis per million births were under enforced vaccination (1867-1878) 1,738, as compared with 564 under voluntary vaccination (1847-1853).” Dr. W. J. Collins, B.Sc., M.B., M.R.C.S., writing from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, England, September 10, 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font5"> large proportion of the cases apparently inherited syphilis, are in reality vaccinal.” Dr. Carter, of St. George’s Hospital, London.</span></p>

We have just gotten a radio set, and I have just heard your wonderful talk. You can well know my surprise when the announcer said you would speak on the Second Coming of Christ. In your talk I was able to understand as never before just what this great event will mean. I thank you so much for that talk. Will you please send me the booklet of your books ?”</span></p>

(From a prominent business man) “I have listened to your talks over the radio on Sunday and think your lectures are the most interesting I have heard. Will you kindly send me some of your literature to enlighten me on the words of Jesus Christ, so I may understand them better. You seem to explain almost every word as you go along in your lectures. I listen to you every Sunday with great interest. I will appreciate any books you might send me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Courageous Pastor</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font5">S MOST of our readers are aware, the &quot;church” business is about done. Some of the pastors themselves are seeing it, among them the Reverend Paul Little, rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church, Chico, California. Reverend Little has put out a questionnaire in which he is trying to find out why well-meaning men do not go to church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His letter and questionnaire were sent to a select group of serious-minded men to ascertain their candid and honest opinions. Reverend Little declares that only fifteen percent of the attendants at church are men, and he thinks there, must be a reason. (And there is.) The questionnaire was to be secret; i. e., persons who answered it were not to reveal their identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The questionnaire asks that the following questions be checked as to reasons for not going to church.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. I can worship God in the open air......................</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. I want to play golf or go motor-riding........................</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">10. I have gotten out of the habit of going.................—.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">11. Other reasons.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">We </span><span class="font5">think the Reverend Little is to be congratulated on this list. No doubt most of those to whom he sent it will feel like putting a check after each item. But why stop with ten reasons when there are so many? We add a few which he has overlooked and start to number again from 1 up.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font5">T WAS a cold December morning, several inches of snow having fallen during the night, and a long black line of hearse, sedans and people moved slowly toward the Lynbrook Cemetery. It was the funeral of John Richman. During his life Mr. Richman had spent fifty years in collecting money for himself, well over nine millions of dollars. The amount of his personal property was not revealed until the time of his last sickness. He collected his wealth through little effort of his own: investments in bonds over a long period of time had accumulated this large sum. He was regarded with indifference by others, generally because they did not know’ of his money. But, when this unpopular miser's wealth was revealed in the evening newspapers in what was styled a “fatal sickness”, many &quot;who had been indifferent toward him and even scoffed at him became very solicitous. Every convenience possible was offered to him to make his last hours comfortable, flowers were brought, words of sympathy were passed freely, and several of the softhearted were seen to shed tears profusely while in his presence. It is surprising what strange friendships are created over night by the tinkle of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what had been the concern of the deceased, John Richman? It was the hoarding of riches. But it is strange that a man should spend fifty years collecting a little cash here and a greater sum there, bringing it all together in one place. He did not bring anything into the earth that was not here before he came; he had just moved some of the world’s goods from one place to another. He took nothing with him when he went away. Not considering how much work, sweat, suffering and other things that were expended by laborers who earned this money for Mr. Richman, it can hardly be said that the world ■was any better off 'when he left it than before he came. Mr. Richman’s life was spent much like that of a play-boy who early in the morning began to pile up sand upon the sea shore; when evening came he laid down his bucket and little shovel, and went to sleep. That night the waves of the ocean came and took him and his sand pile away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strange as the action of John Richman may seem, it will seem stranger still when we consider that all but a very few people on earth have built sand piles only to have them left behind and scattered at life’s evening. These sand piles have involved not only money, but other things as well: real estate, houses, household furnishings, books, friends, reputation, children, mothers, fathers, cathedrals, cities, kingdoms, and empires, yes, everything when used out of accord with what should be man’s chief concern. It is not a bad thing to have possessions, at least the necessities of life, but the possession of such when used for selfish purposes and not the end purposed by the Creator, Jehovah God, leads to trouble, discontent, fright, terror, lunacy, suicide, and all the sorrow’s and evils that beset mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But some millionaire or billionaire will say, ‘That does not apply to me. I give large sums of money for the benefit of mankind.’ That may be true, but the money that was given existed in some form in the earth before the would-be giver came into possession of it. These gifts are largely selfish, and the ends to which they are put are often worthless when lasting value is concerned. Certainly that could not be man’s chief concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difficulty with man in acquiring wealth is that selfishness is his motive. He does not have in mind the purpose for which all things are brought into existence. He sets his heart upon his possessions for his own good. Calamities come which interfere with his purpose; his heart is broken. This brings sorrow, discontent and premature death. In Psalm 103, verse 15, we read: “As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.” There is some purpose greater, far more noble, in the use of the things that exist than self-pleasure. Unless man knows the purpose of the existence of all things and cooperates with the Creator in these purposes, dissatisfaction and disappointment always result. Solomon said, as stated in Ecclesiastes 5:10-17, “He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance 'with increase: this is also vanity. When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.” Certainly the accumulation of wealth and the things of this world is not man’s chief concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some believe that it is man’s chief concern to establish world-wide peace. Many well-meaning statesmen have advocated this as their purpose. We do not doubt the good motive of these men, but certainly when we understand the purpose of the Creator, all of man’s efforts toward world-wide peace must be futile. Man, for centuries, has been trying to establish peace among various peoples and nations. The reason for man’s failure is that an unseen master called Satan, the Devil, is more powerful than man and has the nations of this world under his control and man cannot do what he wishes under the present organization of society. The powerful influence of this invisible enemy is apparent everywhere. That the enemy must be restrained in order that man might make progress, is absolutely necessary. Satan’s influence upon the human race will be reviewed later in this lecture. Certainly man, through his own efforts, cannot obtain peace. Man’s chief concern at this time would therefore not be toward worldwide peace no matter how noble the desire of the peace promoters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have believed that it is man’s chief concern to develop a nice, sweet character: to be immaculately clean, to be honest with one’s fellows, to act pious and be very religious. They believe that such is all that is required to be a Christian. But this is far from the mark of being a Christian, and this is not man’s chief concern. Such practice only leads to hypocrisy. We have all of these requirements even among the heathen, who do not claim to be Christian, and they laugh at the practices of people of civilized lands who pretend to be followers of Christ. The practice of developing character centers the mind and heart upon self; it leads to selfishness. Such practice leads one away from his Creator. The Christian is called to expend self at the cost of suffering that the name of Jehovah might be magnified. Character development is far from being man’s chief concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Others hold that man’s chief concern is the eternal salvation of his soul. Some got this idea from their catechisms which they studied before becoming denominational church members. This idea is not taught in the Bible. Such an idea centers the heart and mind upon oneself and is born of selfishness. As one becomes selfish he will be chiefly concerned about self, which is the very thing that the enemy would have him do if he does not worship the enemy himself. This keeps the mind of the person away from the true God. The master hand back of this idea and all ideas that center the mind upon self as of the greatest importance is that of the Devil himself. Certainly there is something of greater importance to man than the selfish interests of his own soul. Seeing then that man is in error concerning the things that gratify his selfish motives, and noting that he is under the influence of a powerful enemy that is turning him away from the true God and His righteousness, we may ask, What is man’s chief concern ? How will he obtain happiness here on earth? These questions are of vital importance to each individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to answer these questions, it is necessary for us to know the relationship of man to his Creator. In Genesis 2:7 we read: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” Man must recognize that he is a created person, and that he was placed here for a purpose. To know that purpose and act in accordance therewith brings joy in this life, and in the life to come eternal happiness. The Creator states definitely man’s purpose. In Isaiah 43:7 Jehovah speaks these words: “I have created him [my servant] for my glory.” Very few people on earth today are a glory and praise to Jehovah; almost all of them are either ignorant oi’ ashamed of Him. However, with assurance, the hopeful promise is given that the people in the near future, when God’s government is established in the earth, shall praise Jehovah with gladness. In Psalm 67:3,4 we read: “Let the people praise thee, </span><span class="font6">0 </span><span class="font5">God; let all the people praise thee. </span><span class="font6">0 </span><span class="font5">let the nations be glad, and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.” In order to be a praise to the Lord man must reverence his Maker and seek counsel from the Most High. In Psalm 111:10 we find these words: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Certainly if one wishes guidance and counsel as to what is right, he wisely seeks information from one who has greater capacity in these things than himself. In Isaiah 55: 9 Jehovah says, “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is God's purpose today for those who have faith in Him to be His witnesses. His faithful representatives today are proclaiming that Jehovah is the true God; that Christ Jesus is not only man’s Redeemer and God’s Son, but the appointed King in the new kingdom; and that Jehovah’s kingdom or government will shortly bless all the obedient of mankind with health, peace, happiness, and life everlasting. The Kingdom, and nothing but the Kingdom, will bring the solution of all of man’s problems. Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.” Wars will cease in the Kingdom ; man will learn how to eat and drink; man will know what to say and do to be a praise to Jehovah; sickness will vanish; death will be wiped out. God’s kingdom is the first thing; all other things are secondary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, &quot;we may ask, how was man turned aside from the worship of the true God? Why did not man fulfill the purpose here on earth of doing Jehovah’s will? The Bible definitely ansivers these questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time that Adam was placed in the garden of Eden, a spirit creature called Lucifer, a trusted agent of Jehovah, was given charge of the first pair. Lucifer was told to look after the welfare of the human race and keep them in the course of righteousness. Had Lucifer done this, the human family might have been spared much suffering and death. But Lucifer craved the worship of man for himself. He saw that man was put here for the express purpose of honoring the Creator. He knew that this honor and praise brought joy to the Maker of man. Lucifer was ambitious. He wanted man to worship him. His purpose at that time was, and ever has been, to turn man away from Jehovah and that which is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer conceived the idea of making Jehovah out a liar. While it was true that the Creator had stated that death was the punishment for disobedience, Lucifer told Eve, ‘Thou shalt not surely die.’ Eve related this to Adam and both were led into sin. The purpose of this lie was to turn the minds of both Adam and Eve away from their Creator. It was also the purpose of the wicked one to encourage this human pair to put greater confidence in him. From that time until this, the enemy has ever used his agents to persecute every individual w<sup>r</sup>ho has taken his stand on the side of the Lord Jehovah. Furthermore, it will be noted that the doctrine of inherent immortality has been the basis of every false religion that tends to draw mankind away from an understanding of the Bible. Lucifer’s name was changed to that of Serpent, which means “deceiver”, because he has led man into error and against his Maker, while posing as the representative of Jehovah. He is also known as the Devil, which means “slanderer”, because he has blasphemed the name of God, the Creator, and has thus turned the minds of the people away from the true God. He is known, furthermore, by the term “adversary”, which means ‘the one who opposes the course of righteousness’. Thus he has opposed everyone who has lived godly in Christ Jesus. The name Dragon is also an appellation of the wicked one. The term “dragon” means “devourer”; and he seeks to destroy all those who are approved by Jehovah. Satan, being an invisible spirit creature and much more powerful than man, operates upon the minds of human creatures. The Bible has it that “the whole world Heth in [the wicked one]”; in 2 Corinthians 4:4, that Satan “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them”. He prevents everybody from coming to a knowledge of the truth except those who whole-heartedly desire to do the will of God. We see, therefore, that the wisest and most influential men according to this world are under the strong delusion of the adversary, the Devil, whether they know it or not, and no matter how noble the causes may be which they espouse, the adversary has kept such away from the chief concern of man. The adversary is responsible for many humanitarian projects which seem good but yet turn the minds of men away from the main purpose of existence. He has undoubtedly encouraged the prohibition issue in civilized nations, the international peace movements, the League of Nations, the Interchurch World Movement, and many o diet like projects. Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.” Satan has set. up many substitutes for the righteous kingdom of God, for the church of Jehovah, and for the Bible, which is the Word of Truth. He has mistaught, misrepresented and blasphemed the name of Jehovah. Satan has used every means under the sun to turn the heart and mind of man away from his Maker. He has used to this end many things which were made for the blessing of mankind and for the glory of God. He has induced man to set his affections upon the things of this world for a selfish purpose rather than to use them for the glory of the Lord. He has set the hearts of men upon riches, and they have bent their efforts in the gathering of gold rather than turning their energies to the glory of God, and man has met sorrow when his riches were suddenly snatched from his hands. He has caused man to build houses, cathedrals and palaces only to be razed in ruins, causing much sorrow. He has caused men to worship one another as heroes rather than worship the Mighty One of the universe. He has caused men to set wives, children, sweethearts and friends in higher esteem than God, and has as a result brought men to sorrow and grief in the loss of their dear ones. The difficulty with man has been, not in the possession of these things, but in the wrong use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil has mistaught the people concerning the love of God. He has put it into the minds of people and caused it to be printed in books that the Almighty is a fiend designing to eternally torment the majority of the human family. Teaching that man possesses an immortal soul, he has made people believe that it is not necessary to believe in a God or to have faith in a resurrection of the dead. The enemy has taught that men evolved from a micro-organism; that man evolved upward; that man did not fall into disobedience and as a result need a redeemer. In Psalm 74:18 we read: “Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, 0 Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.” The psalmist, realizing that the enemy, Satan, has mistaught the people, and speaking prophetically of the present time, when the creeds of error are widespread throughout the earth, says, in the tenth verse of the same psalm, “0 God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we have the Scriptural evidence and the physical facts that man was led away from the Avorship of the true God by the enemy Satan. The enemy is much more powerful than man, and man by his own efforts cannot overcome the influence of Satan. The enemy operates upon the minds of all people who are not protected by the power of Jehovah, and Satan moulds the thoughts and desires of men to suit his purpose. Thus all but a remnant of mankind have been led away from man’s chief concern. This remnant have faith in God; they have one object, the doing of Jehovah’s will; they are incessant in declaring that Jehovah is the true God, and that God’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the human race is in a desperate condition under the oppressive influence of the enemy Satan, we may ask, How will Jehovah relieve mankind? How will man be brought to realize his chief concern and cooperate with his Creator? The Bible answers these questions. Jehovah has promised a kingdom, a real government. In this kingdom the enemy is forcibly replaced by Christ Jesus and His faithful little band of followers, who will be the invisible rulers of mankind. Jesus said (Luke 12:32), “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” In Revelation 20:6 we read that those who have part in the first resurrection will reign with Christ a thousand years. It will be their work to give man a knowledge of the truth, that man might again know his chief concern, to cooperate with Jehovah to the praise of His name. The obedient of mankind will be given health, peace, joy, and everlasting life, on earth. The dead will return and great joy will fill the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the reign of Christ, Satan the enemy will be restrained so that the people will be free to worship and serve the great Jehovah. In Revelation 20:1-3 we read that an angel “laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled”. It will be a great relief to all peoples to be free from deception: they will be able to think right, act right, and be a praise to their Maker. For more than six thousand years the enemy Satan has spread a veil over the minds of the people. A veil is something that obscures the light. This veil whereby the people have been held in ignorance concerning the truth will be removed. The Lord tells us in Isaiah 25:7-9 that “lie will destroy in this mountain [kingdom] the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is tire Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AVe have noted that man’s chief concern is to glorify his Creator; that Satan, the enemy, has been responsible for turning the people away from Jehovah; that the enemy has blinded the minds of the people to the truth and has set the hearts of mankind upon everything else than Jehovah and His truth; that God’s kingdom will restrain the wicked one, remove the veil that has obscured the light of truth; and that man will again come info his realm of chief concern. That will be a blessed day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing then that the Lord has made provision for mankind to be restored to Him, and that man’s chief concern is to cooperate with and praise the great Jehovah, what is the wise course for one now to pursue in order to be pleasing to the Lord? We suggest that you turn your whole heart and being to the Lord and gladly consent to do His will. Provision has been made for those who desire to know the Lord’s work at this time. A little band of the Lord’s representatives are offering the people literature that explains the life-giving truths. Let the people study concerning the Lord’s way and then themselves tell others of God’s gracious provision in His kingdom. Even now it is possible under the protection and by the grace of Jehovah to engage in the greatest of all work, to be witnesses unto the Most High. “Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding tho people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as tho fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible &quot;Word, of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that ho might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting fiom amongst men the members of his chuieh, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately bo glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it is the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that tho kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thia gospel of the kingdom must be preached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Lord has been pleased to reveal to his people that a witness must be given regarding his purpose to vindicate his name and establish a kingdom of righteousness upon the earth and that this must be done speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with this expressed will of Jehovah the Society has arranged the midwinter service week commencing January 31 and ending February 8. We know that all the anointed will rejoice in this privilege of honoring the name of Jehovah. By that time tho new 1931 prices will be in effect; and with the substantial reduction made in all the bound books, many homes will be able to take the message in that form that could not do so before. The new </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font4"> radio programs will have been on the air over a month and will have coveicd largo sections of the country which were never covered befoio by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font4"> program. The Lord showed his approval on this branch of the service by enabling his people to have 152 stations participate in its inauguration. Undoubtedly the Lord’s object in this was to prepare the field for the workers. Let each one recognize, therefore, that the Lord is going on before and that this midwinter drive will be a wonderful opportunity to ‘ ‘ speed ’ ’ the work of magnifying the name of Jehovah.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark10"></a>PRESERVATION OF THE UNSELFISH</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah preserveth all them who love him.”—Ps.145: 20, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is just; therefore he is always right and righteous. There is no exception to this rule. This fact once firmly fixed in the mind of the creature, he is better equipped to steadfastly maintain his integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is wise, and could never make a mistake. Knowing this fact enables the creature to learn wisdom. Jehovah is unselfish; therefore he is love. Knowing this fact enables the creature to love. Jehovah is the source of all life and has unselfishly made provision for his creatures to have life. Because of his unselfishness he made provision for them to have life through his beloved Son Christ Jesus. There is no other way of getting life everlasting. Those who do not get life in that way must perish. Knowing this fact enables the creature to look to God, through Christ, and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah is all-powerful and his power is always exercised for good. He is the great Preserver who has made provision for the preservation of his creatures who comply with his unchangeable rules. The sum total of the rules of Jehovah is love; “therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. ’ ’ (Rom. 13:10) Knowledge of this fact discloses the vital necessity of ascertaining what is love. Those who love God he will protect and save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Those who receive benefits from the Bible are chiefly the creatures on earth who have been called to the kingdom and who have responded joyfully to that call. These are the ones who first learn the reason why God has made and announced the rule that he will preserve all who love him. That reason is summed up in these words, to wit: For the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name. The salvation and preservation of his creatures is a secondary matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> God created the earth for man and then made man to inhabit the earth. There was at least an implied agreement or covenant that man must ever be obedient to God. Such was the condition by which man would continue to live everlastingly. God always faithfully performs his covenant. If man should keep inviolate his side of the covenant, then the worship by the creature would always be given to the Creator. Lucifer coveted this worship for himself; hence he set about to induce man to break the covenant Doing this, Lucifer (who is now called Satan) challenged God to put a creature on earth who would steadfastly hold his integrity when put to the test. Satan therefore put in issue the word and power of God and which of course involved the name of Jehovah. In addition thereto Satan plainly told Eve that God is a liar. From then till now the question at issue was and is, Who tells the truth, and who is a liar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>a</sup> If God fails to put a creature on the earth who will constantly maintain his integrity, then the issue must be decided against Jehovah. If God puts a creature or creatures on the earth who under all conditions hold fast their integrity, then the issue is decided against Satan and Satan is proved a liar and God’s words are proven true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The all-powerful God could create a creature in such manner that he would be compelled to obey whether he tried to do so or not; but that would not vindicate God’s name, because the freedom of action of the creature would be ignored and the opportunity of Satan to show his lawlessness would be limited. The supreme power of God would thus be demonstrated, but the fact would remain that the creature had not maintained his own integrity. God lays down the rule that love must be the inducing cause for the creature to hold fast his integrity and that all who are thus moved to action and faithfulness he will preserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jesus championed the word and name of Jehovah. It is written of him that ‘he was the delight of his Father’; therefore he must have always loved his Father and was unselfishly moved to action to the honor of his Father. (Prov. 8:30) Jesus was willing and glad to be changed from spirit to human, and as. a perfect man on earth proved that his Father’s word is true and that his name is worthy of everlasting praise. That he voluntarily submitted himself to his Father to this end, and was not compelled to do so, is shown by the words written of and concerning Jesus, to wit: ‘ ‘ Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” (Ps. 45:7) “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.”—Ps, 40: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• Because of his unselfish devotion to righteousness, and his hatred of wickedness or lawlessness, Jesus was appointed by Jehovah to the highest position in the universal organization of God. He was entrusted with the task of proving that man can hold fast his integrity to God under the most severe test, and in this he fully succeeded. His faithfulness unto death provided the ransom price for fallen man, and his exaltation to heaven opened the way for other creatures to follow in his steps; but this was not the moving cause on his part. That which moved Jesus to the course of action taken by him was his love for Jehovah, and that which moved Jehovah to preserve and exalt Jesus was pure unselfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TRUTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> When Jesus began his part of the covenant Jehovah had made with him he opened his campaign of preaching the truth. What is truth? Whatsoever Jehovah says is truth. Jesus gave answer when he said: “Thy word is truth.’’ (John 17:17) Whatsoever Satan or any other creature says contradictory to the word of God is a lie. Jesus said that Satan was a liar from the beginning and there was no truth in him. (John 8:44) Therefore Jesus put himself squarely on Jehovah’s side of the great question at issue and defied Satan the liar and all of the agencies he uses. The truth, therefore, is the great issue, because this involves the word and name of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Seeing the issue and the position Jesus took and maintained, we can easily see why he said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.’’ (John 7:16) Otherwise stated, the truth is what God says; the truth is not the product of man. If any man has the truth and speaks it he got it from God. To give man honor for the truth is to push God into the corner. Furthermore Jesus said: “He [my Father] that sent me is true.’’ “The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.”—John 8:26; 14: 24.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jesus continued to impress upon his hearers that Jehovah his Father always speaks the truth and that he, Jesus, had come to the earth to bear witness to the truth. He made this the most important part of his mission. He emphasized this when he said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” (John 18: 37) No one could possibly have any doubt as to where Jesus stood. He was for the truth under all conditions, and therefore always on the side of his Father; and he was there because he loved his Father.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The positive course of righteousness taken by Jesus drew upon his head the constant fire of the enemy Satan. That, however, did not at all deter Jesus from continuing in the way of righteousness and in his unqualified devotion to Jehovah. He fearlessly and boldly continued to preach the truth to those who would hear. Throughout the entire period of his ministry he was persecuted by Satan, and Satan at all times sought to kill Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Satan turned the people of Israel against Jesus; hence it is written that he came to his own and his own received him not. The leaders of Israel, who claimed to be servants of God, were employed by Satan to persecute Jesus even unto death. He saw the people about him defaming his Father’s name and aligning themselves on the side of Satan the liar, and for this reason Jesus suffered much. He was driven from the synagogues and denounced in the public places, haled into the courts and falsely charged with crime, unjustly convicted and wickedly put to death. God could have prevented him from thus suffering, to be sure. He could have restrained the forces of wickedness about him, but the fact that he did not do so is proof that God would permit Satan to prove his threat and challenge and would afford Jesus the opportunity to prove that men can maintain their integrity under all conditions and that Satan is a liar and God is true.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> What was the inducing cause or motive for Jesus’ holding fast his integrity under these most severe trials? Was it that he might be rewarded with the high place of King and Chief in God’s great organization? That was not it at all. It was because he loved his Father. He loved righteousness and hated wickedness, and his Fathei’ stood and forever stands for righteousness. The wicked one had put at issue his Father’s word and name, and Jesus delighted to take his stand on the side of his righteous Father. God’s righteous law was written in his heart and he delighted in doing that which would honor his Father's name. (Ps. 40:8) That he did not endure persecution and suffering that he might receive some new glory is conclusively proven by his words at the end: “Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.” (John 17: 5) To this the apostle adds concerning Jesus: ‘ ‘ Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.” The joy set before Jesus was the fact that some day in God’s due time he would have an opportunity to vindicate his Father’s word and name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jesus did not spend three and a half years in his ministry to develop a character. That time was allotted to him and spent by him to proclaim his Father’s word of truth and to prove that his Father is right and his name worthy of all praise, and in these he was prompted to act because of his unselfish devotion to his Father. Because of the love of Jesus for his Father, and the proof of that unselfishness by faithful devotion under the most severe test, God preserved his existence and raised him up to the highest position in his organization and gave him a name above all creation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHERS INVOLVED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> These things are here stated concerning Jesus because they clearly define the rule that Jehovah has made to govern his creatures who shall receive his favor and hold it. The nation of Israel had the favor of God, but because of selfishness and unfaithfulness, all, with the exception of a few, fell away to the enemy. With the little remnant of Israel the Lord organized his church, and caused his faithful disciples to proclaim the truth to others that they might take their stand on the side of righteousness. From Pentecost forward men heard the message of truth and many eame to the Lord. The inducing cause of their coming was not the same with all. The writings of the apostles show that selfishness was manifested in the early ehurch and that the selfish walked for a while in the light and then fell away. A smaller number held fast together and steadfastly held their integrity. What was the motive that induced these men to remain faithful and true? The apostle answers: “The love of Christ [the anointed] constraineth us.’’ (2 Cor. 5:14) Not the love </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font5"> Christ, but the love </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> Christ or love similar to that of Christ, was the inducing cause and is yet the inducing cause for one to hold fast his integrity and to firmly remain on the Lord’s side. The love of Christ is an unselfish devotion to God, and that like devotion the apostle says was then holding his brethren on the Lord’s side. That must be true with reference to all who remain faithful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> From the passing of the apostles from the earthly stage of action until the manifestation of the second presence of Christ there must have been a small number who were really devoted to God. Approximately A. D. 1879 Christ Jesus began the work of preparing the way before Jehovah; and that work progressed until 1918, when the Lord suddenly came to his temple. (Mal. 3:1) In that period of time the fundamental truths were gradually restored to the faithful, and these truths were preached by them to others. Many heard the truth and embraced it gladly. The facts now made known, however, show that the major number of those who in that period of time received a mental conception of the truth received it in a selfish manner and not with a pure and unselfish motive. To such present truth was the best religion about which they had ever heard. It disclosed that God does not have a place of eternal torment and that what had been taught concerning such place of torture was wholly the Devil’s lie and that therefore neither the recipient of the truth nor any one else would have to go to such place. It was a great relief of mind to know that they would escape the so-called “tortures of hell’’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Then the heavenly prize was seen in a measure and many looked forward with great expectancy to being in heaven by reason of having been called to that heavenly place and responding to the call. Frequently one would remark like this: ‘If only I can get to heaven I shall be satisfied. I shall be glad to even get in by the back door.’ It is easy to see that self preservation and self blessing and honor and exaltation was the chief inducing cause or motive for such receiving and serving the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Still others were frequently heard to say: ‘How marvelous it will be to go to heaven. I am in possession of a clear knowlege of the truth and I have developed a character more nearly perfect than many others and therefore God will take me to heaven to help rule the world.’ These did not receive the love of the truth. Subsequent facts show that some in that period of time did receive the love of the truth. Their motive or moving cause to action was unselfish.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME OF JUDGMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The words of the psalmist, “Jehovah preserveth all them who love him, ’ ’ constitute the text for the year 1931 and will be more appreciated because the church now has a clearer vision of its meaning than heretofore. It is true that the text announces a universal law of Jehovah, but it is also certain that its particular application could not be until the coming of the Lord to his temple. It is then that judgment began, and that judgment must begin with those who have responded to the call to the house of God. (Ps. 11:4; 1 Pet. 4:17; Mal. 3:1-4) It is then that the “Wicked’’ is revealed and that the ‘ ‘ faithful servant ’ ’ is also made manifest. Now Jehovah, true to his promise, discloses to the faithful the former things that have come to pass in fulfilment of prophecy, and now he discloses new things unto them, and before these spring forth he makes known the meaning thereof to the faithful. (Isa. 42:9) To those whose motives are right these truths call forth more intense devotion to Jehovah and induce them to sing unto the Lord the new song of praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> What is love? Love is the full and complete expression of unselfishness. Of the Most High it is written: “God is love.’’ There is not one act of God disclosed by the Scriptures that is at all selfish. Everything he does is unselfishly done. No creature could bring any profit to Jehovah, and therefore self-gain is an impossibility as an inducing cause of action with Jehovah. The complete expression of unselfishness is therefore the Scriptural definition of love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The primary commandment of the law, which God gave to Israel, and which Jesus restated, is, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.’’ (Matt. 22:37) The “heart” is that part of the creature wherein resides the motive or inducing cause for action; hence it is said to be the seat of love and affection. The “soul” stands for the entire creature, every part thereof; while the “mind” is that part of a creature used to search out the truth of the Scriptures and to consider this together with the facts, arrive at a conclusion, and ascertain the will of God. All these faculties must be devoted to Jehovah by one who loves him. The unselfish devotion to God leads the creature to joyfully do the will of Jehovah, having in mind that it is his duty and privilege thus to honor the great Creator, from whom all good things proceed. Love is not a sentimentality nor an emotion, but is an unfaltering and unselfish devotion of the creature to the Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> The fact that God’s primary commandment is that his creature shall love him, does not this show that God is selfish? may be asked. Not in the slightest. God gave life to man with the privilege of retaining it upon condition of full obedience. Satan Used his power to induce man to give his allegiance and devotion and honor to Satan, thus turning man away from God and thereby depriving man of life and the right thereto. God is the only source of life. For man’s own good, therefore, God commanded man to love him, that man might save himself from the wicked one and from the fate of the wicked. Satan is man’s worst enemy even as he is God’s enemy. God is man’s best friend and therefore it is for man’s welfare that he devotes himself unselfishly to God. Obedience to the first great commandment means the full, complete and unselfish devotion of the creature to his best friend, and results in his eternal welfare, happiness and life. The commandment was therefore wholly unselfishly given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> ‘ ‘ Sanctification ’ ’ means to be wholly and completely set aside or apart for a specific purpose. The prayer of Jesus in behalf of his eleven faithful disciples was: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) The petition of Jesus was that these faithful men should be wholly and completely devoted to God and his service, and that this should be done by and through the truth. That would mean that they must receive a knowledge or mental conception of the truth and that in addition thereto they must receive the love of the truth. This would be proven by their full and complete devotion to the truth because the truth is God’s Word. That would mean that they would be wholly on God’s side because everything he says is the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The Apostle Paul, addressing the church, speaks of those who come into judgment in the last days because they received not the love of the truth. (2 Thess. 2:10) What is meant by receiving the love of the truth? Clearly the meaning is that one receives the truth and devotes himself wholly and unselfishly to the truth because the truth honors, magnifies and vindicates God’s word and name. It follows, then, that anyone who receives a knowledge of the truth and who uses that knowledge for a selfish purpose does not receive the love of the truth. The one who receives the love of the truth is sanctified by the truth. The others are not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The Scriptures disclose God’s purpose to redeem and deliver mankind through the sacrificial blood of his beloved Son; also to select a small number from amongst men who willingly and joyfully suffer with Christ Jesus and who shall reign with him; and that Christ Jesus and these faithful ones with him shall constitute the “elect servant” of God, his royal house, the ready instrument to carry out God’s future purposes. This is a statement of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> But why should God carry his purpose into action by this means? Many answer, The reason is, to keep the Devil from getting mankind, and that God wants to save as many as possible and take them to heaven and to save others on the earth. Then, say they, we see that God is calling some to the high or heavenly place and that by responding to that call one may be taken to heaven and assist in ruling and restoring the world. Those who see no further than this do not appreciate God’s primary purpose in the redemption and blessing of the human race.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> The primary purpose of God is to decide the great issue to the vindication of his own word and name and for the benefit of creation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> The salvation of mankind and the salvation of the church, and exalting the members thereof to glory, is only secondary to the real primary purpose of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Those who are brought to a knowledge or mental understanding of the truth concerning redemption, the exaltation of the church, and the restoration of the world, as revealed in the Bible, and then embrace it that they may have some personal gain do not receive the love of the truth. Those who receive a knowledge of the truth and then unselfishly devote themselves to God that they might have some small part in vindicating his name and word receive not only the truth, but also the love of the truth. These love God because everything he says is truth. They love righteousness and hate lawlessness because God is wholly righteous, while Satan is iniquitous, wholly wicked, and everything he says is a lie.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Those who receive the love of the truth take their firm stand on the side of God regardless of what personal honor and glory may come to them. Such are sanctified by the truth. As Jesus was content to be restored to his former glory, so his faithful followers are content to have whatsoever place God may see fit to give them. Their great objective is to be on the side of the Lord, to honor and magnify his name and to do that which is pleasing to him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JOY OF THE LORD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> When the Lord appeared at his temple for judgment he found two separate and distinct classes, both of which had received a knowledge of the truth, and only one of which had received the love of the truth. The selfish class had been looking forward to the coming of the Lord and their own exaltation to heavenly glory. They being selfish, their love of self was more than their love to magnify Jehovah’s word and name. Since coming to a knowledge of the truth they had looked forward particularly to being with the Lord and reigning with him and enjoying the great distinction and honor, and this hope they expected to be consummated in 1914. The year 1914 came and passed, and 1918 came, and still their expected glory had not materialized. This class the Lord collectively designates in his Word as the “evil servant” who ‘says in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming’. This class in mind concluded that the Lord has delayed his coming to take them to heaven, and they became sour and began to smite their brethren who were born of the same mother covenant. Had this class, called the “evil servant”, received the love of the truth a different attitude would have been manifested, and instead of looking for some selfish glorification they would have been waiting upon the Lord and looking after the kingdom interests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The other class the Lord collectively designates as “a faithful and wise servant”, and whom upon coming for examination he finds to be doing what they can to magnify the Lord’s word and name. Those going to make up this class have received the love of the truth and are humbly doing what they can to look after the kingdom interests, and their desire is to see the name of God exalted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> The words of Jesus spoken as a prophecy, and which apply at the time of his coming to the temple, and now addressed to the ones who received the love of the truth, are these:‘You have been faithful over a few things [such as you saw to do], I will make you ruler over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.’ The Lord expresses his pleasure in these and brings them under the robe of righteousness (thereby denoting their approval) and into the temple, and reveals to them the meaning of his words, “the joy of thy lord.” Only those who have received the love of the truth enter into the joy of the Lord and can appreciate the meaning thereof. If one is really in the joy of the Lord he loves God; and if he continues in that attitude, faithful to the end, God will preserve him according to his promise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Someone who is in the colporteur service remarks: ‘I find such great joy in going from house to house with the books and placing them in the hands of the people because I know that this knowledge will bring relief and benefit to the people; therefore I know I am in the joy of the Lord. ’ This is a misconception of what constitutes “the joy of the Lord”. The one who would thus remark would show that he has a good feeling arising from the fact that he is doing good to others, and he is doing good; but that does not constitute “the joy of the Lord”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> Jesus delighted to do his Father’s will, which included the preaching of the truth. But that was not “the joy that was set before him”. Furthermore, when Jesus was diligently preaching the truth he was the object of all manner of persecution because he did so preach the truth. He was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief”. He was accused of all manner of crime, abused and maligned, and yet he went right ahead preaching the truth, at the same time knowing that soon he must die in the most ignominious manner. Because of the joy set before him, however, he refused to give consideration to the sufferings that he must endure upon the cross.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> The joy set before Jesus was this: He knew that some day he would have the great privilege of seeing the issue decided in favor of Jehovah his Father and that that issue thus decided would vindicate the word and name of God. He was willing to wade through fire and death to accomplish that end. After his resurrection and ascension into heaven, without a doubt he was ready to proceed at once to oust Satan, and to settle the matter at issue before all creation. Jehovah said to him, as it is written: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool”; and in obedience to his Father’s will he did that very thing.—Heb. 10:12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> In 1914 God set his beloved Son upon his throne and said to him: Now the time has come for action; now “rule thou in the midst of thine enemies”. (Ps. 2: 6; 110:1, 2) Then the fight in heaven began; and the victory was with Christ Jesus. The joy set before him, and therefore the joy of the Lord, had then really come, because he then actively engaged in putting down Satan and vindicating his Father’s name. When Jesus came to the temple and gathered the faithful together unto himself he invited them to “enter into the joy of thy lord”. It is therefore clearly seen that the joy of the Lord in which the faithful now participate and will continue to participate is the fact that Jehovah’s word and name shall be vindicated and that they shall have a part therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> Another colporteur says: ‘ I suffer very much when I go out to give the testimony by carrying the message from house to house. I am anxious to go and be a witness to the name and word of my God, but I am so apprehensive and timid that when someone speaks unkindly to me I suffer very much. I have wondered many times if this is an evidence that I am not anointed and that I am not pleasing to the Lord.’ Such timidity and mental suffering is no evidence that one has not received the anointing of the Lord. Satan and his agencies caused great suffering to Jesus, and the body members must expect the same thing. Now Satan and his organization causes the arrest, imprisonment and persecution of some of the Lord’s faithful witnesses. These witnesses are denounced as the offscour-ing of the world and all manner of abuse is heaped upon them from time to time. But still they go straight forward in doing the work the Lord has given them to do, fully realizing the fact that, in so doing, in the end they will have some part in the vindication of God’s word and name, and this causes rejoicing on their part. That is one of the best evidences that they are in the “joy of the Lord”, and have received the anointing of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> One may be weeping tears of bitterness by reason of persecution and ill treatment and slander heaped upon him by the &quot;evil servant” class, and others of Satan’s agents, and still not slack the hand in delivering the testimony that has been committed to him. Doing this because he loves God and because he thus has a part in the vindication of God’s name proves it is unselfish and is strong evidence that he is in the joy of the Lord. Because one loves righteousness and hates lawlessness, and because he is determined to have some part in giving honor to God’s name, he goes on through the storm of persecution and slander and at the same time is conscious of an inward joy that his course of action is right and lawful and that he is on the Lord’s side, and such is proof that one is really in the joy of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The joy of the Lord is induced by love for God. These faithful ones see that soon the great battle of the day of God Almighty will be fought and that it is the will of God that before then testimony shall be given, and they delight to have a part therein at and cost. Their course of action is prompted by love for God, and they have therefore received the love of the truth. With some of these faithful ones every earthly tie has been severed, and all of them, like the Master, are hated by every nation under Satan’s control, and yet there is present in the heart of each a conscious joy that the Lord Jesus Christ is leading them to certain and complete victory in the vindication of Jehovah and to his glory and honor. Moved by this, they go on. They have received the love of the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROOF OF LOVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The promise of God is to those who love him. How may one know that he loves God? The answer is, by keeping the commandments of the Lord and doing so unselfishly and delighting in the opportunity of so doing at the cost of self-abasement. &quot;For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and bis commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font5"> It is not sufficient to merely say, ‘I love God.’ But those in fact love him who keep his commandments joyfully and thereby prove their love for him and his cause and his truth. &quot;If ye love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”—John 14:15, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Regardless of what anyone may say about loving God, he who does not joyfully keep God’s commandments proves he does not love him. The anointed ones now see that the great issue is soon to be determiiied and that, Satan, with his organization, being destroyed, the name of Jehovah will be vindicated. Plainly these see that the commandments of God are: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God. The kingdom of heaven is at hand; go and tell this message to the people. This gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the nations as a witness before the end. The testimony of Chiist has been committed to you; be faithful in telling it.’ (Isa. 43:10-12; 6:9-12; Matt. 24:14; Rev. 12:17) Those who arc moved by an unselfish devotion to God to obey these commandments prove their love for Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WICKED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> No one can be wicked until he has received some knowledge of the truth. Using that knowledge for selfish purposes and then persecuting those who are striving to honor God’s name is proof of wickedness. The wicked do not keep God’s commandments and do not love God. (John 14:24) They receive the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">knowlcdgt </span><span class="font5">but not the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> of the truth. Having received the truth into a selfish heart such use the truth in a selfish manner, &quot;and on this account God will send to them an energy of delusion, to their believing the falsehood; in order that all those may be judged who believed not the truth, but approved the iniquity.” (2 Thess. 2:11, 12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span><span class="font5">) Selfishly they have in substance said to their brethren: ‘We are more holy than others; we are developing character, and we are the ones who shall rule with Jesus in the kingdom. ’ These are saying, &quot;Lord, Lord,” but they are not doing his will by keeping his commandments. Thus the apostle states that they pursue a lawless course, ignoring and repudiating the commandments of God. They never receive the love of the truth, have never been in the joy of the Lord, and are not concerned about the vindication of his word and name. They are blind to the issue. They love lawlessness rather than righteousness, and the final decree of Jehovah concerning such is: &quot;All the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145:20, 2 Thess. 1:8; 2:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESERVATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup>&quot; Preservation ” means to hedge about with a secure fence or shield; to guard, protect and finally save. It means to keep in a place of security. God has promised to preserve all who love him, and this he is certain to do. This does not mean, however, that God will spare his children from slander, abuse and persecution. As the Master suffered much tribulation it shall be so with his faithful body members. Jehovah preserved the life of Jesus, raised him out of death, and exalted him to glory, because of his loving devotion by which he proved his faithfulness. He will do likewise for the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. The enemy now directs his attack against the remnant because to the remnant has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ and they are telling it in obedience to his commandments. (Rev. 12:17) That means a fight to the very end. Those who love God need have no fear of being the losers in that fight, because to such Jehovah says: “Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.”—Ps. 91:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4T</sup> It has pleased Jehovah by and through the ministry of his beloved Son to open the book called The Revelation, that the faithful may see what is to be speedily done. This suggests that the great battle of the day of God Almighty draws near. Of course we do not know how soon, but it behooves every one of the anointed to be on the alert and do joyfully the part assigned to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The opening of the book of Revelation will, of possible, increase the anger of Satan and his agents against the anointed. “The man of sin” will be more determined than ever to resist the onward march of the truth. The delusion of that class will cause them to become even more vituperative and reckless. On the other side, the opening of Revelation fires with greater zeal those who love God. More determined than ever are they to give the testimony as he commands Amidst the storm of slander and persecution, and against the increased opposition from the enemy, the remnant marches on. Some are timid and apprehensive, but all are singing the praises of Jehovah with an in creased inward joy. They love God and are marching-to Armageddon, and they know that victory is sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The year text is appropriate to the time, and its selection was doubtless directed by the Lord. Because of the vicious attacks of the enemy, there is a greater necessity for the remnant to be fortified. Without the strength of the Lord they could not stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> Jehovah shows his strength now in behalf of them whose hearts are perfect toward him. (2 Chron. 16:9) Such are they who love God and whose love is proven by joyfully keeping his commandments. It is absolutely certain that none of the consecrated can maintain a pure heart and prove his love for God without engaging in the Lord’s service as opportunity affords, because his commandment is to preach this gospel. The remnant, being wholly devoted to God, are unwaveringly held on the course of righteousness and steadfastly continue to be faithful. Thus proceeding lawfully in delivering the testimony, thereby proof will be given of their entire love and devotion to God. Instead of being terrified by the onslaught of the enemy they will continue to sing the new song of deliverance because they hear the voice of the Lord saying to them: “Jehovah preserveth all them who love him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Salvation is an unspeakable gift from God to his creatures, but the triumph of the truth is of far greater importance. Let it be kept in mind that those who will partake of the great salvation must prove their love for God, and this they can do only by joyfully obeying his commandments. The integrity of such must now be shown. The remnant has received the truth and the love of the truth and now must bear the life-giving and life-sustaining fruits of the Lord before the nations as a testimony to his majesty, truthfulness and righteousness. In this conflict the Lord’s promise to the faithful remnant is: “His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. . . . There shall no evil befall thee.” Thus holding fast their integrity the remnant shall see the triumph of the truth and the everlasting vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a><a name="bookmark12"></a>PREPARING FOR WAR</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HE peoples of the world today are in great distress mentally, financially, morally and physically. They know not the reason nor what is the remedy. They sense some great calamity approaching but know not what it means. The thoughtful man has no desire or purpose to add to their burdens, but it is his duty to tell the truth to the people. Such is the commandment of God’s Word, and therefore it is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the atmospheric conditions give evidence of an approaching storm it is the duty of the weather bureau to give warning to the people for their selfprotection. If one knows that a great crisis is approaching that involves the whole world and all the nations of the earth, it is one’s solemn duty to pass that information on to the people that they may take such course as may be deemed for their best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible contains the Word of truth written especially for the instruction of the lovers of righteousness who are on the earth at this particular time. The prophecy of the Bible, together with the physical facts now well known, show beyond all question of doubt that the greatest tribulation that ever came upon the nations of the world is now just ahead. The period of time in .which we are now living is designated in the Scriptures as “the day of his preparation” because it is the time in which preparation is made for the greatest warfare of all time. It is to be a war between the seen and the unseen powers of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God through his prophet Nahum describes that preparation in these words: “He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face; keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet; the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways; they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. He shall recount his worthies; they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. ’ ’—Nah. 2:1, 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These dark sayings of God’s prophet could not be understood in times past, but are now understandable because it is God’s due time and because he has caused the coming to pass of physical facts showing that the prophecy is in course of fulfilment. This prophecy means the preparation for the great battle of Armageddon; but before explaining it in detail the Word of God by another prophet concerning the preparation for war is first briefly considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sixty centuries ago Satan the enemy of God and man defied Jehovah to put men on earth who would remain true and steadfast and righteous unto God when put to the severe test. That defiance put at issue before all creation of the entire universe the question of Jehovah’s supremacy or whether or not he could do what he says. In order to for ever settle the matter and to settle it right and beyond all dispute Jehovah has permitted Satan to go his limit and do his worst in his attempt to carry out that wicked defiance. Jehovah declared from the beginning that the day of reckoning would come. Wickedness has prevailed so long that the majority of men have concluded that it will go on forever, but he who knows and believes God’s Word knows that wickedness will soon come to an end. Satan has budded a mighty organization, the visible part of which is the commercial and political rulers of the earth, which rule is “sanctified” and joined in by the religions of the world, and particularly so-called “organized Christianity”. The doom of that organization is sounded. Soon it shall fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is preparing for battle against the enemy. There is now no possibility of preventing that great battle. God foretold it by his prophets when he directed that the cup of his fury should be handed to all the nations. Had the teachers of “organized Christianity” stood by God’s Word and caused the people to hear the truth, the great battle upon Christendom would have been avoided. But not now! (Jer. 23:21, 22) Prophetically, God announces his decision when he directs his prophet to take the wine cup of his fury and pass it to every nation. ‘ ‘ For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. . . . And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.”—Jer. 25:15-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “wine cup” is a symbol of the potion which Jehovah has decreed shall be drunk by all the ruling powers of the earth. “Sheshach” is one of the names applied to Babylon, which means the Devil’s organization, and therefore the prophecy particularly applies to “Christendom”, so called, or “organized Christianity”. It applies, of course, to all of the Devil’s religions, but greater responsibility is upon those who have had ample opportunity to know better. While God proceeds with this preparation, he causes notice of his purpose to be delivered to the nations.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By his prophet Jehovah foretold the end of the Gentile times, the end of the world, and the beginning of the reign of Christ, and stated that it would be marked by the World War, quickly followed by famines, pestilences, distress of nations, the regathering of the Jews to Palestine, and the federation of the organizations of Christendom. The physical facts in fulfilment of this great prophecy began to come tc pass in 1914. Between that date and 1918, Christ Jesus, the great executive officer of Jehovah, ousted Satan from heaven. Next in order thereafter is the preparation for the final battle for the destruction of Satan’s organization. The evil organization that controls the nations of the earth must be destroyed before Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King, inaugurates righteousness amongst the nations of the earth. Satan is now devoting his attention to the earth, as the great Prophet foretold; and “because he knoweth that he hath but a short time”, Satan is preparing for the final battle. (Rev. 12:12; 16:14) Just when that great battle will take place is not now revealed to man; but because the preparations are being made, the indications are that it will come to pass in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Prophet Nahum had a vision concerning Nineveh, the ruling city of Assyria, and he began his prophecy by saying, “The burden of Nineveh.” The word “burden” means “an utterance of doom”. His prophecy that follows related to the day of God’s preparation for the expression of his vengeance against his enemy, and incidentally refers to Satan’s preparation also. Assyria was the Devil’s organization in which politics held sway, and at the same time the political element was ably supported by the commercial and religious elements. The fact that Nahum’s prophecy is directed against Nineveh, the capital city that ruled Assyria, is strongly significant that the day of preparation marks a period of time when, in the world organization, politics holds sway, and at the same time the political rulers are ably supported by Big Business and the religious elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conditions existing at the present time exactly fit the description of the prophecy. Just now it is the political rulers who are making peace pacts and treaties, and forming leagues, and declaring that they are going to make the world safe for democracy and a desirable place in which to live. In this they are ably supported by the commercial powers, which powers join in the cry of “Peace!” and at the same time are spending great sums of money to prepare for war. The claim is that the best way to prevent war is to prepare for war. In other words, the best way to prevent two men from killing each other is to arm each one of them with all the guns he can carry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the peace movements and war preparations the clergy and religious leaders are giving their unstinted support. These religious leaders occupy high seats at the councils held for the consideration of a world arrangement to prevent war. It is just at this time that the great political power restores temporal power to the head of the church of Rome, and a large sum of money is handed to the pope in connection therewith, which evidently the financiers had something to do with providing. All the facts show that the political rulers are in the saddle, Big Business and the preachers are in the chariot, and the entire combine is moving on to the great climax. All the facts show that Nahum’s prophecy is now in course of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the Lord tells his own that he will make an utter end to the wicked and that affliction shall not arise the second time. (Nah. 1:8-11) The prophet tells how the elements of the enemy organization are folded together like thorns and are drunk with ambition and their own schemes, but that God is preparing to destroy them like stubble. The Lord then informs his people that their day of affliction is about ended. “For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.” For the further encouragement of his people, God then tells them that the Devil’s wicked system shall be destroyed, and adds: “I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.” —Nah. 1:10-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the prophet shows Jehovah preparing for the siege of the enemy and his strongholds. The fact that God foretold through his prophet the day in which he would prepare for battle is proof that the battle will be fought. The physical facts which we now see show the fulfilment of the prophecy, and are proof also that the great battle is in the very near future. Addressing those who are of Zion, and who are watching the fulfilment of God’s prophecy, the prophet of the Lord says: “He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face.” That means that Christ Jesus, the great executive officer of Jehovah, is present and preparing the siege, which he does after casting Satan out of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another of God’s prophets describes the mighty officer of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, as the maul or war club with which he beats to pieces the enemy organization, and specifically names Babylon as that enemy. (Jer. 51:20-24) Appropriate to this same time, the Lord’s prophet says concerning the compact of the League of Nations: “Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought. ’ ’—Isa. 8: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further addressing God’s anointed concerning the preparation for the siege against the enemy, Nahum the prophet says: “Keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily [pull yourselves together firmly]. For the Lord [Jcho-vah] hath turned away [restored, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham]</span><span class="font5"> the excellency of Jacob [his people].” (Nah. 2:1, 2) God announces that his time is at hand when he will show his favor in a special manner to his anointed, and he tells them to prepare for the siege and to be of great courage. Up to this time “plunderershaveplundered” those of God’s anointed.</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> They have “emptied out” God’s people and marred their vine branches; but now henceforth and forever God will protect them and keep them night and day.—Nah. 2:2; Isa. 27:2, 3; Ps. 125:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then says the Prophet Nahum: “The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet; the chariot shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. ’ ’—Nah. 2: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words of the prophecy, now illuminated by the lightnings of Jehovah, show that they are descriptive of Almighty God’s preparation for war. It is Jehovah who lays siege to Nineveh, the Devil’s organization. Jehovah provides the shield for his mighty men. God then tells the enemy to get ready for the siege, because he is going to destroy him. He says: “Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds. . . . There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm; make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. ’ ’—Nah. 3:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s ‘mighty man’ who is commanding all his forces is the great Christ Jesus. His other “mighty men” are those who are fully and completely devoted to God as members of the army of the Lord. To Christ Jesus, the great Field Marshal, Jehovah says: “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.” (Ps. 45: 3, 4) Concerning all the members of Zion, Jehovah says: “I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones.”—Isa. 13: 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.;</span><span class="font5"> see also Zech. 10: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, another picture is given by the prophet. The mighty Christ Jesus is described as returning from the war and the question is propounded to him, “Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel?” and he replies that he has stained his raiment with the blood of the enemy. (Isa. 63:1-3) “The valiant men are in scarlet,” says the prophet; and these words show that the garments are made red, which identifies them with those who have the absolute and abiding faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as the Redeemer and Deliverer, in whose footsteps they joyfully follow. The so-called “organized Christianity” has no faith in the shed blood of Jesus, because his blood is denied as a means of salvation. It is only those who valiantly stand for the Lord that are identified by their garments of scarlet. These are given the garments of salvation when the Lord builds up Zion.—Isa. 61:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation.” The “chariots” represent the divisions of Jehovah’s militant organization. (Ezek. 1:4-26) Bearing upon this point, mention is here made of Elisha’s experience at Dothan. For the purpose of taking Elisha, his enemy the king sent “horses and chariots, and a great host, and they came by night and compassed the city about”. Elisha’s servant was terrified by the great power of the enemy, but Elisha was not at all disturbed. He held firmly to his shield of faith, the shield with which God had provided him, and then it was that the Lord disclosed that he had filled the mountains round about with horses and chariots of fire for the protection of Elisha. (2 Ki. 6:12-17) That record was made for the benefit of God’s people, and now we are “in that day” when God is making ready for the war and when the enemy, the dragon organization, would take the remnant and destroy the members thereof because doing the work foretold by Elisha; and the Lord surrounds the remnant with his fiery chariots. ‘ ‘ The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.”— Ps. 68:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the earth today there are small militant groups of the remnant of God’s organization, who are active in the service of the Lord. These are divisions of God’s organization, and are represented as his chariots; and these flash with the light of fire from the “lightning” of Jehovah, which shines upon them by and through his present King, who is now in his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, Jehovah is always fully equipped to engage his enemy in war; therefore “the day of his preparation” seems to refer more particularly to the fact that he is preparing by enlightening his own people, who are members of his organization, as to the time when the great conflict is approaching, and fortifying them to do their part which he has assigned to them. He sends the remnant forth to proclaim his praises and to advise the world of the approaching day of his vengeance, and while these faithful ones do so he enlightens them. He shields them and protects them, and puts them in proper order in his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.” What could that mean in connection with God’s preparation? It appears that God’s consecrated people arc likened unto fir trees. The prophet foretells the shaking of spiritual Israel and the protection of those who ‘shall dwell under the shadow of his wing’. These are represented as saying: “ I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.” Then adds the prophet: “Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein.”—Hos. 14:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918, judgment began at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) From that time forward there was a great shaking amongst the consecrated, and those who took the wise course God has blessed with an understanding of his Word, while others who claim consecration have been shaken down. This is in exact accord with what Paul declared would take place immediately preceding the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of God’s kingdom on earth. —Heb. 12:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The war that is impending is not the battle merely of men. It is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. God has not kept it secret and is not now proceeding in secrecy. He causes his witnesses to proclaim the facts, that even his arch-enemy and all of his organization may have an opportunity to know of his purposes. Satan is now aware of the fact that he is facing the greatest conflict of his existence. Recently he engaged in a fight with Christ Jesus in heaven and was worsted in that fight and cast out of heaven down to the earth. The Devil now has “great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time” to prepare.—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEMY’S PREPARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In keeping with his usual mode of procedure, Satan the enemy prepares for war, and he does so with great noise and boasting and at the same time keeps the people in ignorance of his purpose. Christ Jesus, God’s great Prophet, caused John to make a record of this prophecy: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. ’ ’—Rev. 16:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In substance they say: ‘The earth is ours, and we are going to fix everything to our liking; and when we get through the people will like it.’ This is but voicing the sentiment of the Devil, who says: “My river [peoples] is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” (Ezek. 29:3) The visible part of the organization makes peace pacts and boldly announces: ‘We have outlawed war and hence there will be no more war, and let the people be assured to that end.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Paris Peace Pact was pending before the United States Senate for ratification, its chief sponsor in America was prancing about like a well-groomed horse that wanted to show itself. Even moving pictures were made of his antics, and these were exhibited before the people throughout the land. At the same time the war organization was pushing the law-making body both for the ratification of the peace pact and for more battleships. The political whip was brought to bear to carry out the purposes of those in power: “The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots.”—Nah. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chariots mentioned in this last quoted verse are not the same chariots as those mentioned in verse three of the same chapter. The chariots first mentioned are outside of the city (the Devil’s organization) and are preparing to lay siege to the Devil’s organization. The chariots mentioned in verse four are in the streets or roadways inside of the city, and are therefore a part of and belong to the city which is the Devil’s organization. These chariots last mentioned are therefore the military organization and machinery of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hebrew word used to translate the word ‘ ‘ rage ’ ’ in verse four of the prophecy is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hallal,</span><span class="font5"> and means “to praise or to boast”, and is also rendered, “to show oneself foolish.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font5"> Thus the “chariots” of Satan’s organization that “rage” in the streets are the military preparations that are vainglorious and carried on in a boastful manner; and those who are doing it swell up and bellow like bullfrogs making a great noise, while praising their own greatness, and thereby seek to impress the people by appearing in the streets and exhibiting themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why all the noise in the public press and upon the screens of the moving pictures concerning war preparations? Why the great military and naval display at every national function? Why the exhibition at every moving picture show of some politician or warrior who is preparing for war? It is the war organizations and war lords raging in the streets and making themselves foolish. Why, in all the war preparations, at the canteens, in the art galleries, in the public press and in the moving pictures, is the religious element made so prominent? It is always a part of the same bombastic campaign that Satan himself is engineering, and he is blinding the men who are really engaged in it and using them as his dupes. These fraudulently say: ‘We are Christian, and we therefore represent Christendom.’ But be it noted that they do not praise God, nor his King, but they praise themselves. They arc hurrying in their preparations and boast of their power and make themselves mad and foolish before the Lord. And the preparation goes on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then adds the prophet: “They shall seem [the appearance of them is, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font5"> V.] like torches.” The word “torches” in this verse is more frequently translated “lamp”, and suggests the view that Satan’s organization-units, or his foremost agencies, will claim or appear to be as lamps lighting the way of the people, or like torches of liberty lighting the way for freedom and progress in the government of the people. It is the clergy that use their pulpits and the radio to harangue the people and to tell them of the great torches of liberty that the heroes are holding forth to light the people into a desirable condition. They are really blind guides and false prophets. God foretold exactly that the condition would exist which now does exist. “For such are false apostles [preachers and teachers], deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ [claiming to represent Christ, and hence called ‘organized Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’]. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers [the clergy] also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.”—2 Cor. 11:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then adds the prophet: “They shall run like the lightnings.” They are swift in the execution of their preparations, because Satan knows he has but a short time (Rev. 12:12), and the rulers are in distress and perplexity because of what they see approaching. —Luke 21: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who carry out Satan’s purposes are his favored ones, hence called his “worthies”, or nobles or famous ones. This is one of his schemes to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Satan keeps before the people the great heroes of his organization. In the religious organizations, in the great political meetings, in meetings of the financiers, in all of these the importance of the principal men, as examples and heroes worthy of praise, is held before the people. The metropolitan press, which is merely the tool or mouthpiece of Satan’s organization, publishes glowing accounts of the valor of the mighty officers of war, of the power and virtue of the financial giants, and of the greatness of the religious element and religious leaders. It is a mutual admiration society; and the press and the radio, the moving pictures and the artist, are all called into action to glorify the names of men, all of which keeps the minds of the people turned away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his preparation for the great battle Satan summons his nobles and the principal of his flock, and these “noble” clergymen and principal of the flock, hypocritically claiming to be Christians, hurry to obey the summons of their master, Satan, even as the prophet of God says they would do; and as they come “they stumble in their march”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Ii.</span><span class="font5"> V.) They stumble over “The Stone”, which is God’s anointed King, as the prophet foretold. They make haste to the defense of Satan’s world or organization; and in so doing they stumble and fall, even as Jesus the great Prophet foretold they would. (Matt. 21:44) “And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.” (Isa. 8:14, 15) They hasten to aid in the preparation for the assault upon God’s Anointed, but they fall. “When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.”—Ps. 27: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet says: ‘ ‘ They shall make haste to the wall thereof.” The clergy and the principal of their flocks make haste to seek the instruments available for the persecution and punishment of those of God’s people who are known as the remnant, and who are diligent in spreading among the people the truth of Jehovah. They make haste to man the bulwarks of Satan’s organization, that the hated remnant may be destroyed. But while this preparation is going on, the clergy, or “nobles”, decline to appear in the open and defend their cause. Their policy is to never enter into an open discussion with those who represent God, because that would expose their duplicity to the people. They are “mighty men of Babylon” (the religious part of the organization), and they swagger about and content themselves with boasting words, and secretly bring their influence to bear upon the political factors to torment God’s witnesses until the day the great battle will be fought.—Jer. 51: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan knows that shortly he must fight the Lord, and therefore he prepares for the conflict. His method of preparation, however, is that of darkness. By loud boasting, by exalting the virtues and achievements of men, and by putting the nations in fear of each other, he hastens the gathering of the people together for the great day of battle. He is really keeping the men of his visible organization in the dark. Satan hates the remnant of God with a deadly hatred, and he incites his nobles and the principal of the flock to attempt their destruction. Doubtless Satan is confident that he can destroy the insignificant and ‘ ‘ pestilential” group in the coming battle, but he now attempts to torment and persecute them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan would completely destroy the remnant now, were it not for the protection God furnishes his own. The prophet refers to Satan’s preparation and to his cohorts preparing for battle, and then says: “And the defence shall be prepared.” These latter words manifestly refer to the protection God furnishes to his remnant. The word rendered “defence” appears in the margin as “covering”, and is a covering or protection for those assaulting Satan's organization. Rotherham renders the text: “Yet the storming cover is prepared.” Jehovah is the covering, and his protection for his own is “in the secret place of the Most High”, under the shadow of his wing; ‘he shall cover these with his feathers, and under his wings shall they trust. ’—Ps. 91:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah sent Jonah to prophesy against the capital city of Assyria. The prophecy was given when Jonah had been delivered from the belly of the whale. The destruction of the city was deferred until the day of God’s preparation. Since Jesus Christ was raised from the dead, which was foretold by the deliverance of Jonah (Matt. 12:40), there has been given a testimony to the nations of earth; and particularly has this testimony been given since the second coming of the Lord and the resurrection of the faithful body members of Christ. During that period of time there has been a partial repentance of those who claim to be followers of Christ. Now the testimony work is about complete. The day of God’s preparation is done. War upon and destruction of Satan’s organization is now about due. As the gates of ancient Babylon were opened and the army entered and the city fell, so, as the prophet says, ‘ ‘ The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved,” and Satan’s organization shall fall.—Nah. 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The day of battle draws nigh. The day for the judgment of the nations is at hand. The Lord is in his holy temple for judgment. “Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is; and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.”—Mic. 1:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH MAGNIFIED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">desire to express my thanks and appreciation to our heavenly Father for the light, comfort and instruction which he has furnished to the faithful in the new bound books from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When it comes to speaking werds of commendation, my tongue is like the pen of a ready writer. But a few words will convey in a nutshell the reasons for my appreciation. The important thing in these volumes is that man aud his works are not glorified, but only the name and truth of Jehovah God; and that all credit for the light is given to Jehovah. How very different 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The writings of ecclesiastics religiously stick to errors of the past, or present new thoughts in line with evolution and modernism, either or both. But, unlike those bound by the creeds of men and misled by science falsely so called, in the Society’s literature new thoughts are presented and older ones discredited as fast as the light shines and the truth is unfolded in its due time, in harmony with THE WORD OF GOD. This gives me full assurance that the Society's leadership is directed by the mind of God, bringing perfect results out of imperfect human efforts which are directed by God’s holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These features, together with the evidence of wisdom, justice and love displayed by the style and expression of the writings in presenting Jehovah’s purposes, and the fitness and harmony in the interpretations presented, convince mo overwhelmingly that Jehovah is using the Society as the visible part of his organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much Christian love, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tour fellow servant in Jehovah’s organization,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arch</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> W. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Smith, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JOY IN KINGDOM WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just want to say that we shall be so happy to see you on Friday, October 31, D.V. Have just finished writing cards and mailing programs to “Judge Rutherford’s radio friends”. We mean by this that as we canvass from house to house we meet the sweetest, dearest people, who invite us into their homes, offer us chicken dinners, and show all manner of kindness to us; and they speak of Judge Rutherford as a friend. A number of them asked me either to telephone or to write them if you ever came to Pittsburgh. So now I have just finished writing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two weeks ago I met a lady who lives in North Carolina, and who was visiting a sister in Pittsburgh. This lady had never had our books to read, nor any circulars; but the knowledge she has is wonderful. She said: “I am done with all preachers; and I have learned more about my Bible since listening to Mr. Rutherford’s lectures than I ever knew in my life. I understand my Bible now.” Then she added: “I cannot praise him too much. I think he is one of the broadest-minded men I ever heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, this is one of the many experiences we have. She, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">course, got some books; and she wants me to keep in touch with her by correspondence. So if you ever go where she can hear you, she will be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">are enjoying our new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> books; and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">taking well, especially by the men. Oh, we cannot find words </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">express our joy in this kingdom work; and we love you, dear brother, for your encouraging words in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font4">for the warning against the evil servant class and everything. We say “Amen” to Brother Hemery’s letter in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font4"> God bless and keep you in the secret place of the Most High. The girls join me in sending love, and hope to see you soon in person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Excuse me for writing; but we just felt that we must say a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your sister by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Minnie Gardner, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘PRAISE TO JEHOVAH AND THE LAMB’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in Zion. Rise and shine (to Jehovah’s praise); for thy light has come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee and all his faithful anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 want to join my voice and powers in joyful praise to the great Jehovah and his beautiful, beautiful Son, for the Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to point out to his servants the things it is necessary to have done </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">speedily;</span><span class="font4"> the time is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely everything around us, and the message, shows the necessity for a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mighty work speedily.</span><span class="font4"> We have all said, “Here am I, Lord; send me.” And now we want to go on record anew, saying, “We are ready and are going by his grace and in his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">strength,”</span><span class="font4"> and keep so busy and faithful that we will not worship the ones who were used to bring us this marvelous Revelation, which God has kept in his own power until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The truth has been grand and new from the first we knew. But now what a stream, clear as crystal, flowing from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">throne,</span><span class="font4"> deeper and wider, with the trees on either side for food and the healing of the nations! This is Jehovah’s doing and is marvelous in our eyes. Praise him and his dear Son for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I know you must be happy, dear brother, seeing that our gieat and good Father’s name is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">soon</span><span class="font4"> to be vindicated. I want you to know that I am, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I do thank you for the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> 1 and 2. Words fail me when I would try to say how I do appreciate this marvelous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> from the Eternal King and his beautiful, beautiful, dear Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I want to try to show my appreciation by being more faithful and zealous as a light bearer. I do thank the Lord, too, for the wonderful articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> that have prepared us for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light:</span><span class="font4"> “The Royal House,” “Daniel,” “The Angels,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will 1 seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are praying that the Lord will comfort, cheer and keep you in his mighty work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely this is the great voice from or out of the temple of heaven </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">from the throne,</span><span class="font4"> saying, It is done; the mystery </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">finished; the Light has come. “Praise ye the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours, rejoicing in the Light of Revelation,</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Skies Pouring Down Righteousness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it.” (Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">45; 8) “The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isa. 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE Lord our God has been very generous in the way in which He has spread the waters over the face of the beautiful planet upon which we dwell. The average depth of these waters is about two miles; in places it runs to seven miles. The above scriptures reveal God’s purpose to sometime pour down the truth from the heavens and to saturate the atmosphere of the earth with it miles deep, “as the waters ... ...cover, the-sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of us have been so engrossed with the beautiful figures of speech with which the Scriptures abound that we have measurably lost sight of the fact that, in addition to being provided for the enjoyment of those who have large imaginations, they contain repeated and plainly stated announcements of the things 'which God purposes to do in the earth, which things v<sup>r</sup>e see now being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">W/.7/Before the discovery of the radio, who would have supposed that there would ever come a time in our day when Jesus’ words to His disciples would he fulfilled, “Whatsoever ye have i spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that- which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops” ? (Luke 12: 3) Yet this is exactly what the radio doos. The message of truth is spoken in the “darkness” or seclusion of the studio; it is c&quot;<sup>7</sup> spoken, in the ear (in the microphone) in the closets and it is proclaimed upon the house-iy. tops by the antennae which today, quivering | ■ with the message of the truth, are literally attached to the housetops of millions of homes in <sup>:</sup> world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prior to the discovery of the radio, who would .supposed .that the skies would literally dwu. righteousness, literally deluging a community with the message of the Kingdom, and literally causing the judgment of Babylon, the Devil’s organization, to reach unto heaven and be “lifted up even to the skies”?—Jer. 51.: 9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A Visit to WHK</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">This is not much of a story. It merely .tel Is a little, and a very little at that, about one of the more than 200 radio stations now weekly broadcasting the electrical transcriptions of Judge Rutherford, every one of which is filled to the full with “righteousness”, truth, on the most important subjects that can engage the attention of men, the great truths of the Scriptures, the gospel of the Kingdom, stated so kindly and yet so plainly and so forcefully that all who listen may readily appreciate and accept, each who will, God’s precious gift of truth which thus conies to them out of the skies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It so happens that the WHK radio station manager was on the way to the one-day service convention planned for Massillon, April 12, and a convenient opportunity was provided for learning something of what was going on there. More of this later in this article, but now we give attention to the more important general aspects of what, not only this station, but hundreds of other stations are collectively doing to fulfil the scriptures which appear at the head, of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the myriad duties entrusted to the manager of a radio station is to constantly check up radio reception of his own station and other stations wherever he happens to be; so a conscientious and capable manager is seldom avzay from a receiving set for any considerable length of time. The manager of WHK has his auto equipped with a good receiving set. and as he drives about from one place to another, fulfilling his engagements, he gives constant attention to this phase of his work from sunrise to midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like many other intelligent up-to-date-business men. M. A. Howlett, manager of WHK, is a great admirer of Judge Rutherford and listens regularly to his lectures, which at his station go on at 7:10 o’clock Sunday evening. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Waightowee</span><span class="font6"> features are on from 8:50 to 11; 00 Sunday morning and from 2: 00 to 3: 00 Sunday afternoon, and from 6: 30 to 7: 30 Sunday night; from 7: 30 to 8: 00 on the mornings of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and from 7:00 to 8:00 o’clock on Thursday evening, every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the morning of Sunday, April 12, Mr. Howlett took five of. us out in the service work at Massillon, and we all took a hand in it and placed twenty-two books and booklets, besides having the following wonderful experience in fulfilment of the scriptures heretofore cited:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Inundation from Above</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 9:45 a.m., having then been out in the work about an hour, we gathered in. the car, turned the dial to AV J AY, Cleveland, and as though the speaker were in the car, in came the opening announcement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the Watchtower program, featuring on this occasion Judge Rutherford in an electrical transcription of his celebrated lecture on “The Resurrection of the Dead”. Judge Rutherford stands as a towering figure in the world today by reason of his masterful defense of the Bible as the Word of God. The bringing back of the dead is one of the two great and vital truths taught in the Bible. You are now about to hear something you have never heard before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lecture followed, and we heard it all, every word, but toward its close the dial was turned to bring in AVAIL’, Columbus, when we heard Judge Rutherford’s clear and lucid lecture concluded. As the concluding announcement was given, the dial was switched again, this time to AVGAR, Cleveland, and we heard the opening announcement. A quick turn of the dial to AVK’B.C, Cincinnati, and another to WORC, AVoreester, Mass., revealed the fact that all three of these stations were making the same amiouncewont simultaneously, and a moment ■ la.ter Judge Rutherford’s kindly voice was saying :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “resurrection” means standing up again to life. If the dead are to live again it follows that they are now dead and not alive anywhere. The resurree-llfOlbljhe dead is so plainly taught in the Bible that there can be no doubt about, it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To know that those now dead and in the grave will bo awakened and brought back brings hope and consolation to those- who mourn the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">dead. No one could know this without having proof from a reliable source. The Bible contains that proof. The books published and now being distributed amongst the people show exactly where in the Bible to find these proof texts. The whole question is there made plain and easily understood by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the privilege of those who understand theB<sup>?</sup>blc to comfort others who desire consolation. The Scriptures use the word “sleep” to describe death bees use sleep denotes a state of unconsciousness from which............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">there is an awakening. Hence it is written, in 1 Thes-...........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">salonians 4:13, 1.4 and 17:<sup>:</sup> But I woul d not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are^“&quot;‘ asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Then wc-which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall wc </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'■■■■■A </span><span class="font5">ever be with the Lord. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Babylon Getting It, and How!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally we shifted from one station to-another; and as we made one of these shifts we ......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">heard something that perhaps Babylon did n-'n like to have told so plainly, but it is the truth nevertheless:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many good parents have lost their children at tlrf.’ytri &quot;hand of the enemy death. Such children are not in ■' heaven now, nor in purgatory, but arc in the gravri'&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; which in poetic phrase is described by the prophet as the “'land of the enemy”. Such record a] „&gt; are Jeremiah 31:15-17: “'Rachel weeping for her riifidren refused to be comforted, because they were not. Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded,..............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land . of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.” This promise is emphatic that the dead shall be awakened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...........................</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy have told sorrowing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">babe was in heaven with the angels and enjoying bliss. If that were true, then the parents should not sorrow for them at all. The statement is wholly false, as shown by the Scriptures, because the Jiabd “land of the enemy”, which is death,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">due time will be brought back and united with, its parents. For many centuries Satan has beclouded the issue concerning the resurrection of the dehdj<sup>!!</sup>hM<sup>s</sup>hSi..............................</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">done this by having his agents teach the people that the dead are alive, in heaven, purgatory or hell. Not wishingto make themselves unpopular bysaying babes are in hell, the clergy have put them, in heaven, and that without any Scriptural authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We rejoiced as we realized to the full that Babylon’s punishment was reaching- unto heav-teh .and.'was “lifted up even to the skies”. We could imagine in our minds’ eyes the destroying wind of truth that was sweeping over Massillon. We could imagine the Lord of hosts filling the streets of Massillon with men as with caterpillars. As a matter of fact there were about 250 Bible Students there, and as we shifted our radio car from one point to another we must have seen nearly a score of them. Meantime, wherever wo went Judge Rutherford’s lectures on the resurrection continued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As stated in Psalm 16:10 and Acts 2:34, Jesus died and went to hell. God raised Him up out of that condition. He was the first one resurrected from the dead, and His resurrection is complete proof of the resurrection of the other dead. In order to meet the argument of those who denied the resurrection of the dead in the days of the apostles, these words appear at 1 Corinthians 15:12-18 and verses 20 to 22: “Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; y&lt;- arc yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them triat slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made dll V</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In brief, the plain teaching of the Bible is this: Death befell man because of the violation of God’s law; all mankind inherited the effect of that condemnation; God promised to redeem man from death and to bring him out of the grave, where the dead are; He' sent Jesus Christ to earth, who died and was raised out of death and thereby provided the ransom price, in order that all who believe should not perish, but might live: and this is a guarantee of the resurrection of the dead. At the time of the death and resurrection of Jesus men had been dying for 4,000 years and. had gone into the grave. Not one of them had received a knowledge of God’s provision for salvation. After the resurrection of Jesus this message, recorded in 1 Timothy 2; 3-6 was given to the people: “This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Ohio and Massachusetts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">As we listened we realized that although wo were listening to an electrical transcription that was coming to us at the same time, now a little from Cleveland (WGAR), and then from Cincinnati (WKRC), and from Worcester (WORC), and although it was the actual voice of Judge Rutherford that we heard, yet it was really God himself by this means uttering His voice of truth and causing the vapors to ascend from, the ends of the earth, making lightning with rain, and bringing forth the wind out of His treasures. (Jer. 51:16) With inescapable logic the message continued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How could it be possible for all to have a knowledge of the truth, when billions of them are dead and unconscious? The Bible answer’ is that they must be awakened out of death and be brought back to life and be offered an opportunity to receive such knowledge. Therefore Jesus, in John 5:28, says that in God’s due time all in their graves shall hear His voice and come forth. There would be no reason for the death and resurrection of Jesus unless such would result beneficially to fallen man. No benefit could result to any man without knowledge; and the dead have no knowledge. Therefore God has provided for their awakening out of death in order to get the knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the resurrection there will be two separate and distinct classes. The everlasting home of the first class will be in heaven, while the everlasting home of the other class will be on the earth. Those of the first class will be composed of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus during the period of time that God is selecting His church. The othci? class are those who, during the reign of Christ, receive a knowledge of the truth and prove faithful to the Lord and live on earth. Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ, and one of the inspired writers of the New’ Testament, is of the first class. As one of the inspired writers of the Bible, he shows that in order for a creature to go to heaven he must be a faithful follower of Christ, suffer wuth Him, and be made perfect in the resurrection. In Philippians 3:7, 8, 10 and 11 it is written: “But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea-, doubtless, and I count al I things but loss, for the excellency of tire knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the Joss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and. the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This emphatic statement of the Scriptures should, for ever put to silence the false claim of the clergy that a man may upon his deathbed repent and go straight to heaven. In order for one. to go to heaven and be uhh. the Lord he must be tried and prove faithful. To such Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and J. will give thee a crown of hfc.” The apostle knew he would not go to heaven at death, and that ho must remain dead until the ‘second coming of Christ. Therefore the record, at 2 Timothy 4: 6-8, is: “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous .judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. ’ ’ This is further conclusive proof that the statement made by the clergy, that the good go immediately to heaven, is false. If the good go to heaven immediately at death, then why should there be any resurrection of them at all?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We tried to think of how this would affect those who were really Babylonians, i.e., who were really trying to bolster up the Devil’s organization in this evil day. We thought how very true that from their point of view “the land shall tremble and sorrow; for every purpose of Jehovah shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant”. We thought how true it is that “'the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight; they have remained in their holds, their might hath failed; they became as women”.</span></p>

And in Revelation. 20:6 it is written: ‘Blessed and holy are they that have part in the first resurrection.’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' I ■ ■■J iiiAnjSll</span></p>

In support, of this <sub>; </sub>statement it is written, in Acts 24:15: “ There shall ■ be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and <sub>: </sub>unjust.” And in Acts 17:31 the record is that God has appointed a day or due time in which He will , judge all mankind in righteousness by Jesus Christ, ' i and that the resurrection of Jesus is a guarantee thereof. That is the time when the dead will receive the truth. That blessed time is during the period of the 1,000-year reign of Christ.

<p><span class="font6">We shifted our position and ran over to the : other side of town, when faintly we heard the . voice of Judge Rutherford from down in Meridian, Miss., WCOC, coming in once more to Massillon. Five minutes later the powerful KDKA, Pittsburgh, came roaring into the car and we heard the closing announcement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the talk to which you have just listened you heard Judge Rutherford mention the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font5"> This is one of the books by this noted author which have a combined circulation of over eighty million copies. It gives complete and unimpeachable proofs in support of the Bible truth regarding the ’ resurrection of the dead. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font5"> and its two companion books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gov, eminent,</span><span class="font5"> today stand as the only explanation of the resurrection acceptable to critical, intelligent men <sup>r</sup> and women. Write the Watchtower, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y., for further information. Remember:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Judge Rutherford a week from now, same hour,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- After listening to these ten stations we thought we had been monkeying enough with the radio, so we got out and went about our witnessing work. Mr. Howlett himself placed ten of the 22 pieces of literature that remained :.. behind us to continue the work which the radio had been doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the interim we had heard WHK, of Cleveland, giving in Polish, Rumanian and Slovak the same message which Judge Rutherford had been giving in English daring the hours from 9:45 to 11:00 a.m. in which we were privileged to listen in to the message of truth in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We could faintly imagine how, as a result of a witness such as was given in Massillon and such as is being duplicated all over Ohio and ail over the United States and all over the world, it won’t be long before “one post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end”. (Jer. 51: 31) And the “sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof”. We don’t pretend to say that we know what this “sea” means; that is Judge Rutherford’s job, and it is up to him; but it fits the situation that it might refer in this place to the flood of truth that is being poured out from the skies “as the waters cover the sea”. How happy it makes all who have any part in it, no tongue can tell.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>We Go Back to WHK</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Don’t ask for a technical description of WHK. It is just one of more than 200 stations that are broadcasting the messages of the Kingdom; but it is one of the important stations and is being signally blessed. It is a commercial station, an important outlet for the Columbia chain programs intimately connected with the civic life of the great city. On September 1 it will be housed in the colossal new terminal building, in quarters and with furnishings not surpassed by any radio station in the world. In the new quarters it will be adjacent to and associated with some of the most important and influential business institutions of the city. An expert staff of thirty keeps everything in smooth running order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the convention in Massillon a colporteur just returned from Columbus, Ga., spoke feelingly in her testimony of the excellent results she had placing literature in Columbus because of the clear way in which WHK served the territory in which she had been working. Many other testimonies referred to the service which WHK is rendering. Several mentioned approvingly the “forum”, informal Sunday afternoon 'discussion, featuring various aspects of present truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Does not this help one to realize what a marvelous work the radio is doing in the spread of the truth? Those who know much about the actual door-to-door service work fully realize the stupendous influence these radio lectures are exerting and how they are preparing the way for the “locusts” and “caterpillars” to do their work of leaving Judge Rutherford’s books and booklets in the homes of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">An appeal to Manager Howlett brought the loan of some letters from abroad reporting the great satisfaction WHK has, at different times, given to radio fans in the Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand and other places in the Pacific Ocean, and the Bermudas in the Atlantic Ocean. We give extracts from a few of these letters, believing they will be appreciated by many of our readers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Le Son’s Bay, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. “Just a few lines about the test transmission of your new 5,000-watt station. It may surprise you to know that your station is received here in New Zealand, and greater still will be your surprise when you i*ead of its performance. I tuned in on WHK this evening at 8:10, one hour before sunset. Volume then was loud enough to be heard all over the house (12 rooms); but it increased rapidly until 9:00 p.m. (4:00 p.m. your time), when each item, could be heard plainly ‘two miles’ away from the loudspeaker. Tonal quality leaves nothing to be desired, and I can honestly say that WHK is the first station I have heard on the 200-550 meter band that does not fade. This may seem strange, but it is positively true. For the whole fifty minutes that I listened there was not the slightest variation in transmission. You can imagine what a thrill it is to be listening to a station over eight thousand miles away coming in just like </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> local and with no interference whatever. Not one word of the announcer was missed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lowburn Ferry, Near Cromwell, Otago, New Zealand. “You might be interested to learn I picked up your station at 25 minutes past nine on January 8. Upon looking up an atlas I find Cleveland is 41° 28' North and 81° 4.0' West. Lowburn Ferry is 45° 28' South and 169° 12' East. U.S.A, is ahead of New Zealand time. Cleveland is ahead of New Zealand 88 degrees and. four minutes. ... I calculated the distance as 6,053 miles. The following are the portions of the program I heard. [We omit these] [Later] A report from Quebec that it is coming in fine. Reports from Manitoba and Three Rivers. It seems very wonderful that I should hear your voice 6,000 miles away in a fraction, of a second, yet it takes a letter a matter of weeks. I live 150 miles away from Dunedin, the base of Commander Byrd’s Polar Expedition. It is the middle of summer here now; peaches and tomatoes are ripening, lambs fattening, etc. The tourist season is in full swing. Some very fine American cars are on the road. I was given a ride on a Chrysler ’’ 75 the other day.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Before we realized it, lunch time arrived, and we were escorted to the factory dining room where we were seated with the three Richman brothers and other company executives.

English. French, German, Italian and Latin run in that way: I love, thou lovest, he loves; or I walk, thou walk-est, he walks. But do you know that that is a very bad tvay for a verb to run? Do you know that the old Hebrew’ people arranged their verbs the otlrnr way around,: u-fe is, thou art. T am’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then he aib.wd: “That is the way to look at life.

Thai is the way to think and to Jive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who heard this story was so struck by the thought that he could not-rest until he found a Hebrew scholar able to tell him whether it was really true that Hebrew words&lt;are&lt;'eo-iijti-gated in this way. “Yes,” said The scholar,sMbe-Hebr ew verb i </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font6"> e on.j ugate d as you/ say.

The rate charged was 11.34 cents a kilowatt hour. The citizens decided to take advantage of a clause in the franchise which permitted the city to purchase the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many citizens objected. They claimed that the plant was old junk, dilapidated, worn out, and would have to be rebuilt entirely. Nevertheless the consulting engineers advised the purchase at the large price of $550,000. Now note the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. The plant has been wholly paid for out of earnings; it has been wholly rebuilt; new and larger water mains have been laid; a complete new distribution system has been built; the gas plant in its entirety has been constructed; the heating plant has been rebuilt, and the plant is now worth $1,846,820.51.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">'(’By MaJeobu R. Patterson. former governor of Tennessee. Reprinted from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Butter, Cheese a»$ Egg Jwrnet)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">B</span><span class="font6">LIND Homer sang of Trojan wars and heroes; Virgil, of men. and arms; Horace, of love and Faleraian. wine; Dante, of the infernal regions; and Milton, of Paradise; but if I had the genius of all these old masters combined, a harp with a thousand strings, and the world for an audience, I would sing- with all my heart and soul of a cow—proclaim her virtues— and perpetuate her name to the remotest generations. If I were a sculptor and had the power to chisel my thoughts in marble, I would search the quarries of the earth for the purest, whitest stone, and somewhere, in an enchanted wood, where the skies are bluest, and the waters purest, and the birds sing sweetest far into the soft and mellow moonlight nights, I would begin a work of love and duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would bid the cold marble speak' for me, as I plied the chisel to its sides until the rough, hard surface took the shape I wished, and at last a cow stood revealed, wide and kind eyes, in a posture of patient waiting to give the rich contents of her swelling udder, and bless the receivers with joy and health and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would make a base on which this spirit of my dreams would stand, and around its rim I would carve the figures of dear little babes, their hands and expectant faces raised toward their best friend in all the animal world, the friend that never fails them; the one that puts the firm pink flesh upon their tender frames, the one that brings dimples and smiles like the touch of angels’ wings, when the sweet life-giving milk trickles in a velvet sugar stream down, their tiny throats, mitil the bottle falls away and sleep comes to caress and hold them still in its protecting arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cow is an uncrowned queen without a scepter, and her kingdom is all the land between the seas. Her motto is service, and she always gives more than she receives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the children are well, she makes them better, and they grow and flourish with her constant benefactions. When they are sick and wasted, she raises them up and starts them right again. Her milk is the one perfect food for young and old. It holds every element to sustain and strengthen life. The cow works for all humanity without a complaint, and was never known to strike for higher wages. 'All she wants in exchange for the myriad blessings that she confers is enough to eat and a place to Ue down at night. The cow is a. lady among all the four-footed creatures—a lady that doesn’t need fine clothes, or powder, or lip stick to set off her infinite beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">She is a thorough 'democrat in her habits and opinions. She gives to men and women and children of all races and creeds; is kind to all and favors none above the rest. She is dainty, too, in her tastes. She w<sup>r</sup>ould rather die before she would feed on flesh. Her feed is clover, grain and succulent things of the vegetable world, grass, with which God carpets the earth in living green as it springs fresh from the heart of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cow is domestic. She loves home. She knows the place where she lives, and is faithful to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If she must wander away for feed, when the shadows begin to lengthen in the evening, she will be standing at the gate, asking for admission, and a chance to yield her rich burden which she has stored in daylight hours. The cow is the poor man’s chief reliance, his tried and trusted friend. She is true to him when all the world is cold. The cow does not seek strange society, or run after the rich, as some of her two-legged sisters do. That is not her ambition. She has higher and different conceptions of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Her concern is to help all humanity, and the man w’ho lives in a cabin with seven tow-headed children to bring him joy, and poverty is as much the recipient of her bounty as the rich man with three automobiles, two dogs and four servants, without one child to disturb his sleep or bring a smile of joy to his starving soul. I believe that a cow loves the poor man best, for he needs her most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If all the cows in the world should die or dry up tomorrow, it would bring untold calamity upon mankind. We could get along better without railroads, banks or the cotton crop, for without the cow the race would sicken, decay and finally perish. May we honor and praise her as she deserves. I hope that as we advance in knowledge, when we cease to be cruel and selfish, we will quit murdering and eating cows that have given us strength and comfort and. saved our babies’ lives. When this happy day comes, I should like to see a large fund collected to build an &quot;old cows’ home”, surrounded by luscious</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pastures and running wafer, where these old and tried friends could pass their remaining 'days and die in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, In the fullness of age and the thought of duty well done, as they how their knees in reverence for the last time, and settle down for the last repose, may their pass easily and naturally into a better and fairer land, where the grass is forever green, and neither flies nor tiger men can molest them or make them afraid,.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">OME three years ago my husband was having considerable trouble with his stomach and very bad spells of nausea and headache. About that time we began reading the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden ''.Age</span><span class="font6"> articles on aluminum poisoning and its ill effects on the human system, and at once decided to discard our aluminum cooking ware; everything’ went save the percolator. As a consequence, the headaches grew less and less frequent and less severe. In April, 1929, I finally found an all-glass percolator (Silex is the trade name) and out went my last piece of aluminum; and no more headaches or nausea till June of 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometime previously we had finished all our jellies that had been made in the agate preserving kettle, and all that remained were a few glasses of grape jelly that had been cooked in aluminum. These I hated to throw out, thinking that 'we might use them in small quantities and &quot;get away with it”. We were using this made-in-aluminum jelly<sup>7-</sup> about one week in June, 1930, and at but one meal in the day, when my husband had another spell of nausea and headache, the worst one yet, and it almost laid him out. I recognized the symptoms at once and immediately threw out the remainder of the jelly, and neither nausea nor headache has returned during the last six months! Aluminum is fine for making chairs, automobile bodies and airplane motors, but not for cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the same connection, I also had an interesting experience at the dentist’s on the occasion of my last annual visit. The year previous he had commented on how rapidly my teeth were &quot;breaking down” and the tissue was softening ; he told me my gums did not lock as healthy as usual, and that I ought to come back to him in six months, not wait until the year had passed. After reading the first article on the aluminum poisoning and of its dire effects on the mouth and teeth,. I immediately thought of what he had told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I returned to the dentist for a couple of minor fillings, one of the first things he said was, &quot;Why, Mrs. C——what have you done to your teeth!” His look of amazement and surprise rather startled me, and I quickly plied the question, &quot;Why, what is wrong!” I thought lie seemed to be spending an extra amount of energy on the teeth when he was preparing them, for the fillings, and wondered what could be wrong. He remarked, &quot;Nothing is wrong, but’ what have you done to your teeth, they are so hard again, and your gums look so healthy, too ? I recall telling you 1 was worried about the condition of your mouth a year ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He paused for my answer, and when I told him I was eating the same rvay as usual, and cleaning with the same kind of powder as heretofore, but' that I had simply thrown, out my aluminum cooking utensils, he smiled and replied he would like to believe that was all I had clone. Of course, he is of the old school, and it takes time to change their habit of thinking. I know </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font6"> teeth are stronger this year than last, and on. my next visit in February I hope to have the dentist fully convinced.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Common Salt </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By H. 'J. North (Estonia)} . &quot;Salt is good.&quot;—Mark 9; 50.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">TjpOR' some years I have read with much inter-A- est the various articles in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden &quot;Age. </span><span class="font6">respecting the way to health, and have gleaned therefrom many thoughts and ideas, which I have, to the best of my ability, tried to put in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not having seen in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> any article on “Common Salt”, and having recently read a book with that title by Gumpel, I wish to express my opinion thereon, with the hope that it will be beneficial to many of your readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Salt is one of the commonest of earth’s provisions for man and 'beast. In the sea it is found in abundance, and in many places there are vast deposits of this essential mineral. Salt, when mined from the earth, is, generally speaking, pure common salt, chemically called sodium chloride. It is this salt that is so vital to man and the human organism, and of which I write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Strict vegetarians claim that all the salts necessary for health and strength are to be found in fruits and vegetables, and that other salts are not to be added. My experience with this diet taught me that it is insufficient to sustain the health of a vigorous colporteur, and with a return to a meat diet I had greater vigor and strength to carry on. WTiy is this ? Why do strict vegetarians, in the main, look so pale, unhealthy and undernourished? I am convinced that it is due to the low percentage of common salt in their diet compared with that of a diet containing meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Strict vegetarians state that the addition of this salt is unnecessary, and some go to the extent of stating that it is injurious to the human body. This is a grave and serious error, and has led many of them to an early grave. Heart failure, syncope and strokes are due to a lack of common salt in the system, particularly in the blood. I believe that such diseases as cancer, influenza, ansemia, smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid, cholera, etc., are not contracted by any who have a sufficiency of common salt in their system, which keeps them immune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now let me state what I believe to be the proofs of these assertions. Common salt in solution has the wonderful ability of passing through animal membrane and tissue, and can be, and is, transferred from any part of the body to another part where it is needed, by this means and by the blood. The reader can test this for himself. Take a good. waieriiglit leather bag and pour in. water. The water will remain there indefinitely; but sprinkle a little salt in the water, and very soon it will begin to drip through the bag. After’ a fall of snow in London, salt is scattered in the streets. This results in salt water solution, which quickly’ penetrates the soles of boots and shoes, in this case causing many to suffer a severe chill, because salt, and snow is a common freezing mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blood is composed mainly of red corpuscles and serum, the former floating freely in the latter. In order that the red corpuscles may be preserved and function properly, this serum must contain at least 0.2 percent of common salt. The serum will retain 0.5 percent, and any surplus is easily dispersed by means of the kidneys. In fact the kidneys cannot function and pass off waste without the aid of common salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order that the blood may contain the minimum amount of this salt (0.2 percent) for its preservation, it will draw salt from other parts of the body and thus leave these parts deficient in salt and they become inefficient. For instance, taking salt from the nerves, heart, brain or muscles causes them to become water-saturated, flabby<sup>7</sup>’ and diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Should the serum lack sufficient common salt, the red corpuscles are destroyed. These corpuscles are in shape something like a dumb-bell, and can be seen with the aid of a microscope. When salt is lacking in the blood the red corpuscles absorb water, swell into globular shape and finally burst, and if sufficient are destroyed, the person becomes anaemic and subject to all kinds of diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the rod corpuscles .are thus destroyed they throw their contents, haemoglobin and potassium salts into the serum. The effect of free potassium salts in the blood is instantly poisonous upon the heart, and if the heart is inefficient through lack of salt, then heart failure follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not pleasant to' see the obstinacy of strict vegetarians who absorb large quantities of potassium salts through eating fruits and vegetables and cereals only, and refuse the very thing necessary to turn the potassium salts into health and strength. Without the agency of common salt, these potassium salts cannot build up the body, but may poison it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyone may observe the effect of salt. Take</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a drop of your blood, and note through a microscope the above described shape of the red corpuscles. Now add a drop of water, and you will see them, swell to the bursting point. If now two or three grains of salt are added, then. you will observe that they discharge the water and return to 'their original shape. If the salt is not added they will burst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another serious effect of swollen or burst red corpuscles is that they cannot absorb oxygen from the air in the lungs, which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oxygen</span><span class="font6"> is so vital to health and vitality. Neither can they so easily pass through the channels (veins, etc.), and so cause bad circulation, and extra force and pressure is required from, the heart to force it. The red corpuscles can be kept functioning in a healthy state only if there is sufficient common salt in the serum of the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It appears therefore that common salt must be supplied to the blood and that it is of first importance. Water supplied to a human body deficient in salt acts deleteriously, causing damage and disease. A body deficient in salt must have either water extracted or salt supplied in order to preserve the necessary minimum of 0.2 percent in the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Common salt plays a most important part in the process of digestion. Food is digested by three juices, the saliva, the gastric juice and the bile. Saliva flows in the mouth and mingles with the food when chewed and enters with it into the stomach, where the gastric juice acts upon it. The bile then carries on the work, especially upon the fats in the intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That digestion should be good, the gastric juice must contain salt and hydrochloric acid. This acid obtains its chlorine constituent from common salt, and is secreted by the blood. A body deficient in common salt cannot supply this chlorine to form the hydrochloric acid, and another acid is formed, called lactic acid, which is injurious to digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bile is secreted by the liver and normally contains a large proportion of common salt, and is necessary for digestion. Without hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice, and salt in the bile, putrefaction takes place, and large quantities of food cannot be assimilated by the body. A great deal could be said upon this subject, but this article must necessarily be abbreviated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Salt can be supplied </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">naturally</span><span class="font6"> in two ways. The first and most important is surely by means of the digestive tract; the second, by salt baths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cooking and eating food with the addition, of salt as usual to suit the taste, is one means of supplying salt to the body, but not the best. Its action is limited because of chemical combination in the stomach. To insure noninterference, it should be taken in solution with, water, not at meal times. Drinking at meals can be limited or stopped and substituted by salt water solutions at night and in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The solution of a half or three-quarters of a teaspoonful of common, salt in a tumbler of water will be found very pleasant to the taste after a short trial. The object is to insure that the body has as nearly as possible the 0.5 percent of common salt in the solution in the serum of the blood. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Care</span><span class="font6"> should be taken to see that not too much liquid (water in various beverages) is drunk without supplying sufficient salt to counteract the watering of the tissues of the body, nerves, muscles, brain, heart, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second, means of supplying salt to the body is by means of salt baths of sea water strength (2J pounds of salt to every 10 gallons of water). Most people feel limp and languid after a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“good hot</span><span class="font6"> bath”. But everyone who takes a “good bath” with the above proportion of salt therein will feel invigorated, refreshed, and perfectly cleansed, although one may remain in the bath for half an hour or even an hour. One will feel the opposite of languid!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why is this ? The explanation is simple, when the wonderful quality of salt of passing through animal tissue and membrane is remembered. When one takes a bath without salt, the common salt inside the body is extracted because of its affinity for water, and water goes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in,</span><span class="font6"> thus watering and desalting the system at the same time. Naturally the body feels the loss, and one feels, and is, languid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When, however, a strong salt water bath is taken, the result is reversed: salt goes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font6"> and water is extracted. This explains the benefit many patients receive at watering places where brine baths are taken. Everyone can have the benefits of brine baths and salt waters in their own home, as soon as they will, with the very minimun of cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The argument in favor of salt is so simple, and the results so quickly appreciated in my own ease and in that of many friends, that 1 cannot refrain from writing about it. I wish to learn more, and should like other persons’ opinions. I am. truly thankful for my health and vigor, 'due to an unbiased trial, and hope others will receive similar vitality and glow of health.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">■ fW -khPIL 22, 1929, the town of New W' Martinsville, W. Va„ purchased and took over the electric system for the town from a private corporation. The company’s rate for the first 25 kilowatt hours was 8c, and that for the second 25 kilowatt hours, 9c, an average of 8jo for the first 50 kilowatt hours. The town reduced this rate to ”c, which meant crossing off about $5,000 a year from the bills of its customers. Meantime, in the short time the plant has been operated by the municipality, the street illumination has been improved and the plant has made a clear profit of $36,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Identifying the Insane</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N NEARLY all hospitals for the insane there are one or more patients whose identity is unknown when they are admitted. Either they refuse to talk or they have forgotten their names and addresses; and so are entered on the books as “John Doe No. 1”, “John Doe No. 2,” and so on. I have known as many as six “John Does” to be at one time in one such institution where I worked. Trying to find out from them the facts concerning themselves takes ingenuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nobody can be legally kept in such institutions until he or she has been certified as insane; and so<sub>s</sub> when the police of a neighboring city sent a man to Benvenue, where I worked, he was at first confined for a day or two in what was called “The Home”. He was locked up and, as he was a powerfully built chap, who did not want to stay, he was put in a strait-jacket and the arms of the jacket tied to the bed, It was my duty to unloose him at intervals to feed and care for him, and I was detailed to come from the asylum, to do this. One afternoon I had him up (still jacketed) and, before putting him back to bed and tying him in. I put a lighted cigar in his mouth to see if he used tobacco. He seemed to enjoy the smoke. Close by was an. inmate shaving himself; and, remembering the antics that monkeys go through when they see their reflections in a mirror, I took the mirror the man was using and held it in front of the smoking John Doe, He smiled at his reflection,’ and pointing to the glass I asked, “Who is this F He instantly said, “John Blasko.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> pointed to him and asked: “This John Blasko, too?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“'Sure,” was the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I then asked all about John Blasko, whether he had children, as to his wife, where he lived; and he answered coherently. With the information I went to the office; and when they had communicated with the adjoining’ county, from which he had said John Blasko came, the man’s wife came, identified him, and finally took him -home. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On another occasion I was on night watch', in the receiving ward, w<sup>T</sup>here we had a youth of about eighteen, ’who to all intents was dumb, so far as we knew, and who was also listed as John Doe. It was a hot August night, and all the windows were open, although the bars were still there. I was sitting at a table in the dim light, reading, and occasionally the inmates</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>&quot;John A, Mackay &amp;&nbsp;(Pennsylvania)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">went noiselessly past me to the wafer cooler, to get a drink and then return to bed. Without looking up I sensed that one of them, on his way back to bed, had stopped and was leaning against the wall opposite me. Without looking up I ordered him to get to bed; and then, as I looked up. I sarv it was the voiceless John Doe. To my amazement he did not move, but said, most distinctly: “I smell fire.” Now fire in such a place is something that every worker dreads; and so I asked sharply, “Where ?” and was on my feet and going toward him almost without yet realizing that the dumb John Doe had awakened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In my room,” he said, and started toward the little room where, with three others, he slept. I was there before he was, and, to my relief, soon found that the smoke, from the burning straw at the stables, was coming in through the window and that there was no fire in the asylum building. But I kept up the conversation with him, and before morning had found out who he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next day he was assigned to the 'diningroom to help lay the dishes, wash them, and tidy up; and inside of a month he was able to go home. But for that chance smell of fire he might have been there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'Another time the police brought' in a young man who was most unsteady on his feet. They had no name for him, as he would not talk, and they said he was “It”. So while he was officially booked as John Doe, he was known among the attendants and the other inmates as “It”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alter we got him bathed and put him in overalls he was put in a chair, and he immediately let his head and body fall forward until the crown of his head was touching the floor. This was his favorite position for three days; and, while he could have been strapped to the chair in an upright position, he was allowed to assume this funny posture which he seemed to prefer. He could remain in this position for hours. We had to feed him, and he had an enormous appetite. The explanation for this came on the third day, when he took an epileptic fit. This was the explanation of the riddle: As soon as he came out of the fit; we started to clean him out, and stopped feeding him until he was able to stand and sit upright. Then, for the first time, he spoke, when he began to get real hungry, by asking why he 'did not get something to eat when the others did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font6"> attendant told him: “You’re in training for a prize fight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Til get something to eat soon or I’ll lick ■Jack Dempsey,” he retorted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So he got something to eat, but was put on a diet; for most epileptics are gluttonous. He soon disclosed his name and his relatives, who were informed of his whereabouts and came to visit him. He had simply been getting over a series of fits when the police got him and thought he was insane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another John Doe, who turned out to be a vict</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font6"> of too much synthetic “hootch”, would not eat. Before forcibly feeding any such inmate it is usual, if'they are otherwise physically all right, to let them go hungry for at least a week to be sure they are actually not wishing to eat. Food was offered the “hootch hound”; but he would always go away from it, without tasting it. The attendant got the idea that he believed the food was poisoned. So the attendant prepared a bowl of food for himself and, after everybody -was served, began to eat from his own bowl, letting the hootch victim see him. When he had taken about half a dozen spoonfuls gustily, in sight of the patient, he was called away, by prearrangement. He hastily put the bovd on the table and went out; and the hootch man grabbed the bowl and finished the last morsel in jig time. He saw that it did not hurt the attendant, and thought it was something special. This proved he was hungry; and it was easy to get him to eat, after that.

<p><span class="font6">THE loud little handful.—as usual—will shout for war. The pulpit will—warily and cautiously-—object—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font6"> first; the great, big, dull bulk of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be a war, and will say, earnestly and.indignantly, Tt is unjust and dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then the handful -will shout louder. A few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war with speech and pen, and at first will have a hearing and be applauded; but it will not last long; those others will outshout them, and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Before long 'you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from the platform and free no sinister plots against him, and finally told who he was and in what bank he had his money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But not all the John Does are so easily overcome and their identity established; and sometimes men who are perfectly sane will be taken into poorhouses and asylums and give misinformation. In more than one such instance men have, to my knowledge, died and been buried as friendless, only to have relatives finally locate them and go to the expense of having them dug up from the potter's field to be taken to the family plot. There are so many folks with grievances against their relatives. They claim to have been cheated, or mistreated, or to be misunderstood. So they cast off their relatives and go into retirement in such places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the time is at hand when all such bad relations between people, all such lapses from whatever cause, will be removed, under the beneficent reign of the Messiah. Then instead of insanity and dourness and terror there will be a universal love that will do away with all necessity for John Does, barred windows, straitjackets, and tricks to get hungry men to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no place like the interior of an asylum for the insane to see that selfishness run to seed is insanity. The insane man or woman always wants his or her own way. They do not care how others are affected, so long as they can do as they please. For such as can be cured there is nothing that acts more quickly than regularity; for irregularity has, in almost every instance, been, the primary cause of their unbalance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers—as earlier—but do not dare to say so. And now the whole nation—pulpit and all—will take up the war cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man. who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths will cease to open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark95"></a>What Is the Methodist Hell?</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is confusion in the minds of some of the readers of the Grand Rapids </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font6">as to what is the Methodist hell. This may be said to be principally due to the letter of Rev. 'A. T. Cartland, Lowell, Mich., which letter appeared in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> of December 28, and said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Doubtless here and there may be found a preacher who believes in a hell of literal fire, where the wicked suffer torment; but such men are a long- ways from being representative of the Christian ministry of today. For 32 years I have been a minister in the Methodist Episcopal church, and have never believed or preached such a doctrine. My father before me, a Methodist minister ‘of the old school’, did not hold or preach it. Among' my associates and friends in the ministry I do not know a single man who, to my knowledge, believes or teaches a hell of literal fire and torment. I have heard a good many sermons by ministers of my own and other denominations, but I have never yet heard any man preach a hell of literal fire. In my library arc a goodly number of volumes of sermons by representative ministers of the great Christian denominations—Congregational, Baptist, Presbyterian and Episcopal clergymen of England and America; but I have not discovered in any of these volumes a single sermon that teaches the doctrine of a hell of literal fire. I would not know where to look for such a sermon preached in the last one hundred years. I think that Mr. Rutherford and the I.B.S.A. are guilty of a gross injustice in broadcasting such a charge against the Christian ministers of our day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We presume Bev. Gartland has heard of Bev. Dr. L. W. Munhall, of Philadelphia, now 88 years of age, a Methodist minister and evangelist for the past 63 years. It is said of Bit Munhall that he has induced 200,000 persons to hit the sawdust trail, that this is probably more than can be credited to any other evangelist, and that he is an admirer of Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson. Surely Rev. Cartland has heard of Dr. Munhall. Surely he knows of Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson, and knows full well that they preach hell-fire and brimstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason why we bring this matter up is because The United Press had an interview with Dr. Munhall, on the occasion of the recent meeting of the Evangelists’ Association at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Dr. Munhall is dean of that association, and it would be a discourtesy to Rev. Cartland to intimate that he did not know of the Evangelists’ Association, and did not respect it, Well, the United Press</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">quotes Dr. Munhall on the “hell” question, and here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The preachers who don’t stick to the Bible are nothing but perjurers,” he said today. “When they were ordained they took an oath to preach the Scriptures, and if they don’t believe in the Bible as it was written they should quit the ministry.” “Do you think evangelism is on the decline ? ” he was asked. ‘ ‘ It is, ’<sup>3 </sup>he replied. “Church pews are empty all over the country. The church heads have decided to let these young ministers preach their fool notions and the people have decided there is no use being saved. I am an old-time Methodist. I know my Bible from cover to cover. These modernist ministers can’t fool me, The Holy Word says there is a hell, and a hell there is. I preach it—fire, brimstone and eternal torment for the wicked. If there is no hell, then what is there to bo saved from? I ask you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can leave Judge Rutherford out of this. All he did in his lecture “Is Hell Hot?” was toprove from the Scriptures that the Bible hell is not hot, and anybody who is interested can prove this for himself in five minutes by looking up the marginal readings of the following five texts in his own Bible at home. See Psalm 49:15; 55: 15; 86:13; Isaiah 14:9; Jonah 2:2; 1 Corinthians 15: 55; Revelation 20:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thing we should like to see done is to have Reverend Cartland or Reverend Munhall or somebody qualified tell us all just what the Methodist church does stand for on the “hell” question. It would seem that Reverend Cartland has never heard of one of the leading lights of the Methodist ministry or that Reverend Munhall has a poor opinion of Reverend Cartland’s theology, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it possible that both these men, who differ so markedly in their views, are in error, and that both are trying to hang on to a hell which the above marginal citations show exists only in their imaginations? We think such is the case, and that Judge Rutherford is right on this question, just right, because his position is Scriptural, and unanswerable, Scripturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Cartland mentions the Presbyterian belief on this subject. Well, it was a president of the famous Presbyterian institution, Princeton University, that gave us this gem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After you shall have worn out the age of the sun, moon and stars in your dolorous groans and lamentations. without rest day and night, or one minute’s ease, you shall yet have no hope of ever being delivered. After you have worn out a thousand more such ages, 590 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">you shall have no hope, but shall know that you are not one whit nearer to the end of your torments; but that still there are the same groans, the same shrieks, the same doleful cries incessantly to be made by you, . . . Your bodies, which shall have been burning all this while in those glowing flames, shall not ^ave been consumed, but will remain to roast through eternity. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This celebrated divine also expressed most eloquently the peculiar idea that the happiness of the saved would be increased by the sufferings of the lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ The</span><span class="font5"> sight of the torments which they suffer, ’ ’ said Dr, Edwards, ‘ brill exalt the happiness of tile saints forever; for it will make them more sensible of it; it will give them a more lively relish of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Parents will see their children, children their parents, wives their husbands and husbands their wives, in ineffable agony, and prize their own felicity the more; a sense of the opposite misery in all cases greatly increases the relish of any joy. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic view of this subject remains unchanged, as witness the following ex</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tract from a sermon by Bev. J. M. 'J. Quinn, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New York City, November 23, 1930: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the close of the ecclesiastical year the church desires to impress upon us the fact that there is a. hell. Those who say that this business of the fear of the Lord is not the Lord’s way of requesting service and love because God would never coerce love, have not apparently read God’s own words. If God were asked by a soul up for judgment if there is a hell. He might answer, ‘What do you think I died on the cross for? Wasn’t it because I loved you and wanted to save you from hell’s fires and eternal punishment ? You wouldn’t fear a just judge, if you wore innocent.<sup>5</sup> Christ said that it would be better to go into heaven with, but one eye than go to hell with both eyes. God said, ‘Depart from me, ye sinners, into everlasting hell.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Some Facts About the Body</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">/^NE-FOITRTH of all our muscles are in our LT' neck and face. If one-third of our skin is destroyed by fire, acid or other accident, we die. To balance our head on our spine we use twenty muscles. To balance our spine when walking we use 144. In walking, each leg rests half the time. Trie tire standing because neither leg gets rested. With, every step we take, about 300 muscles are used. Our body temperature is regulated and remains constant at 99 degrees. We average about one square yard of skin surface and about ninety square yards of lung surface. Normally we take one breath for every four heart heats. If you stay quietly in bed you save your heart 20,000 beats a day. Your heart beats 40,000,000 times a year. It drives the blood through the arteries at the average rate of thirty feet a second. When you sit quiet it pumps about five pints of blood a minute. Wlien you run uphill it pumps seven times as much, or thirty-five pints. The motor mechanism with which we walk weighs about eighty pounds. Sixty is muscle and 20 is bones. It is impossible to commit suicide by holding the breath, because as soon as consciousness is lost breathing automatically begins again. About fifty percent of our body is carbon. The average muscle is 25 percent efficient. The trained muscle is only 40 percent efficient. We have 2,000,000 tiny pores of sweat glands. There are 500 to the square inch on most of our body, and 2,000 to the square inch in the palms of our hands and soles of our feet. A 160-pound man has about eight pounds (or four quarts) of blood. He can lose up to one and a half quarts at a time and recover.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When she went to mass she left her purse in the seat. It was turned over to her pastor, who also happened to be her employer. He found 1J packages of cigarettes in her purse and asked her, &quot;Do you think St. Mary would smoke these things? and do you not think you ought to be ashamed of yourself?” She retorted, &quot;Do you think Jesus Christ would smoke cigars and 'drive a big Buick sedan?” And she lost her job.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Boldness Pays </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By L. C. Boss (Georgia)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font6">URING four years in the pioneer colporteur field, I have had only four experiences of police interference: one in Colorado, one in Pennsylvania, one in Georgia, and the main one in South Carolina. Mrs. Ross and I were sent to Orangeburg county, S. C., by the Society. We had been, warned that we vzould probably be arrested there, so we took the bull by the horns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The officials had previously arrested two colporteurs. I went first to the police station and asked for the chief. He wms at home. I found out where his home was and started to canvass the block he lived in, just in-a matter-of-course way. He came to the door in person and I canvassed him, telling him firmly but kindly what our work was. I then offered him a combination of books for cash. He acted as if he had never heard of them before. I finished his block and another block, and nothing happened. The next forenoon I worked the business district. He and three of his officers stood and watched me, but said not one word. I had previously hired a lawyer and told him I would not pay a fine under any condition, but would fight the case to the bitter end. We were not molested, and left the territory of our own accord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Pennsylvania I told the burgess that the only way he or the preachers on his town council could make me stop going from door to door w<sup>T</sup>as to throw me in jail, and then I would go at it again every time I regained my freedom. He took me at my word, and said,&quot;“Go ahead.” We completed the territory with no more trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you call the Devil’s bluff boldly the chances are ten to one he will “get behind you”. I have not even been put in jail, and I talked mighty straight in all four cases. I have never meant to be unkind, but am outspoken and call a spade a spade. Now do not mistake this as a boast or as braggadocio, for I will confess that after the flesh I am a rank cowaid. But I took the Lord at His word. (Heb. 13:5, 6) If we are doing the Lord’s work in His appointed way, we do not have to be brave. Just take God at His word. He said, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Hag. 2:4) In the February 15 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> (paragraphs 28 and 29) is the best advice in this world as to just how to meet opposition in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would like to call to your attention that if you turn and run from a cur, in nearly every ease it will bite you; if you face it boldy it will 'drop its tail between its legs and scurry off. The same principle will apply to the Devil and his crowd; for the Lord has said, “The fear of man bringeth. a snare.”—Prov. 29: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again I state that without the help of God’s organization I could not go at all, for my flesh surely rebels daily at the rebuffs. I would not go from door to door with anything but the “truth” for $50.00 a day just to make a living. But since God has shown me His will and my part in the covenant with Him, I thank Him for the great privilege of being able to go and take the rebuffs, and pray daily for strength to push a broken body to the limit, which is unto death in any form it may come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyone can get along in the pioneer field who enters in “the love of the truth” and whose purpose is to sing praises to Jehovah’s name, and sings those praises at least two-thirds of the time one would have to give to any part of Satan’s organization.</span></p>

The United States originated the Kellogg Pact; Mr. Kellogg’s countrymen are spending more on armaments than any other country. Next to them comes that other pacifist power, Great Britain, with an outlay of 115 millions in 1928 — 24 millions more than that of France, whose militarist tendencies Great Britain deplores. We all know this (though I do not think we all realize the Anglo-American preeminence in military preparation) and we all know that this way lies ruin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">ECURITY, safeguard, that is what the gov-, ernments today claim to be seeking. Regardless of whether the governments or the politicians are sincere or not, Heaven knows that surely the people want security. They want peace, established on an unshakable basis, and for ever assured. The World War was enough for them. They want no more of that. Yet they are aware that the armaments of the nations are larger today than at the commencement of the world conflict. They know that the lion’s share of the revenues of all the governments are squandered for military purposes. They know of the peace bargainings between nations, but also notice how hesitant, uncertain, and suspicious the bargainers are, and the reservations they insist upon, and the safeguard clauses, which allow loopholes in the whole bargain. When a British .workingmen’s party recommends that all governments disarm without agreements between themselves, thus setting one another the right example, they give it scant notice. When a conference delegate makes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> bold bid that all nations agree to disarm absolutely, they shrink back into their shells. Those with clear insight into the basis upon which the present world system rests know that selfishness will never permit the nations to disarm, nor </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font6"> they lay down all arms. Nations which have built themselves up and acquired territories and markets by the use of armies and ships will never kick the foundation from beneath their feet. Where or how, then, will the people get security?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom well knows that He who is called “The Prince of Peace” was born into this earth nineteen centuries ago. They know that at His birth in Bethlehem an angelic choir sang, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” To the people that song is practically a worn-out, stale song now. They have heard it quoted so much, but have never yet seen it fulfilled by the men and parties who claim that it’s up to them to make the song come true. The people have all along been taught that “peace on earth, good will to men” must be established progressively, and they should be patient, for the political, financial and religious leaders will establish it by and by. But whatever “progress” there has been seems to have been backward, for after nineteen hundred years in which to make progress we have just had the worst eruption of 'war on earth, ill will to men’ that the world has ever</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark97"></a>er</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">lived through, and more, and worse war is in the preparing. Something is wrong somewhere. Where? In this, that men are looking the wrong way for peace to come. Their security from evil, will never come by institutions and arrangements of men. Men must come to peaceful relations with God, and find safety under* His protection. They must first get rid of the great demon of sin and -wickedness, that is, the Dewi, and this men cannot do of themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter forty-five, verse seven, the great God Jehovah says: “I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace. -and create evil. I the Lord do all these things.” Jehovah God makes peace, and He is not so helpless that He has to depend upon men, and wait upon them, to make peace. Religious leaders, especially, have all along given out the idea that God has left it as man’s job to patch up peace among the nations. Of course, this would allow of some men’s having the opportunity to win worldly fame and glory and. to receive praise and credit for the wonderful accomplishment. But this popular idea is at variance with God’s own Word. “I make peace,” He says, and in Psalm forty-six, verses nine and ten, He has had this recorded: “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder: he burneth the [war] chariot in the fire. Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the [nations], I will be exalted in the earth.” All the prophecies of Sacred Writ unmistakably declare that human efforts at international peace will and must fail, and that God alone will establish world-wide peace by Jesus Christ His dear Son. Nor* will this certain world peace be established gradually by orderly processes and conferences and mutual understandings between peoples, but it will be preceded by the greatest evil this earth will ever have known, and that evil Jehovah God himself creates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Isaiah’s prophecy, above quoted, the Lord says: “I make peace, and create evil.” This does not mean that God makes that which is morally evil, or wicked or depraved. It was the Devil that started moral evil, that is, sin and wickedness, in the universe. God did not create the Devil. The spirit creature who is now “the prince of devils” made a devil out of himself. He was originally, at the time that God made him, a holy, wise, and perfect spirit creature, named </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hey-leyl,</span><span class="font6"> or Lucifer, which means “the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">bright-shining one”. “Devil” means “slanderer” or “defamer” of God’s name, and Lucifer made himself such by using slander against God to deceive the first woman Eve into disobeying God’s sacred law. Through the medium of the serpent the Devil said to Eve: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;c</sup>Ye</span><span class="font6"> shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” It was the selfish aspiration to be worshiped by mankind as a heavenly god, in other words, it was envy toward God his Father, that led Lucifer into the nefarious course which transformed him into Satan, God’s enemy. Here was where, according to the Bible, moral evil had its beginning in heaven and earth. Here the evil of death invaded our earth. God had warned Adam against incurring this evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The evil which God creates is not morally wrong or sinful. The Prophet Isaiah, who wrote the divine utterance respecting evil, used the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ra,</span><span class="font6"> which is translated in other texts of the Bible by the words “'hurt” (twenty times), “harm” (four times), “adversity” (four times), “trouble” (ten times), “affliction” (six, times, “sore” (nine times), “sad” (two times), “calamity,” “distress,” “grief,” “misery,” and “sorrow”. The Scriptures record numerous occasions where Jehovah God visited evil of this sort upon sinners because of the violation of His laws. Such acts of God were the enforcement of His law, and not a.t all morally wrong, but right and in the interest of virtue. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the prohibited tree and God passed upon them the penalty of death, He brought an evil on them which hurt them and caused them misery, grief, distress and sorrow; but God was righteous and in thorough keeping with justice and truth in passing and executing this death sentence upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to make the superstitious people stand in awe of them and submit to them through fear of divine displeasure, religious leaders have made the people believe that God, whose representatives they claim to be, is the One who has brought all the great horrors and calamities which have smitten the people from time to time, such as the San Francisco earthquake, the Mississippi river valley flood, the disastrous volcanic eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and Mount Pelee, the Black Death of Europe in the fourteenth century, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In calling these catastrophes “acts of God” religious teachers have wronged God’s name, and have caused multitudes of people to curse God and to turn aw’ay from Him in bitterness arid feelings of disgust. In reality, these disasters are traceable to the Devil, who the Bible shows has power to use forces of nature in a destructive way; as, for example, when he raised a hurricane to kill the children of the patriarch Job and then smote Job himself with boils from head to foot; also, when he stirred up the terrific storm on the sea of Galilee while the disciples of our Lord were crossing in a small boat and Jesus himself was serenely sleeping in the stern of the boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, where the Scriptures expressly state that God brought calamities upon peoples or nations, it was because His holy name was directly involved. Hence He sent the evil as an expression of His righteous judgment, lest the profaning and flaunting of His name and law should continue to a stage where His creatures in heaven and earth would be eternally injured morally by it. But where the Scriptures do not attach God and His name to the widespread distresses and great adversities which have befallen mankind since Bible times, men, and particularly religious professors, are grossly wrong in casting the responsibility therefor upon God. They are blaspheming God’s name. Therefore let no one think that the late World War was an “act of God”. It was the work of the Devil, and those who see into the root causes of the war know that. Hence the great religious and spiritual uplift that it was predicted would come from the war has failed to materialize. You know what we have instead!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures do show, however, that God will yet bring one great evil, the greatest ever known, upon this earth. The book of Revelation, chapter sixteen, verse fourteen, calls it “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, and connects it up with what is “called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon”. In His prophecy on the end of the world, which is now fulfilling, Jesus pointed out that this great battle or evil will come no great while after our recent World War. He showed that between the close of the World War and the start of the battle of God Almighty “this gospel of the kingdom [of God] shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Students of the Bible, whose searching of the Scriptures Has brought them face to face with the fact that God’s kingdom is at hand and the great battle of Armageddon draws near, have keenly felt their obligation to preach the glad tidings of God’s kingdom to all nations for the consolation of the people; and they are doing so by means of radio and by millions upon millions of books in many languages, doing this on Sundays no less than on other days of the week. By this very work another part of Jesus’ prophecy is being fulfilled before the eyes of Christendom. It is a sure sign or visible proof to the people that the end is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus warned the readers of His prophecy to flee or insure themselves against the extreme trouble that would mark the final end, and told why, saying: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world, . . . no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” Thus Jesus spoke of the battle of that great day of God Almighty as the great tribulation such as would never rise up again on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God brings or creates this great evil, that is, He fights this decisive battle, for the vindication or setting right of His name, which has been -maligned and misreported by His enemies. His name stands for that which is true, right, holy, pure, beautiful, good, loving and just, and therefore the battle will be in behalf of righteousness and truth. In this battle, -will true Christians take up literal guns and swords and hand grenades and gas bombs and fight with them for God? No, positively no! God needs not men with carnal weapons to fight for Him. God’s people are commanded never to take up carnal weapons, but are under instructions to tell the people of God’s acts and of the setting up of the kingdom of His dear Son and also of the day of God’s vengeance against organized wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, then, will God fight against men? No! God’s great battle is against Satan and his organization. During the six thousand years in which Satan the Devil has had considerably free hand in the affairs of men, he has built up a pow’erful organization. In heaven he has drawn awrny many spirit creatures from the ways of God and led them to become demons and devils and to line up and organize under him as their prince. In earth he has overreached governments, business systems, arid popular religious systems, and has made them a part of his organization. This explains why the people have always waged a vain struggle, Satan’s organization has always been in the saddle on the people’s backs, and the invisible or heavenly part of that organization has always supervised and engineered the earthly part thereof ; and the people have futilely kicked and reared up and tried to unseat their cruel rider and driver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible calls this wicked organization “this world”. Jesus spoke of Satan as “the prince of this world”. Jesus and His apostles, and also the ancient prophets, spoke of the spiritual or demon part of that organization as “the heavens”, and of the earthly or human part of it as “the earth”. It is these heavens and earth that must pass away as though by a great fire, in order that the world to come, wfith its new heaven and new earth, may be established, and the poor, trouble-laden, crushed people may be freed and blessed with divine blessings unspeakable. Satan’s organization it is that must meet its end in the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and Jehovah God, with His great Son. “the captain of our salvation,” is He who gains the victory and exalts His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This great battle is now unavoidable. The people must go through it and bear up under it, for only by it will they be rid of the iniquitous organization of Satan and its malpractices. The Bible states frankly that because of failing to stand by God’s Word and to refrain from courting favor with the world the religious leaders are greatly responsible for the people’s suffering the painful experiences incidental to this battle. The prophet likens the battle to a whirlwind and says: “Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. The anger of the Lord shall not return, until.he have executed, and till he have performed'the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly. I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But</span><span class="font6"> if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.” (Jer. 23:19-22, 17) The great conflict being therefore unescapable now, the people must face it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This may sound like pessimistic or mournful news, for no doubt most of you have already been touched by the many sorrows of the world, and you long for righteousness and prosperity to rule the earth. But take heart: the Lord’s Word comfortingly points out that those of the people who now turn sincerely toward God and His way may find safety while the “great tribulation” such as never was is working ruin and destruction on the heavens and earth of Satan’s organization. Ages ago God moved His prophet Zephaniah (2:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3)</span><span class="font6"> to foretell the oncoming ■world trouble, and to say this: “Before the decree [of God] bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">-.......... When the prophet says: “Seek meekness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">seek righteousness,” it does not mean what the world popularly calls “righteousness” or “character development”. The world has been doused with this “character development” preachment for centuries now; and what has it accomplished for the world ? It has created a lot of snobbishness, self-righteousness, hypocrisy, and many “holier than thou” people, Worst of all, it has done away with faith in the blood of Christ Jesus as being the basis for acceptance with God and for eternal salvation. The scripture says: “For as by one man’s [Adam’s] disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one [Jesus Christ] shall many be made righteous.” (Rom. 5:19) Jesus said: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.” (Matt. 6:33) The righteousness men should seek, if they would be hid, is, therefore, faith in the atoning work of Jesus Christ and the acceptance of the message of God’s kingdom and the preparing of themselves for the setting up of that kingdom over this earth, and that within our generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psalm thirty-seven, verse eleven, states: “The meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.” Psalm twenty-five, verse nine, states: “The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way.” Hence the absolute need for meekness if one expects the Lord to hide him from disaster. Meekness does not mean weakness and permitting the cause of God’s truth to be stepped on without remonstrance, but it means teachableness toward God, and a willingness to learn from His Word and to do what one learns. God promises to guide such meek ones, and to them He extends hope of being hid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On a number of occasions God has shown His ability to hide certain ones in times of great disaster and havoc. In the days of that grand old man Noah the earth was filled with violence, and outside of Noah’s immediate family all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. This was the Devil’s foul work. The Bible calls that condition “the world that then was” (2 Pet. 3:6) or “the old world” or “the world of the ungodly”. To cleanse the earth and give mankind another righteous start God brought down the great deluge and washed away that wicked organization; but during the indescribable convulsion of nature in which that “old world” perished God securely hid Noah and his seven dear ones in the ark and preserved them and brought them into the new world which followed that greatest of flood catastrophes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sodom and Gomorrah were wicked cities, given over to the worship and deeds of the Devil. The Bible uses these two cities as a picture of Satan’s unrighteous earthly organization. Their destruction by fire and brimstone portrays in miniature how God will consume the great devilish organization which has filled the earth with iniquity and gross sin. Lot, the nephew of God’s faithful servant Abraham, was dwelling in Sodom, but in no wise in harmony with it. In the day of the burning of that city and its neighbor cities, God hid Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus has stated that at the end of this present evil world it would be as in the days of Noah and as at the time when Lot fled from Sodom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Relating how God hid His faithful servants amid the most destructive conditions, the Apostle Peter (2 Pet. 2:4-9) writes: “God . . . spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto them that after [ward] should live ungodly; and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; (for that righteous man. dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What God did back there in behalf of Noah and Lot, He knows how to do and has promised to do in behalf of those who seek meekness and righteousness now. Soon the great battle will begin in which those that oppose God’s cause and truth and the kingdom of His Son will not find a way to hide themselves, though they were to cry to the mountains and hills and rocks to fall upon them and to hide them from God’s just indignation against them.—Isa. 2:19-22; Rev. 6:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It wilhbe remembered, also, that in the closing statements of His prophecy on the end of the world or Satan’s organization, Jesus told a parable picturing how the people, particularly of Christendom, would be divided at the time of the setting up of His kingdom. Those who stubbornly resisted the message of the Lord’s kingdom and mistreated Christians who were proclaiming His kingdom, even to the point of having them arrested and cast into prison, the Lord compared to goats. The Lord held out no hopes of their coming out of the approaching battle of Armageddon alive, but strongly indicated that they would die with the Devil’s organization. Those, however, who sought meekness and righteousness and showed teachableness and willingness to receive the message of the kingdom which Christ’s brethren today are proclaiming to all nations, such meek and righteously-disposed ones the Lord compared to sheep, and upon them He pronounced God’s blessing, saying, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,... inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. . . . Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”—Matt. 25:34-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These sheep-like people, not Christians, mind you, but people who treat Christians (Christ’s brethren) kindly because they are proclaiming the glad tidings of God’s kingdom, such the Lord Jesus said would go “into life eternal”, this life being enjoyed, not in heaven, but on this earth over which the heavenly kingdom will rule. Let all people, then, even though not claiming to be Christians, turn from human systems unto the Lord’s kingdom now’, before the day of the “great tribulation” breaks over the world: “it may be,” says God’s Word, “it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” This will mean you ’will not have to go down into the grave and need to be raised therefrom in due time, but that you may survive to see Satan’s abominable organization dashed to pieces and God’s government put fully in charge of man’s interests, with “glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men”. In God alone is your safeguard, refuge, and security.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE case of People against William Evers, wherein the defendant 'was charged with going from house to house to solicit the sale of books without being licensed by the Town Clerk of the Towm of Hempstead in violation of the Town Law, Section 10, came on for hearing before Honorable Cortland A. Johnson, at Cedarhurst, N. Y., on the 30th day of April, 1931. Mr. Evers was represented by attorney, IL Willard Griffiths, of Hempstead, N. Y., who contended in his behalf that under the constitutions of the United States and the State of New York, he was entitled to observe his religion as he saw fit, in his owm way, and that the sale of the books of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association was a privilege that could not be denied to him as a citizen of the United States, and further, that under the Penal Code of the State of New York, the sale of books on Sunday was exempted from the operation of the law which prohibits the sale of general commodities on that day, and that as the International Bible Students Association, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and the Peoples Pulpit Association are all corporations either of a benevolent, charitable or religious character, they are not taxable, and that the exacting of a license from its colporteurs is not permissible under the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prosecution evidently felt the truth of these statements, as the case was dismissed without proof being adduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Anton Koerber, of Washington, D. C., regional director for the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, was present, as a witness in the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same questions involved in this case were involved in the case at Garden City some time ago, when several colporteurs were arrested, and the case was tried and dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Griffiths was the attorney representing the defendants in those cases, and the same points were involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the conclusion of the argument between Justice Johnson and Mr. Griffiths, Mr. Griffiths presented the judge with a copy of the book published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font6"> Mr. Griffiths said that he thought the judge would appreciate it when he had read it.

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE other evening, between 7: 00 and 7:15, walking down a long street, where there were many radios in use, one could almost keep step with the American people while they were at their usual devotions, the only ones that most of them have, i.e., Amos ’n’ Andy, and their Mouth Wash friend, who offers tooth paste and mouth wash by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We don’t like to do anything to upset anybody’s plans for selling several million dollars’ worth of mouth wash, but a subscriber tells us that an excellent one is made of a teaspoonful each of baking soda, borax and salt, well mixed.

<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Wliy This Phenomenal Distribution?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The reason is this: For centuries the common people have really wanted to understand the Bible, but the clergy have kept them in ignorance, superstition and darkness with their multitude of nonsensical creeds and man-made ceremonies. The spokesmen for organized religion openly admit that one of the main reasons they can continue is because “people are still superstitious”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, however, Judge Rutherford in his clear, concise explanation of the Bible is showing up the lies, misrepresentations and superstitions that the preachers have tried to cram into the heads of the unsuspecting and truth-hungry people. It is because he explains God’s Truth simply and logically, as outlined in the Bible, and because the people can understand this explanation, that Judge Rutherford’s books have attained such an unequaled distribution. Judge Rutherford speaks the truth boldly and absolutely free from creeds or sectarian restrictions. In ah his lectures he presents the Bible truth as authority for the facts and statements which he brings forth. You will like his clear and logical method in setting forth God’s purposes.</span></p>

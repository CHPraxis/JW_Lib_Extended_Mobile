<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark16"></a>A Study of Man as a Gregarious Animal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font6">REGARIOUS animals are those that habitually live or move in flocks or herds. Man is such an animal. It is not natural for men to live habitually solitary or alone. The life of a hermit does not appeal to most people. We involuntarily think there is something wrong with a hermit that he should wish to cut himself off from association with his fellows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the times in which we live, men and women, seem as never before bent on banding themselves together for every conceivable object under the sun. The old-style saloon vyas a sort of club of those who were especially fond of libation; but the modern night club, brought into being by the prohibition act. is all of that, and very much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that the night clubs of New York offer the only picture in history of bejeweled society women and girls, thugs, blackmailers, demimondaines, college boys and visiting business men on a spree, reveling night after night under the same roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The night clubs of New York are really associations of criminals or the criminally minded. These night clubs are regular resorts of criminals who watch for women with jewelry or men with money and follow<sup>7</sup> them when they leave and rob them or else blackmail them. As a matter of course, the managers of these night chibs are mostly men who have criminal records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high prices, music, dancing and eating and drinking carried on under the camouflage of exclusiveness are intended to draw into the clubs, and do draw into them in large numbers, those who come to New York “to see New York” and leave their morals behind them when they leave the old home towm for the big city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some, and perhaps all, of these night clubs have on their payrolls men whose business it is to beat into insensibility anyone who makes the mistake of visiting the club and fails to bring along enough money to pay the outrageous cover charges and assessments for refreshments. The New York papers often contain stories of men who have visited these night clubs and have received such treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus a young Harvard student visited one of these places with his brother and wanted to leave at 2:30 in the morning. The two young men found that their total cash was but $16.00, whereas the check they were expected to pay was for $25.55. Offers were made to make up the difference by a check, leaving jewelry as security, but to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The custom ivhich is usually followed in such cases was followed in this. The soft-spoken manager approached the table and suggested that the young men step into another room so that the matter might be quietly adjusted. Once out of sight of the crowd, the two were so badly beaten by three men. who later disappeared, that one of them could not come into court the next day; but though one of these men did appear in court with his face badly bruised, the court dismissed the charge against the manager of the night club when it was admitted that he had taken no part in the assault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Brooklyn, two night clubs were refused certificates of incorporation by the supreme court on the ground that their names, “Wild Cats Social and Athletic Club” and “Midnight Steppers Social Club”, were not suitable names for membership corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Order Clubs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are not as many clubs of those who have banded together to promote law and order as there are of those who are banded together to flout the law. Nevertheless there are those ■who are interested in seeing that something is done toward upholding the law. At Washington, the Thirty-Two Club, composed of senators, congressmen and other public officials, meets thirty-two times a year for breakfast and a game of golf. Meanwhile its members confer informally on important public questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1904 New York city has had a committee of fourteen which has devoted its efforts toward the suppression of commercialized prostitution. This committee finds that the night clubs and speak-easies furnish an overwhelming majority of such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Enfield, Conn., has an association for the detection of thieves and robbers. The Society has been in existence 105 years. When it was organized each member was required to keep a fast horse to give chase to thieves and robbers, and because that was the way thieves were caught a hundred years ago, the by-laws of the society remain the same as they were when it was founded. But now this society is, of course, merely a social institution, not greatly interested in the subject for which it was founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Missouri and other states in bygone years have had anti-horse-thief associations. At one time one of these associations had 45,000 members; but it no longer amounts to anything because, in the first place,'nobody has horses to steal; in the second place, nobody would steal them if they had; and in the third place, they would not know what to do with the horses after they stole them, the principal value of horses today being for “dried beef”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paris has an illegal association for the supposed rectification of legal sentences which appear to its members to be lax. In 1924, a certain Marquis Clement planned to ambush a Paris jeweler and shut him in a room into which chloroform was to have been pumped. The so-called “Knights of Themus”, who resented this and other robberies and swindles, buried this man Clement alive and placed a quantity of chocolate in the coffin in order to prolong his agonies. It seems incredible that men could do such a devilish tiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are thousands of leagues and clubs of those who are interested in preventing crime at its source, that is, in keeping the boys from going bad. Everybody has heard of the Boy Scouts and other boys' clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that it costs $2,000 to arrest, try and incarcerate a criminal, and after he is incarcerated, it costs $400 a year in taxes to keep him in a jail or reformatory; while a boys’ club, which may keep many youngsters out of trouble, takes care of its members for $15 a year each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a district in New York surrounding a boys’ club building at 301 East 52d Street, it was found that in thirteen years the boy delinquency ratio</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">in this district became the second lowest of Th fifteen areas studied. It is said that of 154 men serving life sentences as habitual criminals, more than half were under twenty-one when. .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">caught and none had ever been members of boys’clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn the borough of Manhattan, New York. .' within a five-year period, one-half of all the boys between the ages of ten and fifteen years will be registered on police blotters for some offense against law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Boston has a boys’ club composed exclusively of newsboys. The club was founded by a lawyer, once a newsboy, who desired to help newsboys bridge the great gap that exists between the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">street life of the newsboy and the future responsibilities of a useful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Detroit has noticed a marked decrease in de- ~ linquency cases since it organized a boys’ club, w.“ in which attention is given to their teeth and they are provided with recreation and every ... sort of gamQ that boys like. Boys will travel together; and if they do not travel under good leadership they will travel under bad, and eventually get into trouble. Detroit, some years ago. led all the cities of the country in juvenile delinquency, but is now making good progress in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Clubs for Mutual Improvement</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Girls in Chicago, Philadelphia, Buffalo and other places have organized “slow” clubs as a protest against the speed and recklessness of the jazz age. The girls in these clubs will bo careful when and where and how often they bestow their kisses. It would be good for all the girls in the country to remember this and live up to the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are nearly a thousand women's clubs in the country that own their own homes, the value of their holdings being nearly, if not ..... quite, $20,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Liverpool lias a husbands’ club, the 500 mem-hers of which have banded together for the right to stay away from home until 11:00 o’clock in the evening. Jersey City has an.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alimony Club, which in the last fifteen years , has paid in more than $166,000 in fees. These '.........</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fees, as prescribed by the court, are turned over to the wives of the members. New York has a similar alimony club.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is an association of American university women formed for the purpose of promot-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ing the welfare and advancement of college women. The Illinois Women’s Athletic Club has a baby check room in which youngsters are _.....cared for while their mothers find rest in ath</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">letics and such other things as women do in ‘ athletic clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Garden Club of America, said to have several hundred thousand members of beautyloving women, is crusading against the billboards that will spoil and are spoiling our scenery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a national association for middleaged employees, the object of which is to wipe out the rule against hiring men over forty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingsley Club of New York and Philadelphia is composed of stammerers. The purpose of the club is to correct stammering. At a recent meeting of the New York club, thirty members made speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paris has an Association of Kickers, the ob-jeet being that members should put up a vigorous complaint when prices appear to be too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Sanzovay is a club, not of deaf people, but of people who are not deaf, who are interested in helping the deaf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a club in Brooklyn, the Ship Model Makers Club, which boasts a membership of more than 1,000 engaged in that pursuit in many parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">..... ......Canada has an Amputation Club. This is an organization of men who lost arms and legs in the World War and seek to prevent the world from forgetting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that in the United States alone there are 450,000 persons who have joined Jack London clubs to protest against the cruelties connected with animal training. There are also Jack London clubs in Canada, England, Holland, Switzerland and France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">White Bear, Minn., has the Sons of Wild Jackasses Club, with a. charter membership of 200, with the avowed purpose of “braying for the fair treatment of farmers”. The name of this club refers to a speech by Senator Moses of New Hampshire, in which farmers of the Northwest were called by this unusual title.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London has a crime club to which lawyers and detectives belong. There is a Buttons Club, made up of bellhops. The Sick and Sorry Club is for those who do not. feel well and want to tell somebody about it. There is also in London a Sighing Club, which lovers join and in which they can talk as much as they like about the objects of their affection. London also has a Split Farthing Club, which, in fact, is an association of misers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Health Clubs, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germany has a Avalking club of 85,000 members that has in connection with it 2,300 tourists’ homes where lodging and breakfast can be had for a few cents. Germany also has, in Berlin, a Turnverein, or exercise club, exclusively for babies less than a year old. Here the youngest exercisers in the world range from five months to a year, are laid out on flannel-covered tables and put through setting up exercises with a view to correcting defects of the spine, which have been discovered in about one-fourth of the school children in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London has a Grandfathers’ Club of fifteen members who spend their annual two weeks’ vacation together. In the last party the oldest was eighty-four and the youngest seventy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Montgomery County, Penna., has a club of 6,000 people, membership in which is limited to those persons who have dwelt for fifty years or more in that one county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coney Island, New York city, has a Polar Bear Club, consisting of robust citizens who bathe in the open in the Atlantic, the year round. Like the Germans of Caesar’s day, the Polar Bears take their morning swims even when they have to break the ice in order to get into the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Cloud Club of New York is an organization of business men who procure their luncheons on the 66th, 67th and 68th floors of the Chrysler Building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London has a Beefsteak Club, and there are many epicure clubs in all parts of the world. In the South, the colored people have watermelon clubs. The star performer in one of these watermelon clubs is said to have eaten three full-grown melons in six minutes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">THE ALUMINUM GRAFT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some time ago a “news release” was sent out from the North Dakota Agricultural College, stating that aluminum cooking utensils were perfectly safe and that there was no danger of poison. This release was published in the small-town weeklies throughout the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Investigation has shown that the big trusts are deluging the press with “news releases” and “canned editorials” and boasts of the amount of free space for the trusts. One of their agents declared that country editors are “God’s fools”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every week there comes to our desk one of these “news releases” from a news distributing service, run by E. M. Hofer &amp;&nbsp;Sons, Portland, Oregon, and, as usual, boosting the big power trusts and knocking public ownership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation it was found that the power corporations had been secretly giving $84,000 a year to the above-mentioned E. M, Hofer &amp;&nbsp;Sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hofer service, distributed free to 14,000 newspapers throughout the country, is a disgraceful fraud and cheat perpetrated upon the editors and newspaper readers of the country, and the recent case of the North Dakota Agricultural College, denying that aluminum cooking utensils are poisonous, shows that they arc not without dirty hands; but what does a life mean to some college professors as long as they can fill their coffers?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">ILL some mathematician explain just what is the difference in principle between the utilities company’s service charges against the small users of gas, water, and electric current, and the $1 monthly service charge of the National Bankers Association against the small depositor whose monthly balance is less than $100? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be sure, &quot;infant industries” always had to be favored, and now that banks and railroads are in the infant business class they should be protected against departmental loss even if the man with less than $100 must donate 12 percent to 24 percent of his all to those who have nine-tenths of the nation’s cash outside of government vaults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Government, municipal, state, national, and other full-grown enterprises transfer funds from one department to another to provide and care for just such deficiencies. However, doubtless the banks need the few extra dollars of the small depositor, to stack up in their already over-filled vaults, to save the crumbling banking and financial system of the country’ from total collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Senator Couzens’ suggestion, that &quot;capitalism ought to clean its house”, is well supplemented in “The Soliloquy of a Wyoming Banker”, as we read in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> of June 24.

Will he lead the way, forgive and forget, by? rescinding, and cause the rescinding of all war debts, and lay a sound foundation for all countries ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">zen of the United States was entitled to the equal protection of the law. Freedom of speech and of the press were guaranteed. No man could be arrested without a warrant. No home or place of business could be invaded by police or sheriff without a search warrant under bond. The citizen could not be deprived of life, liberty or property without “due process of law”. This meant trial by jury before a court of competent jurisdiction, with power to summon witnesses, to compel their testimony, and to punish for contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today all these matters are obsolete. Our government has deteriorated into an administrative despotism, the most despotic, criminal and corrupt of all the governments of the so-called civilized world. Our governments both state and national are administered strictly upon the principles of graft. The individual or the business which does not or cannot “pay off” loses in any proceeding. The “Bill of Rights” is a joke. The Constitution of the United States is a “scrap of paper”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to facilitate the collection of graft and to give it a legal status, the Congress of the United States has passed laws creating various boards, commissions and bureaus, granting them great powers with no legal restraint or accountability and with no trial by jury. Among these laws are the Pure Food and Drugs Act, the Volstead Act, the creation of the Federal Trade Commission, the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Radio Commission, the Farm Board, and many others. The state legislatures have created highway commissions, school commissions, health boards, employees’ compensation commissions, public utilities commissions, and many others. All these commissions have been created for the purpose of facilitating the collection of graft and avoiding trial by jury. Appeals from their decisions are by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">certiorari </span><span class="font6">and do not grant a trial </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">de novo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These various boards and commissions are in close affiliation with certain private or extra-governmental organizations which cooperate with them in the collection of graft. These organizations enjoy the favor of the public press and through the press conduct that other menace to American law and liberty, that is, government by propaganda and not by law. Two conspicuous extra-governmental organizations in our country, organized, conducted and financed by graft, are the Better Business bureaus and the American Medical Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The National Better Business Bureau has its headquarters in New York city, with branches in all the larger cities of the United States. Its graft has become so burdensome that the business houses of New York have organized a protective association to counteract its racketeering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American Medical Association has its headquarters in Chicago, with subsidiaries in every state and in a vast majority of the counties in the United States. It is credited with being the best organized and most powerful extra-governmental grafting organization in the United States. In its graft it is directly affiliated with the national government. It controls the United States Public Health Service, the health departments of the army and navy, the narcotic division, the bureau of chemistry, and the fraud order office of the Post Office Department. In the states it controls medical education, medical licensure, school inspection, and all public hospitals. In large measure it is affiliated with the Federal Radio Commission in the exacting of graft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very sources of justice have been corrupted. Did you ever visit a district court of the United States? To persons accustomed to the decencies and amenities of life, a visit to the district court of the United States will be a shock. But if he will visit the Moulin Rouge, Le Chat Noir, and the haunts of the Apaches in Paris, and then go with Kipling to Suez, Port Said, Aden and Singapore, then come back and attend the night court in the Lower Bast Side in New’ Y<sup>7</sup>ork, make a tour of Chinatown in San Francisco and of the West Side in Chicago, he will be prepared in a measure for the further descent into the District Court of the United States. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Facilis descensus Averno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The officials, including the judge, the frequenters and the audience, smoke cigarettes until the atmosphere of the court room is a cloudy haze. The court room, halls and corridors are filled ’with bootleggers, racketeers, hijackers, deputy marshals, come-on men, snoopers, procurers, under-cover men, inspectors, assistant district attorneys, stool pigeons, perjurers, decoys, demimondaines, and all that ruck of the underworld that are supposed to add dignity to our federal courts. In this court the most serious offense is to be a law-abiding citizen of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three of these great grafting institutions keep a special watch upon the business of the country, the Better Business bureau, the American Medical Association and the Federal Trade Commission. When a business seems to be successful and prosperous and able to pay off, it is approached by the Better Business bureau. If it refuses to pay off, the Better Business bureau issues a printed pamphlet denouncing the business as a fraud and sends this pamphlet to affiliated Better Business bureaus in all the large cities of the United States and to the press. Letters are sent to the newspapers and magazines warning them not to accept the advertising of the proscribed business. Often libelous pretended biographies of the officers and representatives of these business concerns are added to the propaganda. If this pressure does not succeed in compelling the proscribed business to pay off to the Better Business bureau, the matter is turned over to the Federal Trade Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Federal Trade Commission issues a citation to the business organization to come to Washington to show cause why an order to “cease and desist” business should not be issued by the Commission. This is merely a suggestion to pay off. The Commission suggests that the'matter can be arranged “by stipulation”. They may even send a copy of their last annual report, calling attention to the hundreds of cases settled by “stipulation”. But they never state how much, or how they divided the swag, or how much, if any, they turned into the treasury of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the prospective victim decides to settle “by stipulation” and sends in $25,000, a very satisfactory stipulation can be written. There are five commissioners. If one or two hundred cases are settled “by stipulation” in a year, this nets quite a tidy sum. The racketeering practices of the Better Business bureau are enforced by a form of law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the business cited is refractory and insists on a hearing, there is no amount of evidence that wall avail anything. The most complete and sweeping proof that a business is honest, fair and wholly lawful amounts to nothing lie-fore the Commission in default of the “pay off”. The record is useful only on appeal to the court above. Property is confiscated and the business</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ruined without a trial by jury and without compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a pharmaceutical manufacturer, a great drug firm, an organization of physicians, a hospital, or any other organization having a medical tendency or purpose, fails to get permission to operate from the American Medical Association, that is, does not “pay off” to North Dearborn Street, Chicago, the matter is turned over to the Federal Trade Commission. The same procedure follows. Citation, pay off, or trial with the inevitable adverse decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• The above statements are mild. For real vigorous language in the statement of the case, we quote the opinion of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, No. 5429, filed June 28, 1930, entitled “The Marmola Case”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The record here shows, without dispute or by implication which would hardly be denied, that the American Medical Association is engaged in a campaign against those proprietary remedies which it believes ought to be used by the public cither not at all or only under supervision. It lias a bureau for that and other purposes, and the bureau employs a director. When it is thought that a particular advertisement should be stopped, this director takes the matter up with the Commission and with the association of “Better Business Bureaus” which are scattered over the country. Thereupon, the Commission, if it approves, files a complaint and eventually, if it is convinced of the truth of its complaint, makes the order to desist and refrain. The Better Business bureaus explain to their local newspapers and to the general periodicals, that it would be wise to refuse this advertising. The chairman of the Commission, iu public addresses, and in correspondence, advises </span><span class="font3">die </span><span class="font4">newspapers that they will be subject to prosecution by the Commission as defendants, to be joined with the advertisers, if they do not desist from such publications; and the newspapers may suspect that if they do not comply with the advice of the Better Business bureaus, their general advertising patronage from the membership of these bureaus will fall off. It appears that these methods of influence, carried on in this case before this cross suit for enforcement was commenced and while it has been pending, have destroyed a large part of petitioner’s business through refusal to accept this advertisement, and only the injunction of this court is needed to make the elimination complete. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be noted that tins most nefarious, most vicious and far-reaching combination is against the practices of medicine and pharmacy. We, as physicians, are vitally concerned and largely responsible, for we have permitted this octopus to grow in our midst until it threatens to strangle our very life. It is up to us to clean house in our own profession. The condition has become so rotten and so vile that the house-cleaning devolves upon us. The rest of the world has abandoned us to our fate and turned to other sources of relief. Heaven revolts at the corruption. We must do the work. Our prayers are not answered, for the gates of Heaven are closed to keep out the stench of Fishbrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is much easier and safer to frame some inoffensive, unoffending, law-abiding citizen than it is to apprehend and prosecute a gangarmed with machine guns. So when business is dull and publicity is lacking, and it seems necessary to get on the front page, the United States district attorney calls in two assistants, a half dozen inspectors and a gang of stool pigeons, procurers, decoys and perjurers and proceeds to frame some law-abiding citizen. The higher the standing and character of the accused, the greater the publicity. Pictures in the papers, long accounts of the trial and sensational but false accusations furnish the necessary thrill. A law-abiding citizen of the United States is convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary to the scandal of the community, while gangsters run wild, bootleggers and racketeers flourish and murder and rapine go unpunished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last few years furnish many concrete examples of the utter break-down of law in our country. Of late we read much about the Fall case. Several years ago Fall and Doheny were indicted about a $100,000 bribe. Doheny was accused of giving the bribe, and Fall of accepting it. On trial Doheny was acquitted by a jury. Now the acceptance of a bribe is dependent upon a bribe’s being given. If a bribe is not given, it cannot be accepted. To any judge or lawyer with any judicial acumen and with sufficient horse sense to come in out of the rain, the acquittal of Doheny should have worked an automatic dismissal of the charge against Fall. Yet Fall was tried by politics rather than by law, was convicted of receiving a bribe that was not given, and has been sent to the penitentiary. Is it any wonder that our boasted United States is the-joke of the civilized world? ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For ten years Al Capone and his organization have been shipping alcohol and other intoxicating liquors by the carload throughout the length and breadth of the United States. Federal agents have ridden these trains, followed this liquor to its destination, supervised its distribution and collected their divide of the profits. Recently it was decided that Capone was to be prosecuted. Popular clamor was so great that it had to be done. With all this information, he was only sued for his income tax! Recent reports indicate that the Federal authorities are unable to locate the Capone millions and cannot collect the income tax. While Capone was supposed to be in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, he and one hundred of his friends, the gentlemen in Tuxedos and the ladies in evening gowns, invaded the banquet hall in a hotel in Benton Harbor, Michigan, where some sorority was holding a banquet, took possession of the hall, crowded out the sorority and forced them to seek smaller quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few days later Capone appeared with counsel before the judge of the district court of the United States in Chicago. His counsel had bought the attorney general of the United States and the district attorney in Chicago. They presented an agreement that Capone should plead guilty to some of the minor charges and receive a short-time sentence and a light fine. But they had overlooked an important matter. They had not “seen” the judge who had the last word. When the agreement was presented to him, his indignation was something wonderful to behold. With gavel, judicial dignity and official denunciation, he humbled counsel and Capone and his counsel and made them doubly conscious of their oversight and lack of consideration of the dignity of his court. They withdrew the plea and took a continuance of a month or two. This 'will give them ample time to “see” the judge. $25,000 to $50,000 will be a wonderful prop to judicial dignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year while the Federal Radio Commission was indulging its orgy of corruption and its attempted graft in Kansas, affairs were very quiet in the federal district court at Kansas City, Kansas. It was decided to secure some publicity, so a quiet officer in the medical service of the United States Army, a certain Major Shepherd, was selected as the victim. He was framed out of whole cloth. After weeks of trial, front page stuff, crowded court rooms, pictures in the papers, scandal and salacious stuff sufficient to satiate the crowds of ladies who attended the trial, he was convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to the penitentiary for life. The Government did not even prove the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">corpus delicti.</span><span class="font6"> The two facts proven beyond question were that the Government of the United States maintained at Fort Riley a Post bootlegger and a Post gold digger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A vast system of Government graft which has extended over a number of years is just reaching its consummation. The scheme covers three major operations, the development of Florida lands, the development of the Rio Grande valley<sup>7 </sup>and the building of the Bagnell dam. All were undertaken by private enterprise with private capital. They were risky<sup>7</sup>; the outcome was problematical. In each case the business arrived at an impasse. There was question of success. This juncture in each case was being anticipated by<sup>7</sup> the office of the attorney general of the United States and by his assistant district attorneys. Other private capital was associated with the attorney general in the scheme. At this juncture in each case, federal investigations, and prosecutions were instituted for the purpose of shaking public confidence, causing a panic of shareholders, the depreciation of the values of securities, and driving the concerns into bankruptcy and receiverships. .When conditions were at their worst in each case, the other financial concerns which were “in on.” the scheme came in and bought up the depreciated stocks and bonds, got control of the lands and improvements already made for a fraction of their original cost, added their own capital and brought them to completion. Millions were lost to the original promoters and their investors. In each case the steal was gigantic. It was all accomplished by the forms of law. It could not have been done without the cooperation of the Department of Justice of the Government of the United States. The divide or rake-off of the Department of Justice has never been determined. The last of these schemes to be consummated is the Bagnell dam in Missouri. This was accomplished by the district attorney in Kansas City, in engineering the wrecking of the Land Bank at Kansas City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year the Federal Radio Commission has indulged in an orgy of legalized graft. By law it is granted the unconstitutional power of refusing the use of the air. Intoxicated with this power, it inaugurated and prosecuted a regime of confiscation and oppression unparalleled in the history of this country<sup>7</sup> and without precedent in the civilized world. Independent radio broadcasting stations not belonging to the “radio trust” vrere cited to show cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">why they should not be denied a renewal of their license. Besides numerous minor eases, there have been two very conspicuous cases, and a third is now pending. The two conspicuous cases are notable from the fact that they were partly owned by physicians or were asso-...... dated with large and important hospitals not affiliated with the American Medical Association. These two hospitals were progressive and successful and supplied a great and popular need. But they would not pay off, first, to the American Medical Association and, second, ^to &quot;&nbsp;the Federal Radio Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">_........The first of these broadcasting stations to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">cited was the station at Milford, Geary county, Kansas. It was owned, controlled and operated</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">....... by a company in which Dr. John R. Brinkley - was prominent. Dr. Brinkley is a surgeon of J............splendid education and of superior ability. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">g incurred the enmity of the American Medical ..... Association. .His station was of 5,000 watts power, and was the most popular in the United States. Its programs were educational, refined, chaste and religious. A station owned and operated by the Kansas City </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> at Kansas City, Mo., had 1000 watts power. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> determined to put the Milford station out of business. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font6"> and the American Medical Association</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J., procured the Federal Radio Commission to issue a citation against the Milford station. It A v&gt;<sup>7</sup>ould not pay off, and went to trial. The affidavits offered before the Federal Radio Commission in Washington in May, 1930, went into ___ the record as prepared and offered by the Kan-J sas City </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span><span class="font6"> They were proven false. The defense was overwhelming in character and in ■ numbers of witnesses and affidavits. But the necessary $25,000 was not forthcoming. The station was denied its license. Then the Radio Commission decided to punish the state of Kansas for its defense of Dr. Brinkley and of the favorite radio station of the state, by denying the signature and wave length of the Milford sta-lion to Kansas. The legislature of Kansas i arose in open, unanimous revolt and instructed j...... the governor to use the utmost power of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">state to keep the station in Kansas. So the governor sent the entire congressional representai tion of Kansas, the senators and the vice-president to President Hoover demanding that their ! favorite radio station be left in their state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the direction of one of the Kansas congressmen, thousands of letters were sent to President Hoover. The writer sent one of these let-■f’.....</span></p>

The people of Kansas arose in political revolt. At the November election Senator Henry J. Allen, who did not support Dr. Brinkley, was defeated. Dr. Brinkley was elected governor of Kansas by a large plurality but was counted out by the constituted authorities sworn to enforce the law. The suffrage of the citizen is one of the most sacred rights. The people of Kansas are impatient of oppression and are still in open political revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second hospital radio station to come under the ban is KTNT, of Muscatine, Iowa. It was a very popular station, and was denied its license because of the opposition of the American Medical Association. The hospital is one of the largest and most successful in the treatment of cancer. The radio station was very popular, next to the Milford station the most popular in the middle west. But it did not belong to the radio trust and would not pay off to the American Medical Association or to the Federal Radio Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The station at Shreveport, Louisiana, is now under the threats of the Federal Radio Commission. Thus far it has not paid off. It is a veiw popular station and is operated in the interest of the public. It has been very independent, and would have been put off the air long ago if it had not had the solid support of the congressional representation from Louisiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Radio stations costing $100.00!) to $150,000 have been confiscated without trial by court or jury, without any process of condemnation or compensation. A radio station can be used for only one purpose. Deprived of the right to use the air, the finest radio station is a pi Ie of junk. Yet these outrages and corrupt practices have become commonplace. The action of the Federal Radio Commission amounts to confiscation of the radio receiving sets in our homes. There are still some homes of education, refinement and culture. Some of these homes have children and young people whose minds should not be debauched by the vile stuff now sent over the radio with the approval of the Radio Commission. They say, “Yon don’t have to listen; shut off your radio.” We do shut it off, but would like at limes to listen to something beautiful, chaste and refined. As it is, most of the time is taken up with the advertising of corn salve. tooth paste, cigarettes and home brew, interspersed with jazz and a species of variety show that would be hissed off the stage in the Bowery.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark29"></a>On the Nature and Origin of Life </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By G. Lester Lance (California</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE genesis of life on our planet is often called “the greatest of the unsolved problems confronting man”. Indeed we are given to understand that the problem is incapable of solution. An eminent scientist declares that “as for the origin of life we know nothing whatever. Speculation about it is more or less futile.” Another remarks that “biologists are, at the present time, absolutely unable, and probably will be for all time unable, to obtain empirical evidence on any of the crucial questions relating to the origin of life”. While upon these points there is a divergence of opinion, an inquiry into the various theories respecting the origin of life opens many avenues of thought and matters of peculiar interest. Such an investigation may not enrich our knowledge to any great extent, but it may serve to impress the mind with the fact that leading men in the world of science today do not have a monopoly of, or even an intimate acquaintance with, all the facts of Nature as some of their learned treatises imply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mystery of the origin of life is no greater than the phenomena of life itself. The problem of life-genesis can hardly be considered apart from the question, What is life&quot;? Supposedly this is a question for the biologist. Many definitions have been given, but none have proved quite satisfactory. Life has been defined as “the sum of the functions that resist death”. Spencers definition, familiar to all biologists, is that ........“life is the definite combination of heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, coordinated into correspondence with external coexistences and sequences”. Again, life is said to be “a series of definite and successive changes, both of structure and composition, which take place within an individual without destroying its identity”. These definitions are extremely interesting and give a working basis for further thought and study, but they are far from satisfactory. While a definition in terms so precise that it can be used as an invariable criterion is desirable, to state one thus is a problem of considerable difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Life is generally defined by modern biologists by its effects and in terms of mechanical or chemical principles. But no complete mechanization of biological phenomena is possible, and all mechanico-chemical explanations of living processes are bound to prove extremely unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be pointed out that the mechanistic </span><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u </span><span class="font6">theory of life is inadequate in many particulars. One instance often mentioned is in regard to locomotion. If you wind up a child’s toy automobile and set it going toward a wall, it will strike the wall and rebound in the same line in which it approached. When the energy of the rebound is exhausted, the energy of the spring will operate again and the machine will again strike the wall. This operation will continue until the spring is unwound and the energy is exhausted. Such is mechanical behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Scientists have taken living organisms and have tried an experiment strangely like the performance of the toy automobile. They have taken thousands of Paramecium (a microscopic protozoan) and put them in one part of a glass bowl, and -at the other end of the bowl some food. In the middle of the bowl they placed a glass partition, open at both ends. Using a microscope the Paramecium were observed moving forward in a straight line in the same manner as the toy automobile. When they hit the glass they came back in a straight line, but swerved, and then moved diagonally toward the glass, hit it, and swerved again in the same direction as before. They might just as well have swerved left as right, according to the law of chance, but they kept moving or shifting in the same direction until they got around the edge of the partition. Here is an instance of the inadequacy of mechanical principles to explain organic behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The regenerative and readaptive power of life is demonstrated in an overwhelming manner by the process of reproduction. Can it be supposed that any machine of whatever kind could isolate a. small part of itself as a sort of model machine, corresponding to a sperm or ovum, which could meet with another model machine of similar kind, unite with it, and produce a third machine that would grow and continue the process'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That all forms of life have a mechanical or chemical basis is beyond question; but when an analysis is applied to living phenomena we are compelled to think of some force or principle in addition to the matter it animates. The physical and chemical forces of inorganic nature must be supplemented with another or different force. Yet here we must reason carefully. We do not understand that life is an entity: there is no such thing as life in the abstract. Life has no existence apart or separate from concrete living substances or living organisms. Though students of biophysics and of biochemistry today are penetrating many of the secrets of life, its mystery still remains. Hence the scientific conception of the adequacy of mechanico-chemical forces to explain all biological processes must remain unsatisfactory to philosophical minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is sometimes said that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font6"> is not a concrete reality, but merely an abstract term used to indicate a condition of matter. Such an assertion is self-destructive; for to deny the reality of life is to assert the unreality of mind. When the concrete reality of matter is affirmed and the reality of mind is denied the question arises, What are we going to do with the mind that makes such an assertion? How can the reality of matter be affirmed if the reality of that which affirms it be denied? Or, how can mind be declared an unreality when it is the mind that makes the assertion? Mind or consciousness is real, but belongs to a different order of reality than matter. We know mind only as a subjective reality, whereas we know matter as an objective reality. Now while it is true, as some will contend, that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mind</span><span class="font6"> is only a name for the complex physicochemical processes in the brain substance, the term obviously embraces something more: that something which understands and names these processes. Can a physicochemical process paint a picture or write a scientific treatise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a world of difference between a rock and a rose or between a man and the soil at his feet! The hiatus between dead, inert matter and living forms is a wide one. The distinctive properties of living matter are several. Living matter consists of a special organization of certain chemical elements called &quot;protoplasm”, and the organizational unit of all living matter is the cell. Since protoplasm in cellular arrangement is found in all living things, either animal or vegetable, it may be called as Huxley termed it, “the physical basis of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dual process, or metabolism, goes on in protoplasm by which it is partially consuming and building continually. This continual waste and repair, or the anabolic and katabolic processes, force themselves upon our attention chiefly as growth, that interplay and interchange between the organism and its environment called intussusception. In the anabolic process repair and growth of the individual are brought about, and when overgrowth occurs the result is repro</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">duction or the production of another individual. Protoplasm grows: cells grow, and having attained a certain size, reproduce by dividing into two more or less equal parts, Every living organism reacts to its environment, and an advantageous conformation to changes in its surrounding conditions becomes an adaptation. Thus, lexicographically stated, the three principal distinctions of life are (1) metabolism with the power of growth, (2) reproduction, and (3) adaptation to changes in the environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Life has not always been present on the earth. Most scientists admit that it must have had a beginning. Some, however, unable to solve .the. mystery of its origin, declare that life has been in existence from eternity; i. e., that it had no beginning but, like' matter and energy, has always existed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most striking theories to explain life-genesis suggests an extra-terrestrial origin. Certain scientific philosophers assume that the germs of life drifted to the earth from other spheres as a slowly falling -cosmic dust propelled through space by the radiant energy of light. Others assume that the transmitting agency has been meteorites, thousands of which reach our atmosphere daring every twenty-four hours. It was recently announced before the National Academy of Sciences that living bacteria had been discovered deep inside rocks estimated to be over two hundred million years old. This, it is claimed, points to the possibility of the original spark of life having reached the earth lodged inside a fragment of rock from the vast depths of outer space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the theory of the foreign importation of life encounters special difficulties when the factors of cold and heat, as well as time, are taken into consideration. One wonders how any organic substance could enduro the extreme cold of interstellar space; or how it could withstand the terrific heat of meteorites that fall to the earth, for they reach a high temperature in passing through the atmosphere. One scientist, remarks on the transmission of life-germs through the agency of meteorites that “the time... limit is also a factor, for it has been calculated that one hundred and fifty years would be required to cover the distance from the nearest planet, and sixty million years from the nearest stellar system”. On the suggestion that the germs of life came to earth as cosmic dust through solar energy or other celestial agency,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">this same scientist further remarks respecting the time element that “this is a very distinct ~ gain over the meteorite flight, for now Mars is :only eighty days away, while the nearest stellar sa stem is but nine thousand years”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The theory ■ of the extra-mundane origin of <sup>7</sup> life is merely a refuge from certain geological, ■ biological, and philosophical difficulties, and on’ ly removes the problem of life-genesis farther i . away without solving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did life arise spontaneously out of dead mat</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ter? In the face of the scientific evidence they - have thoroughly logical biologists cannot admit <sup>;</sup> spontaneous generation. On the other hand, since they reject the theory of “special creation” ■ they cannot explain how life could have originated in any other way excepting through some y sort of transformation from inorganic matter. <sup>7</sup>&quot; So today many biologists hold, though some’ what vaguely, to the theory of a primitive and f slow spontaneous generation. But abiogenesis ; is untenable, not only as an explanation of life X?. processes noAv in progress, but of the beginning of life as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">....... The biological unit is the cell, and it is said that the cell is only a more complex form of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> more primitive living matter. But try as he will, the biologist, as he goes down the scale toward the inorganic, cannot find the point where the living and the non-living meet and become one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' Spencer maintained that the organic and the inorganic fade into each other by insensible gradations. He affirmed that it is not necessary for us to think of a “first organism”, an “absolute commencement” of life; that organic matter was not all produced at once, but was reached by steps or gradations. But the question arises, How can there be any gradations or degrees between being and not being, between something and nothing? The theory provides a philosophi-___ cal bridge across the gulf, but it lacks adequate support. It was necessary to his purpose; for V.. any other conception would negative his whole scheme of universal evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Scientists who advocate evolution as a scheme of the universe must necessarily hold to some form of primordial arehebiosis in order to make</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' their scheme complete. No system of cosmic or universal evolution is complete without some such theory. Consistency demands that the . causal sequence be unbroken. But evidence for abiogenesis is wholly lacking, both in the labo-<sup>7</sup> ratory of the scientist and in Nature. With all the tremendous resources of science at their command evolutionists today cannot produce life from lifeless matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes the question is asked, Since scientists claim to know all the ingredients that make up a man, why do they not combine the elements in the proper way and produce a man? or at least a blade of grass? When questions of this kind are asked, evolutionists at once take refuge in the statement that such a challenge leaves out of consideration two important factors, namely, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">evolution.</span><span class="font6"> They claim that ‘Nature took millions of years to produce a blade of grass, and many more millions of years to make man, in a step-by-step process’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But some, of course, will go so far as to declare it their conviction (to quote a reputed scientist) that ‘five have gone a long way toward understanding the composition of an amoeba and I don’t believe that it will be any million years, or even fifty years, before . . . we can build a single-cell organism like the amoeba. It is not proven, but nevertheless I firmly believe that if the necessity arises, we will grow men in test tubes from the ordinary chemical units now on the shelves of our laboratories, plus a very much more accurate knowledge of physi-cochemistiw than we possess at the present time.” Such statements by reputed scientists can best be explained in terms of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">egotism</span><span class="font6"> and obviously are not based upon the results of scientific research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So with an assumed air of superior knowledge evolutionists boldly put forth the claim that “life came into being on our planet . . . by the action of physicochemical laws, through what we call spontaneous generation, the materials for the formation of the first bit of living protoplasm being ready at hand”. When evolutionists advance abiogenesis as an explanation of the origin of life they merely cut the knot instead of untying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is claimed by evolutionists that the living things today are actual lineal descendants in an unbroken series of a few essentially simple forms, or possibly from one. By some the name “protobion”, meaning the first living being, is used as the name of the first organism. The probable geographical location where life first originated is said to be the polar regions, particularly the north pole. Some, however, declare that this theory is without the slightest scientific evidence. Other speculative minds suggest that life may have appeared simultaneously in different parts of the globe as soon as the superheated planetary mass became sufficiently cooled to permit the formation of primeval seas. But all these theories are merely fantastic speculations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only reasonable theory to account for the genesis of life on the earth is that it was created by a Supreme Intelligent Creator. Only by direct act of creation can the barrier between the living and the non-living be crossed, id an cannot produce life except by antecedent life. No life ever arises except under the direct influence of preexisting living matter. Therefore, when life was first introduced on the earth it was by a direct act of creation. This is the plain statement of Divine Revelation: “In the beginning God created-.” Life is an energizing principle which inheres in God, and it originally appeared on the earth in many forms by the exercise of His creative power, and in accordance with the divine will. Jehovah God is the one great source of life, and upon His creative power and conditions which He has ordained depend all His creatures for their existence, whether they be higher spirit intelligences, or man, or the lowest form of animate being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is outside the province of this article to discuss the “origin of species”. Lack of space (that much used excuse for laziness) forbids such discussion here. Suffice it now to say that life doubtless was created </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in many diversified forms</span><span class="font6"> in the beginning, and not as one or several tin}' organisms called “protoplasm”. From these diversified forms, in unbroken continuity, though with constant modification or variation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">within definite groups,</span><span class="font6"> caused by many factors,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">came the present species w-hich make up the animal and plant kingdoms (man, of course, being excepted). The popular theory of organic evolution is not supported by scientific or demonstrable facts or by the Word of God ; and ““t this statement applies, not only to the descent of man, but to the descent of present species of plants and animals from one or several primitive forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In their haste and determination to discard &quot;&nbsp;the idea of a Supreme Intelligent Creator present-day savants are walling to accept or subscribe to the most apparent contradictions, and consequently wander in circles. God is the Author of the book of Nature as well as the book of Divine Revelation, but if any attempt is made to bring God or the truths of His Word “ into correlation with the facts of natural science it is either at once condemned or consistently ignored by these self-constituted wise men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">OLD superstitions die hard. Indeed, they have to be repeatedly killed. There is an old medical superstition, born in the early days of Egyptian black magic, which seems destined to live forever. At least age does not seem to impair its vigor. I refer to the superstition that disease can be cured; that is, that there are remedies which restore health without removing or correcting the causes of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 310, (Aug. 5), is an item on “Uses of Slippery Elm Bark”, by Mrs. Joseph Levens, of Indiana, in which she recounts some “cures” of “incurable” cases by the use of this thaumaturgic method. We even learn that this magic bark will prevent the pains of childbirth: pains that are due to gross unnatural living and to malnutrition in early years, resulting in faulty development. It will be curing withered hands the next time we hear from it. Testimonials of benefits derived from “remedies” mean nothing, whether coming from ignorant savages, Indian medicine men (shamans), or from some one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I stick my hand into the fire I shall get burned; and no slippery elm bark or other magic potency will prevent me from being burned. There is nothing that will heal the burn except the forces and processes inherent in the body itself. Cell renewal and cell multiplication is the process of healing, and the only thing that can bring this about is proper nutrition. Salves and ointments will not and cannot do it. If I keep burning my finger and do not give it an opportunity to heal by removing the cause of the burn (the fire), no “remedy” will “cure” the burn. If the cause is removed, no </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">remedies</span><span class="font6"> are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I mash my finger it will heal up in a few days by virtue of the body’s own powers of self-repair. But if I tie the finger up with salves and ointments and continue to mash it, it will never heal. Cause must be corrected or removed. When this is done, recovery follows and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">remedies</span><span class="font6"> are not needed.</span></p>

We call in the Christian Scientist, the New Thoughtist, or go to Elmer Gantry or Aimee Semple McPherson to have our disease chased away by their brands of bunk. But we never give up our bad habits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find doctors of all the above schools smoking tobacco, drinking alcoholic drinks, even getting drunk, and violating all the laws of life in every way they can and telling their patients that they may do likewise. Why should doctors and patients obey the laws of life so long as there is an Abrams box or a Pathoclast to remove ail the effects of wrong living while the Vvrong living continues? The ancient prescription to “go and sin no more” (sin meaning transgression of the law) was never popular. Black magic prescriptions’ of all kinds are preferred. We would rather have a witch-broth in the form of slippery elm tea, when we suffer, than to cease doing those things that cause our suffering. Gluttons do not reform their eating habits: they take dyspepsia tablets and have their spines punched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inebriate wants a cure for the effects of drinking that will allow him to continue drinking; the sensualist wants a gland extract, a serum or a Voronoff operation that will restore potency to him while he continues his sensuous overindulgence; the glutton seeks relief from his practice in Bell-ans or baking soda. None of them desire to reform their modes of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The professed Christian proves his faith in God by having his tonsils removed, because the surgeon knows and God did not. Most Christians (?) are atheists and are wedded to the Egyptian black magic that Jesus so strongly condemned. They have no faith in God’s law and order, and vainly imagine that there are “remedies” and “immunizers” that will enable them to transgress the laws of life with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The medicine man who gives you a pill or a powder and tells you to eat anything you want; the chiropractor who tells you to <sup>£</sup>eat whatever you please, that “innate” (a spooky “soul” of some kind) can adapt the stomach to food quicker than any dietitian can adapt a diet to the stomach’; the Christian (?) Scientist (?) who tells yon that you can eat what you please and all you want, and that God will take care of you; these shamans are all practicing black magic and ignoring law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heap abuses upon your body until your pancreas is broken down and you have diabetes; then go to a doctor and get his magical insulin and continue the abuses. If your kidneys break down, use. slippery elm bark and go on abusing your body. Take the Calmett serum and abuse your body as much as you please; you can never have tuberculosis. Nail a horseshoe over your door and no evil spirits can enter your home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mrs. Levens says that slippery elm bark may “be relied on to offset any condition of irritation in the human body”, One does not even have to go to the disagreeable trouble of removing the cause of the irritation.

<p><span class="font6">HpHEBE is a little book in circulation called A </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Precious Metal of the Kitchen.</span><span class="font6"> On page 10 of the booklet, under the caption “Where Aluminum Does All the Cooking”, there appear the following statements: “Everybody knows the great Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago, and - the Los Angeles Biltmore, one of the finest on the Pacific Coast. These are only two of many famous hotels with all aluminum kitchens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under date of May 7, 1931, William M. Dewey, managing director of the great Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago, said: “Acknowledging your letter of May 1, we are pleased to advise that the Edgewater Beach Hotel uses no aluminum cooking utensils.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now do not allow the fact that somebody has been caught in a lie hinder you from admiring a nice piece of advertising literature: and furthermore, if you still feel that you would like to continue to plate your interior with a nice coat of aluminum, go right ahead.

<p><span class="font7">Potash vs. Common Salt </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By E. E. Buttner (South Africa')</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">NpHE article on “Common Salt”, by H. J. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A-</span><span class="font6"> North, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 306, is one of the most unfortunate that has ever appeared in our splendid magazine. First of all, the word '■'salt” (Mark 9:50 and Luke 14:34) is a misleading translation for a substance that has nothing to do with common table salt. In fact, the evangelists refer to an extremely uncommon salt which is better rendered ’mineral salts’. That the substance contains very little common salt is shown by Luke 14:35, which shows it must have been a potash salt, if anything; for common salt is poisonous to vegetation, except in minute quantities, but potash deposits make splendid fertilizers, and are also used by primitive peoples much as wc use common salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely Mr. North has .read that the Dead Sea is rich in potash salts, so much so that a huge company is planning to exploit it for potash production, for fertilizers, etc. That potash is more important than common salt is proven by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nature herself; for all natural food, the sole diet of the entire animal kingdom, including primitive man, throughout the ages, contains large quantities of potash but only small amounts of common salt. Surely the Creator made no mistake when He provided the animal kingdom with food. Wheat contains ten times as much potash as common salt; and mother's milk five times as much. Surely this proves how nature rigidly keeps out the salt from the milk of the modern salt-poisoned mother. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So little common salt does natural food contain that civilized people habitually add it artificially, as if the Creator forgot all about it. Potatoes, spinach and fruits frequently contain ten times as much potash as salt, while beans contain seventy times as much, and some nuts thirty times as much. So much for the much despised potassium. Table salt is only a product of civilization; it was not in man’s food originally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A N AERIAL survey of the Yangtse valley in China, a survey in which, by the way, Colonel Lindbergh and his wife have most faithfully and gallantly participated, shows 3,600 square miles under water. In this vast area only the walled cities in the vicinity of the Grand Canal have escaped disaster. The flooded area comprises one of the most fertile alluvial plains in the world. In this plain there is not even a hillock, and it is considered certain that at least 250,000 have been drowned, and perhaps many more. As a result of the floods and other untoward conditions it is estimated that in China there are now 200,000,000 unemployed. In vast areas of the country no crops can be gathered this year, and it is doubtful whether any can be sown next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVATI GOD created all things. His power is unlimited. Therefore He is called the Almighty God. He gave life to innumerable intelligent creatures as well as to unintelligent creations. He also made countless inanimate creations. He has hidden in the earth, sky and air myriads of laws, forces, powers and elements, upon which His intelligent creatures can feast their minds and delight their hearts as they meditate on the power, wisdom and love of their great Creator and come to comprehend the beauty, the grandeur, the variety, the harmony and the immensity of God’s universe and His creations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has also provided an eternity, during which His wondering creatures can exercise their intelligence, in the study, meditation, use and enjoyment of His blessings. During this same eternity His intelligent creatures will show forth their gratitude and appreciation to Almighty God for all His gifts, and honor and extol His name and virtues above that of all creatures in heaven or in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In James 1:17 we read: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.” This being true, it is eminently proper that Jehovah should be recognized as the Giver of these gifts: and the credit, praise and thanksgiving therefor should be given to Him, and not to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Few people recognize the power of Jehovah, because they do not properly consider His handiwork. In Psalm 19:1 we read: “The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament shew’eth his handywmrk.” Again, we read, in Romans 1:20, that “his invisible things, even his eternal power and deity, since the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived by the things which are made”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaejlott) </span><span class="font6">While it is true that the power, wisdom and love of the Creator can be seen in His handiwork, in earth and sea and sky, yet one must go to the Bible to get a proper appreciation of the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book of nature contains a revelation of God, but the revelation found in His Word is far grander and more convincing. Very few have the time or inclination to study the book of nature; and far fewer take the time to study the Bible. The result is that God and His attributes are not appreciated among the children of men, except by the very few who carefully and prayerfully study both books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The principal reason why the power of God is not properly recognized and appreciated is the fact that when men discover one of God’s laws, principles or forces, they immediately credit the discoverer with being the author of the same, and entirely overlook the fact that God is the author. For instance: The wonderful power of electricity was created by Jehovah God, many thousands of years ago. Just a few short years ago some man stumbled upon this hidden power, through no wisdom of his own. The discovery was purely an accident. Investigating the new-found force or power men have put it to a practical use, the very use for which God designed it, namely, the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, instead of giving Jehovah God credit fox* this wonderful power, men gave the honor and appreciation to the one who accidentally discovered it. In doing this they robbed God of the glory that is due unto His name. With cool audacity and impudent presumption </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">men</span><span class="font6"> took the honor to themselves, patented and copyrighted </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font6"> inventions, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font6"> ideas, and secured the enactment of special laws giving them grants and charters, so that they could proceed to charge the people exorbitant prices for that which God created as a blessing for all the people, and became rich by stealing that which God gave as a free gift to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of books have been circulated extolling the virtues and proclaiming the benefactions of these so-called great men, who have oppressed their fellow<sup>7</sup> men by charging them the highest possible price for God’s free gifts to men. Thus God has not been credited with being the Giver of every good and perfect gift. His name has been pushed into the background, while men have been lauded, praised and extolled as great who have never been entitled to such praise and laudation. Millions of men and women have been led to render to fallen and fallible men the worship and praise which properly has belonged to Jehovah God. Speaking of this very thing, the apostle says: “Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature fthe created thing] more than the Creator.”—Rom. 1: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In God’s sight there are no great men. Even the best specimens of the race are selfish, cruel, fallen and sinful. Even Jesus, the perfect and sinless One, said: “Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.” (Matt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">19:17) If the holy, harmless and undefiled Jesus refused to claim that He was good, surely men should manifest greater humility, and should refuse to let other men call them good. All the credit for the blessings which people possess belongs to God; all the glory belongs to Him, and our gratitude and appreciation should be expressed to Him and not to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s power is manifested in the creation of billions of planets; the creation of the sun to give its light by day, and of the moon and stars for light by night, for the blessing of mankind; in the creation of the earth, with its marvelous variety of life, and especially of man, fearfully and wonderfully made, in the image of his Creator; in the variety of law’s ■which control all these creations; the order, symmetry, harmony, color and beauty of it all. The apostle says that The invisible things of God, even his eternal power and deity are clearly seen’ as we meditate upon these visible creations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming to the Bible, His power is manifested, when lie set before the first man and woman the privilege of life on condition of .obedience, and death if they should disobey. They disobeying the divine law, God’s power was manifested in enforcing the death penalty against the two. For six thousand years God has continuously enforced His judgment. Death has claimed and is claiming every member of the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God, during the past six thousand years, has repeatedly declared that lie purposes to deliver the race from the curse of sin and death, and that He has the power so to do. Through His Son Jesus He sent to the earth a message that He had the power, and would exercise that power at the proper time, to resurrect all the billions of the dead, both the good and the evil. (John 5: 28, 29) In the garden of Eden, in pronouncing the condemnation against the serpent, who represented the Devil, God said there would eventually come a “seed of the woman” who would “bruise” the head of the serpent. In plain language this was a promise that Satan would be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul tells us that the “seed of the woman” is Christ and His church. (Rom. 16: 20) Paul also tolls us that God purposes to destroy the Devil. (Heb. 2:14) We are also told that those who wilfully sin after having come to a knowledge of the truth will die the second death. (Heb. 10: 26-29; Rev. 20:14, .15) Jehovah God has repeatedly declared that it is His purpose to fill the earth with a happy race of human creatures, and to write His law upon their hearts, and that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess to the honor and praise of His name. Not only* has He purposed all this, but He has sworn that He will accomplish Ills purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Isaiah 45: 22, 23 we read: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.” Again, in Isaiah 46:9-11 we read: “I am Goel, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. ... I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” Thus Jehovah God declares His purpose, and indicates that He has the power to carry out that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the past six thousand years Satan has denied that God possesses such power. When God told Adam and Eve that they would surely die if they ate the forbidden fruit, Satan denied that God could take their life, by saying, ‘God doth know that ye will not surely die, but ye shall become like gods, knowing good and evil.’ (Gen. 3:1-5) Satan has succeeded in getting the whole world to believe that people do not die, and thus he denies the power of God, claiming that God cannot enforce the death penalty, and that therefore He cannot resurrect the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan has made people believe that there is no personal Devil, and that therefore God cannot kill the Devil. He has made people believe that God will torment people everlastingly for disobedience, thus denying that God is love and that He will punish with second death those whp wilfully disobey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But. what an exhibition of divine power it will be, when God binds the Devil for a thousand years so that he will deceive the nations no more till the thousand years are ended! (Rev. 20:1-3) What an exhibition of power will be manifested, when God brings forth from the tomb all that are in the graves, both good and evil! (John 5:28,29) Another exhibition of power will be given when, at the end of the thousand years, Satan will be loosed, for a little season, and then 'destroyed by being east into the “lake of fire”. (Rev. 20:10; Heb. 2:14) God wills that during this thousand years all the living and dead shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim. 2:3,4; Heb. 10:26) These final exhibitions of power will convince the most skeptical that. Jehovah God is the only true God, and that all praise, honor and worship belong to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No human creature is worthy of fear, reverence or worship. To thus serve and laud mankind is robbery of God. For six thousand years men have set forth their own schemes for blessing the race. They have tried many different forms of government, and over five hundred different kinds of religion, and have made every kind of law, all of which they claimed were wise and should be obeyed because they would be a blessing to the people. How foolish have been man’s governments, religions and laws! How manifestly these have failed to bless the race! How puny, silly and inane have been man’s efforts to show forth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his power, wisdom and justice!</span><span class="font6"> No wonder the apostle said that “the foolishness of God is wiser than men”.—1 Cor. 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men’s claim to power and wisdom is but a species of insanity, due to too high an opinion of themselves. In the near future God will end all the boastful schemes of men by destroying in the battle of Armageddon the man-made governments, man-made religions of earth and all man-made laws, and establishing one righteous government, with just and righteous laws, under which men will worship God in spirit and in truth and without the handicap of having to choose from several hundred different kinds of religion. Thus God’s name will be vindicated, His power and love manifested, and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory.—Ps. 72.: 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ijhe Paramount Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s name is the most vital issue before all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few have settled the question by taking an unequivocal stand on the side of Jehovah. Such now give all honor and glory to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All who will ever enjoy life everlasting must do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who have trusted in Jehovah and His provision for salvation through the blood of His beloved Son ; who have devoted their lives exclusively to Him, and who have overcome the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">world, rejoice and say: “Our soul is escaped . as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the ,<sub>= </sub>snare is broken, and wm are escaped. Our help . is in the name of Jehovah, wdro made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 124:7,8) Appreciating the- -precious privilege of knowing His name, they say: “Thy name, 0 Jehovah, endureth for over: and thy memorial, 0 Jehovah, throughout all...............</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">generations.”-—Ps. 135:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah gives a name to a creature, -that name is significant. With stronger reason- ........</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ing, when Jehovah reveals himself by a name, ’ that name is of the greatest importance to His creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By His name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font6"> He reveals himself as the Creator of heaven and earth and of all things that are good, and the Giver of life to ail that .......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He reveals himself by the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, </span><span class="font6">which means His purposes concerning His creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He reveals himself by the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font6"> which means that His power is unlimited and that none can stand against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He reveals himself by the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah of hosts,</span><span class="font6"> which means the Almighty God of war that destroys those that persist in wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He reveals Himself by the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Most High, </span><span class="font6">which means that He is above and over all, is moved always by love, and rules the universe in justice and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus came to earth, Jehovah revealed himself as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">heavenly Father</span><span class="font6"> of the new crea-. _ tion, meaning that He is the source of life to all who live for ever in the heavenly realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Understanding these truths, man begins to appreciate the force of the words of Jesus, who said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to His Word, Jehovah, in. .His due time, will fully demonstrate to all intelligent creation His own supremacy in power, His exact justice, His perfect wisdom, and His complete unselfishness. He will thereby open the, way, to all who love Him and who maintain their integrity, for a full opportunity for faith and confidence in Him and for gaining and receiving the blessings of life everlasting. His word and His name are the great questions involved. The vindication thereof is the paramount reason for the permission of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the very beginning of man’s existence</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">upon earth, something over sixty centuries ago, the name of Jehovah has been reproached by • Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In derision and mockery Satan caused the people to call themselves by the name of Jehovah, as we read in Genesis 4:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">'</span><span class="font6"> Satan moved men to build cities and empires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He caused the organization by men of the empires of Babylon, Egypt, Assyria, and all <sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other world powers. He saturated these or</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ganizations, each in its turn, with his Devil re-iigion. He has used them, and particularly the false religious element, to bring reproach upon the name of Jehovah, the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; Today every organized religion under the sun __ either openly or covertly reproaches the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, - The holy prophet wrote: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” (Ps. 33:12) But where is there a nation on earth today whose ~~ God is Jehovah and which nation and people are devoted wholly to God and to the honor of ...... His name ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ansiver must bo that there is not one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eeligion and politics and commerce of the world are now united to rule in every nation of earth. They have Satan for their god, even .........though outwardly calling themselves by the _ name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">........ In times past God has magnified His word GE above His name. Now the time has come for Him to exalt His name as well as His word. Both His name and liis word are now exalted <sub>:</sub> . in Zion, which is His own organization. Upon “...... earth there is now a remnant of those whom the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lord God has called, and to such He has committed His word and the honor of bearing testimony among the people concerning His name. These God has taken out and separated from among men as “a people for his name&quot;’. They are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.......... To such Jehovah says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.............shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heav-• - ens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and T..... say un to Zion, Thou art my people.”—Isa. 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time is at hand when the great issue, Who is the Almighty One? must be for ever settled. Jehovah has allowed the wicked one to : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry on his wicked work throughout all the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At given times, and for the benefit of those wno love Him, God has brought His own name prominently to the fore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today men who claim to be Christians and teachers of the Christian religion deny the Word of God concerning His creation of man, the disobedience and fall of man, and the provision for redemption through the blood of Christ; and in doing so they cast reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. They teach doctrines that dishonor His name, and openly declare their allegiance to Satan’s organization. Their course of action is a mockery and a reproach to the Lord..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“'As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith,” because Satan is their god. Jehovah says concerning them: “But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be made manifest to all.” (2 Tim. 3: 8, 9) There is a limit to the practice of evil, and that limit has been reached by Satan and his agencies. The issue of the almighty Name is now to be settled for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who, then, is the Almighty God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah says: “I am Jehovah; that is my name; and my glory? will I not give to another.” (Isa. 42:8) Jehovah will now make known to the blinded people His supreme power, His wisdom, justice, and love. He causes all the people and nations to be gathered together, and demands that the Devil’s witnesses speak and justify their, course of action or else acknowledge the truth that Jehovah is the only true God. Then addressing His faithful remnant He says: “Ye are my witnesses, . . . that I am God; . . . before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.”—Isa. 43: 8-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This great issue will now be settled finally, and Jehovah declares that He will settle it by destroying Satan and his evil organization. Before that great war of destruction, He causes His faithful witnesses to serve notice upon the nations and peoples of earth concerning His purpose to end the practice of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah assembles the nations of earth for decision. (Joel 3:14) The nations are now assembled. He pronounces upon them His judgment, and then pours upon them His righteous indignation and destroys Satan and his organization.—Zeph. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead of having destroyed Satan at the very beginning, God has allowed him to pursue his course of wickedness and do everything within his power to oppose God. In the meantime God has kept His Word and His name before those who have sincerely desired to know and to do righteousness, and such He has preserved from the assaults of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Satan will have done all that he can possibly do to dispute the supremacy, the povz-er, the wisdom and justice, and the love of Jehovah God, then Jehovah, in the great war, will stop Satan’s operations of evil in the earth. Jehovah thereby proves himself to be supreme in power, the Almighty Eternal God, the Most High, besides whom there is no other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By so doing, Jehovah will stop for ever the mouths of all creatures from saying that there is another like unto Jehovah God. This is the most effective way to teach all creation that there is but one Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah will remove the blindness of the people, that they may know Him and that they may know that there is no way of obtaining everlasting life besides the way which Jehovah God has prepared, and that that way is through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ His beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By this course of action Jehovah will open the way for full faith and confidence in Him, that all creation may come to know that He is the Almighty God, that He is perfect in wisdom, that He is just and has made provision for the justification of men, and that He is love because He is the perfect expression of unselfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All creation will then come to know that Satan is the enemy of God and of every creature that wants to do right, and that Satan is the one who has been and is responsible for all the evil and wickedness practiced in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Satan the Lord God long ago caused His prophet to write: “Thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">not the house of his prisoners? All the kings of -the nations, even all.of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pit; as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> carcase trodden under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou ” hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people ; .........</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the seed of evildoers shall never be renowmed.” &quot;&nbsp;—Isa. 14:15-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee; thou shalt be a &quot;&quot;&nbsp;terror, and never shalt thou he any more.”— Ezek. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was Satan who caused Israel to prove uh-.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">faithful to God. It was the same wicked rebel that is responsible for the evil among all the nations and peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the name of Jehovah that the faithful remnant of the followers of Christ now on earth exalt and praise. (Isa. 12:4-6) It will be the . name of Jehovah, the Almighty God, that the peoples of all the earth will honor forever when they know<sup>7</sup> Him and learn of His love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s prophet foretold the song of praise tliat will flow from the lips of the people to the glory of His name w’hen they are settled in peace in His kingdom: “Make a joyful noise unto God, - J all ye lands; sing forth the honor of his name; make his praise glorious. Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. AU the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.”—Ps. 66:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let those wdio love Jehovah God now join in telling others about Him and His wondrous works. “0 give thanks unto Jehovah; proclaim </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> name; make known </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> deeds among the people. Sing unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him,</span><span class="font6"> sing psalms unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him:</span><span class="font6"> talk ye of all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> wondrous wmrks. Glory ye in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font6">holy name: let the hmrt of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.”—Ps, 105:1-3.</span></p>

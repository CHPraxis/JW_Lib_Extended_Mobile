<p><span class="font10">Denmark, &quot;The Land of the Sea”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font6">EN</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">MAR</span><span class="font6">K is a good deal like Florida, only it is right side up, while Florida is upside down: that is to say, while one is at one end of the Gulf Stream and one at the other, one projects north from the mainland of Europe into the North and Baltic Seas, which it separates, while the other projects south from the mainland of America and separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Atlantic. It is only a little way from the tip of Florida to Cuba at the south, and it is only a little way from the tip of Denmark to Norway or Sweden at the north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The highest elevation in Denmark is 550 feet, and the highest elevation in Florida is 325 feet. Both states have enormous coast lines. Both have hundreds of islands nearby, and both have hundreds of square miles of bogs or swamps. Florida is mostly sand and rock, and Denmark is the same. One is a winter paradise; the other a summer paradise. One is in the latitude of Mexico; the other, in the latitude of Labrador. One is far-famed for its fruits and vegetables; the other, for its bacon and butter. The area of Denmark is 17,144 square miles; that of Florida, 58,666 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Neither Denmark nor Florida has any coal, and Florida would not need it even if it had it. However, the climate of Denmark is not extremely cold: the Gulf Stream keeps it fairly comfortable even in winter. The mean temperature of the year is 47 degrees. Both have navigable inland waters of considerable extent, and these waters are well stocked with fish. In both cases the adjacent islands lie to the east of the main peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only a start has been made in the development of Florida; but Denmark is one of the most fully developed parts of the globe, being the world’s leading exponent of intensified farming. The coast on the north and west is an almost uninhabitable land of drifting sands. In places, huge dykes have been erected, as in Holland, to keep out the ravages, of the sea. Large areas of the drifting sands have been reclaimed in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besides the peninsula, Jutland, and the large islands which lie to the east, Fyen, Sjaelland and Laaland, Denmark possesses the Faroe islands, in the north Atlantic, and Greenland, in the Arctic. Iceland is united with Denmark through the sovereign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Some Historical Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The early history of Denmark reads like a leaf taken from the current archives of Chicago. To those who like to read about murders we suggest a reading of the sagas. It was from Denmark’s shores that the Angles and Saxons sailed in the fifth century to the conquest of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Scandinavia, that is, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, was at one time all one country, but it does not suit the Nordic races to be or remain subjugated, pacified and united. Theirs is the genius of conquest and division, separation, individuality. The Northmen are more willing to boss somebody else than they are to be bossed, even by one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the eleventh century Denmark included England within its domain, but a natural ineptitude for submission to foreign government led to the breaking up of the one large realm of the north into its present divisions. Originally all of one race, they now manifest the strong differences of temperament and individuality which mark them wherever they go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is only about a quarter of a century since Norway broke away from Sweden, with no particular reason for so doing except that they wanted to govern themselves. Within recent months the Faroe islands and Iceland have threatened to break away from Denmark, for</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">no reason except that they do not appreciate being ruled from a distance. Passports among Scandinavian countries were abolished in 1929,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">King Christian X will be sixty-one years of age on the 25th of this coming September. The tallest of European kings, he is devoted to hunting, yachting, skating and other sports, and is </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font6">mensely popular. He has the good sense to be informal on all occasions, formal or informal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Folkething (House of Representatives) has 149 members; the Landsthing (Senate) 76 members. There are 22 amters (counties), each with an amtmand (governor). All may vote, male or female, who have a fixed place of abode and are not in receipt of poor relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Seekers of Social Reform</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the middle of the last century, when legislation was passed which encouraged the breaking up of the large estates of the nobility, Denmark has been making unexampled progress in social reforms of all kinds and has her aim set for disarmament, the almost complete abolishment of the army and navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the present time the Danish army is a national militia, commencing at the age of 20 and lasting for sixteen years. Even the clergy have to serve. That is a good thing. They have always been in favor of war. If Denmark is ever foolish enough to get into one, the clergy should be favored with positions as privates and put in the front line trenches, with the politicians and financiers as their comrades in arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The government hopes to use the money it will save on its military budget to finance its social welfare legislation. Now, isn’t that good common sense ? A small force of civilian patrols will preserve order, which many people in Denmark and elsewhere believe is the best guaranty of peace. The smaller the force of soldiery, the greater the security of the country. The electorate has unequivocally accepted the disarmament protect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Old age pensions are granted to any person over 65 fulfilling certain conditions, and must be sufficient for maintenance and medical attendance. This takes care of 100,000 persons a year. It is generally admitted that in no other country in the world are the poor so secure against ill-treatment or neglect as in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of the poor relief is entirely in the hands of trained officials. The system is a preventive one; it aims to again make self-supporting those who are already paupers, and if they refuse the chance offered, and have no wish to be made self-supporting, they are made sorry by punitive measures. It is claimed for the system that it provides even-handed justice, as far as that is possible under present imperfect conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nursing mothers must be supported by the state for about two months, in cases of necessity. Many of the large factories have rooms in which babies can be brought to be nursed by working mothers. Contemplated moves of social reform are establishment of national labor exchanges, national insurance, unemployment insurance and accident insurance, for everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Education for Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Danish education lias for its aim the cultivation in the young man or woman of a sense of responsibility. Elementary education is compulsory between the ages of seven and fourteen, and most of the elementary schools are free. Illiteracy is not more than one-tenth of one percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Folks” high schools are privately owned and operated, but are supported by the state. The government sees to it that the finances of the schools, which are Lutheran, are maintained, and grants the necessary subsidies and scholarships. It is everywhere admitted that the rural high schools have lifted Denmark from serfdom to the highest rank of any agricultural country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a typical country high school the men have a term of five months during midwinter, when little can be done on the farms, and the girls have a three months’ term in the summer. The school may be simply a fine old house, set back from the road in a grove of trees. It is the personality of the teachers that really makes the schools what they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an International College, on a farm of 500 acres, an hour or so a day is given to literary and scientific studies, but most of the time is spent in learning and earning bv actual work in field and orchard and vegetable garden, in dairy and smokehouse, at the carpenter’s bench, and in the brick and tile kilns and potteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A high sense of honor is sought. Two students who entered into contracts to assist certain coaches by defaming other coaches were perpetually excluded from the University of Copenhagen, which prevents their ever taking up</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">law or any other profession in Denmark requiring a university degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Denmark (population 3,440,000) has 860 public libraries, 450 booksellers, and two years ago had 230,000 radio receiving sets in operation. There are five broadcasting stations, all government-owned, and supported by proceeds from license fees. Over here we laugh at an arrangement which puts it up to a few state officials to decide what the people may or may not have over the radio, but in Denmark that is what they like and what they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The country so appreciates her poets that she places them on the civil list and pays them a regular salary. Well, anybody who can write a poem in such a language as Dano-Norwegian, and get any two lines to come out with the same number of feet and approximately the same terminal syllables, ought certainly to be given a pension for his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Intelligent, Efficient Cooperation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Danish workingman becomes the owner of his own flat (if he lives in a city) by paying rent for twenty-five to thirty years, with an additional annual payment of $15.00. The rents lie pays are less than equally good accommodations would cost anywhere else. This is what educated, intelligent cooperation does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are various societies. In one, each member contributes 50c a month for a period of ten years, after which he may withdraw his money, with the accumulated interest at 4| percent, or let it remain and be entitled to continuous participation in annual dividends and in the drawing of lots for houses, to be paid for as above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One association has built 4,000 flats. It does not allow its members to sell its shares, thus keeping down speculation. Loans or deposits are returned in full if a member resigns from the society or moves. The society reserves to itself the increment of the property should a member resign, and this makes for stability of the association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danes have shown a genius for cooperation in their agricultural work. They have 1,500 cooperative dairies. Every farmer is within a mile of one. He gets his machinery, cattle foods and supplies from cooperatives. In a few years he easily switched from grain production to dairying, bacon and poultry, and built up consumer cooperatives as well as producer cooperatives, thus getting all the profits out of his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Over 90 percent of the dairy farms of the country are cooperative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The member of a cooperative dairy delivers his milk to the dairy, where it is skimmed and the cream is converted into butter and cheese. The farmer is paid for his milk in proportion to its amount and also its butter content. He receives back the skimmed milk, for which he pays, as it is excellent food for live stock. In the general meeting, each shareholder has one vote, regardless of the milk he has contributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Danish industrial workers have insurance benefits of all kinds, against illness, accident, unemployment, old age, and widowhood. Affiliated with the trade unions are clubs which care for him when he is ill. Hospital service and medical attendance are free to stricken members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Most Hospitable People</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danish people have the reputation of being the most hospitable people in the world. They have regular and well-formed features, fair hair, blue eyes, with muscular frames. They are kind-hearted, honest and simple-minded, and noted for being bold and hardy seamen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Permanent Court of Arbitration interprets agreements and legal points as between employers, employees and others. There is no appeal from its findings, which are final. The Public Mediation Institution anticipates industrial troubles, and, when stoppage of work impends, takes steps to intervene and if possible prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danish people are human. They made millions on millions during the World War, and then, like everybody else, lost it all in speculation. When deflation came the largest bank in the country lost thirty million pounds, and the government saddled the loss on the taxpayers, pleading that there was no other way to save the economic life of the nation. Taxes are twice what they were pre-war, with wages twice as much and goods twice as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wild life abounds, without danger of extinction. Persons under eighteen may not carry guns. The use of spring traps is prohibited except by permit, and when this is given traps must be visited three times a day. There are laws to protect animals in circuses, menageries and zoological gardens, making the Danish laws for the protection of animals more progressive, humane and economic than those of any other state.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>QOLDEN AGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pigs in Paradise &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pigs are in paradise in Denmark, and in hades in England. That is to say, Denmark is the nrize country for pig raising, and England is the prize country for consuming ham and bacon. In the persnickety English market Danish hams and bacon command the highest prices, and the market for them is so steady and certain that out of a total of 256,257 tons of these delec-tables exported from Denmark in 1927 no less than 252,896 tons mere dispatched to Great Britain, and that despite the fact that another great industrial country, Germany, joins Denmark by land, while Britain and Denmark are separated by the North Sea,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fifty years ago Denmark knew little or nothing about raising and marketing pigs, but the crossing of imported large white pigs with the native breed has given a stock of high fertility with good bacon quality and has resulted in the high type of pigs now found all over the country, 5,000,000 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite its rocky, sterile soil, the average yield of milk per cow in Denmark is nearly twice that of the average American cow. In America, when the cows are turned out to pasture, they wander far and wide over the landscape; but in Denmark bossy is tied to a rope and the rope is tied to a stake, and the stake is not moved until bossy has trimmed the circle around that stake as though a lawn mower had run over it. The result is that all the pasture lands are cropped and all kept fertile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Danish farmers export 112,000 tons of butter a year; and that is a great amount of butter to be exported from so small a country. They eat margarine themselves, preferring to turn their butter into cash rather than to tickle their own palates. Denmark possesses a larger proportion of dairy cattle to population than any other country. There is a dairy cow to every inhabitant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Other Agricultural Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cutting up of the estates of the nobility and the distribution of these (by sale and purchase) has been the making of Denmark. From 1835, when the new policy went into effect, to 1904 the number of farm holders increased from 157,321 to 289,130. This good work still goes on, and in the last twenty-five years there has been a steady increase of about 1,000 farms a year. All but four percent of the total number of farms in Denmark' are owned by the farmers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Denmark must still believe in horses, as there w’ere 518,000 of them in the census of 1928, but it probably vron’t be long until most of these will find their way to the distributers of dried beef and toxin-antitoxin. Large flocks of sheep are kept, but rather for the flesh than for the wool, which is coarse and short. Wild fowl, including the famous eider duck, are plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In February, 1917, Denmark’s supply of grains, oil-eakes, fodder and fertilizer, upon which she depended for the upkeep of her live stock and soil, was suddenly cut off by Germany’s submarine campaign. Beets, carrots and other vegetable roots were immediately raised to take the place of the foregoing, as far as that was possible. The job was completed by killing off and marketing. the least efficient animals, so that the available food could be given to the preservation of the better stock. It was a knotty problem to solve, but it was solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the farmers have risen from serfdom to independence they have gradually become more conservative and less friendly to the measures of social reform adopted and projected. In a recent clash between farmers and farm workers, the labor unions of the cities threw their weight on the side of the farm workers. More than a third of the working population derive their livelihood from agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The success of the Danish farmers is so pronounced, and their fame so widespread, that the French government is negotiating for a settlement of Danes in France, to assist French farmers to better methods of agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danish government finances Danish agricultural exports. The state guarantees for a period of two years up to 85 percent of the exporter’s draft and collects payment of a certain premium into a fund to cover possible losses. The stade’s export credit fund is $12,000,000. The plan gives special consideration to the exploitation of new markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danish farmer buys and sells everything through his own cooperative organizations. He carries his own risks, takes his losses in bad years and his profits in good ones, and sticks to the organization through thick amd thin. He does not allow a bunch of financial wolves to pick his bones of all the profits, as is commonly done in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Other Industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besides its principal business, which is the production and distribution of food, Denmark has important shipbuilding, foundry, Diesel engine, flour, textile, shoe, cement, pottery, furniture, musical instrument, machinery, automobile, vegetable and animal oil and margarine industries. It is the home of the Diesel motor ship. It is calculated that 31 percent of the population are dependent for support upon these various lines of activity. There are important fisheries. A few of the manufacturing establishments of Denmark belong to the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 3,148 miles of railroad, half of which is state owned, and all of it profitable. On account of the size and importance of the islands to the east, a continuous journey through Denmark is a succession of trips by rail and sea. Thus, a traveler from Britain lands at Esbjerg and wishes to go to Copenhagen. He rides 50 miles by rail across the peninsula of Jutland to Fredericia, There he takes a short ferry ride to Middelfart, on the island of Fyen, where another fifty-mile trip by rail takes him to Nyborg. Here he has a long ferry trip to Korsor on the island of Sjaelland. Another ride of 100 miles by rail brings him to his destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, should he wish to go to some point on the island of Laaland he would have still another hundred miles by rail to Vordingborg, and another short ferry trip and another railroad ride before he could get to where he wanted to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Esbjerg, just mentioned, is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> city of 25,000 inhabitants located on the sand dunes, and built where it is because Denmark was determined to have a port at that point on the western shore of the barrens of the Jutland peninsula, from which it could ship its products to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Odense, on the island of Fyen, is a seaport city of 70,000 inhabitants. It was once the capital. The ports of Aarhus and Aalborg are on the eastern shores of the Jutland peninsula. Copenhagen, population 731,496, is the principal city, the capital, the most important port, and the ‘Constantinople of the North’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Copenhagen, Key to the Baltic</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Copenhagen was founded in 1167 to protect the land from the pirates then infesting the Baltic waters. It is situated on the shore of a sound twelve miles broad, and has a fine, large harbor. A great free port, free from customs dues, was constructed in 1890-94 to the north of the harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The land area of the free port is now 128 acres, the water 83 acres, and the length of the piers three miles. It has covered floor areas of 40 acres, and, with electric and steam cranes and pneumatic and other grain elevators, and other mechanical equipment, is admirably fitted for the loading, unloading, transshipment and storage of cargoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is need for a free port just about where Copenhagen is located. The Baltic is often frozen. Copenhagen is ice free. The Baltic is full of shallows. Copenhagen can take the big vessels, and is planning to be able to take still bigger ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Large steamers bound for the Baltic find it unprofitable to go from one port to another. They prefer to come to Copenhagen and unload all at once and reload all at once, and let the smaller steamers, suited to the Baltic, have the short hauls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The distance from New York to Copenhagen is 23 nautical miles less than the distance from New York to Hamburg, and the distance from Copenhagen to eastern Baltic ports is 200 miles less than from Hamburg, so the city has many natural advantages. Last year 5,624,000 tons were loaded in and out of Copenhagen. In its merchant fleet Denmark has 496 steamers, 147 motor vessels, and 62 sailing ships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nowhere can one find happier, healthier children than in Denmark. Each summer all the school children of Copenhagen are taken to the country for a six 'weeks’ vacation. They are carried free on the railroads and boarded free by the farmers and fishermen where they lodge. Free holiday camps are provided by the government for those that cannot be accommodated by the country home owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nowhere else can one find fruits, flowers and gardens in such profusion as in Denmark. Nowhere else can one find crowds with equal levity unaccompanied by such freedom from rowdyism. Good food is plentiful and cheap. There are bicycles by the thousands. Denmark is a good place to live and a good place to visit. The Danes have reason to be proud of their country.</span></p>

I have shot him with both rifle and motionpicture camera, and it has been my observation that his mad charges are simply attempts to get away from the man taint. He can see only a few feet, and charges blindly. Anything that gets in his way is out of luck, but I am firmly convinced that he is retreating rather than attacking.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The British have paid in dollars more than one-third of what they originally borrowed, and now they owe in real debt, measured in commodity values, more than twice as much as they did at the end of 1919, just after they had received the last advances from our treasury. As commodity prices decline all debts become harder to pay. The dollars owed are equivalent to increasing amounts of goods. They represent greater totals of human effort, and more tons and bushels of valuable merchandise. That is what has happened to the British debt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">TN THE New Yorker, one of Manhattan’s newest skyscrapers, a single man presses levers which drop down coal from the chutes in which it is stored. Other levers run it through pulverizing machinery, weigh it, and blow it into the furnaces, where it is consumed. Still others blow the ashes seventy feet to the trucks at the street levels. The coal is neither seen nor touched by anybody from the time, it is dropped in the chutes until it comes out as ashes. Does anybody now claim that labor-saving machinery does not save labor? And who are to feed the laborers that are thus displaced? The answer is. that, in the end, they must be fed by the owners of the machinery; for it is certain that they will be fed, and there is no other way to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A. (1) Trade rivalry between Great Britain and Germany and the scramble for territory especially in Africa. (2) The conflict between Russia and Germany for the domination of the Balkan Peninsula. (3) The old inherited animosities between France and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. What was the immediate cause of the outbreak of hostilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. The murder of the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary, in Bosnia, by members of a PanSlavic organization working hand in hand with the Serbian government for the annexation of Bosnia to Serbia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. What were the official reasons for the entry of the United States into the World AVar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. (1) Resumption of submarine warfare by Germany (after the failure of Great Britain to agree to its discontinuance at the request of Germany, with the United States acting as intermediary). (2) Interference with neutral trade. (3) Economic ties with the allies. (4) “To make the World safe for Democracy.” (5) “To end war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. What were the contributing factors ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. (1) The sinking of the Lusitania, a British ship, carrying munitions of war, with the loss of 114 Americans (on board in spite of warning by Germany). (2) Allied propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Was Germany the “sole aggressor” in the World War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. The opinion of the “sole guilt” of Germany is no longer held by educated persons who have studied the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Was Germany the only prepared nation in Europe in 1914; and did preparedness prevent?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Q. Did Great Britain enter the war to defend Belgium?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Great Britain has officially denied the “protection of Belgium” myth, and acknowledged that the struggle between rival imperialisms was the real reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Would Great Britain have invaded Belgium in case of military necessity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Yes! As early as 1911 Great Britain and France had perfected a plan for “marching through” Belgium in the event of a war with Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Has any nation ever observed the established “rules” in war time?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Bible Students Radio Echo” (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font6">OES it follow that because one knows much truth he is therefore an acceptable servant of God? Certainly not. There are hosts of spirit creatures who possess far more mere knowledge of the truth than is possessed by many of us poor humans, but instead of being acceptable servants of God they are his enemies and are so accounted by him. The existence and the activities of these unseen opposers is well known to every student of the Scriptures, and particularly to such of these as are in the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Does it follow that those who were once used by the Lord in doing His work will continue to be used by Him provided they retain the full possession of their faculties and have the purpose to utilize these in the way they think best to accomplish God’s will? The answer is, Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has His ways of doing things, and the Scriptures plainly show that it is His purpose that His work shall be done in His way, and that He may use a person for a time and then, because of some deflection, He may cease to use him even though he has the same ability as before, the same desire to be used, and even though he has a determination to serve, regardless of whether his services are desired or not. Let us see the truth of this. We choose a number of illustrations that should appeal at once to every true servant of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a time when Esau apparently had his birthright. That is to say, there was a time when he appeared to be in line for the blessings promised to Abraham, one of which blessings was that the Messiah should come through his Line; but Esau did not have a proper regard for the divine blessing, and because he was willing to exchange this intangible and invisible thing for a mess of pottage, he was accounted unworthy to be the progenitor of the One upon whom the salvation of the world depends and “ye know' how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears”.—Heb. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Sin of Nadab and Abihu</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is the case of Nadab and Abihu. Among the 600,000 men who came out of Egypt with Moses, these two sons of Aaron had been greatly honored. They did not, of course, fully understand the importance of their work, but the privilege of assisting in the tabernacle services seems to have been limited largely or altogether to Aaron and his four sons. Nadab and Abihu, before being appointed to the priesthood, had the signal honor of being appointed by name by Jehovah God to accompany Aaron and the seventy elders of Israel when they ascended into the mount of God to receive instructions respecting the tabernacle which was thereafter to be a meeting place between Jehovah and Israel. (Ex. 24:1, 9) Perhaps because they had been designated by name by Jehovah God they 'were guilty of presumption in undertaking to do His work in some other than His way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At any rate, we have the record that they both put fire in their censers “and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them; and they died before the Lord”. (Lev. 10:1, 2) What are we to understand from this? We must certainly see that it teaches that even though one has been greatly honored by the Lord in connection with the things of the Kingdom, he is not to assume that it is because of any respect that God has for his person, because no such respect exists. He must ever walk carefully before the Lord, fearing to take things in his own hands, lest he and his works be suddenly and completely destroyed, and that without remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Krom the fact that immediately after the destruction of Nadab and Abihu a command was given to Aaron not to drink wine or strong drink when entering the tabernacle it is inferred that both Nadab and Abihu were under the influence of liquor when they committed the sin which cost them their lives. They both died childless. Their destruction seems to represent the destruction in the second death which comes upon those who, having once been greatly honored of God and thereafter elevated to the priesthood, forget to walk humbly with their God and assume to serve Him in ways unauthorized by Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Presumption of Miriam</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is the case of Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron. Like her nephews, Nadab and Abihu, this woman was several times greatly honored by the Lord. It is supposed that it was she who watched over the ark which contained the infant Moses. (Ex. 2:4, 7) She was a prophetess of Jehovah God’s own appointment. (Mic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">6: 4) She and her companions sang triumphantly to the glory of God when the hosts of Egyptians that ere pressing on to destroy Israel were overthrown in the midst of the sea. (Ex. 15:20,21) Yet this woman, one of the most highly honored women of all time, made Moses’ marriage with the woman of his choice an occasion of murmuring against his superior position and influence. She claimed, and truly, that God had spoken by her as well as by Moses. For this insubordination to the will of God she was made a leper as white as snow, and but for the intercession of Moses would have continued in this ignoble and unhappy condition until the hand of death overtook her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Unfaithful Spies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were the cases of Shammua, Shaphat, Igai, Palti, Gaddiel, Gaddi, Ammiel, Sethur, Nahbi and Geuel. These men were designated by name to go and spy out the land of Canaan “and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land”. (Num. 13:18-20) These men were not faithful to their commission. When confronted with difficulties they lacked the faith in the Lord to go ahead and finish their task in a true and faithful manner. They died before the Lord for their unfaithfulness and for making all the congregation murmur against the Lord’s leadings. (Num. 14:36,37) After they had perished those who had been misled by their wrong course presumed to ‘carry on’ where these had left off. The account of what happened to those who were influenced by them, followed in their course, is full of portent to those who read and consider:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned. And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? but it shall not prosper. Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be with you. But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.” —Num. 14:40-45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Deflection of Korah, Dathan and Abiram</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is the case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Korah was a Levite of the family of Kohath, the same as Moses, Aaron and Miriam. He was jealous that these Levites of the same family as himself should have the offices which they held. Dathan and Abiram were of the tribe of Reuben and thought that the leadership of Israel should have gone to the tribe to which they belonged, for Reuben was Jacob’s eldest son. At length these men, who were men of influence, gathered together many against Moses and Aaron and publicly charged them with usurping a supremacy over Israel and claimed that all the congregation was holy and that anyone might officiate as priest. Moses replied that God would himself decide the matter, as it was His affair, and not the affair of Moses or Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Korah and his comrades were invited to assemble, wuth their censers, the following day before the door of the tabernacle. Now see what happened:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord. And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. And all Israel that Avere round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lest the earth swallow us up also. And. there came out a fire from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.” —Num. 16:28-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Disobedience of King Saul .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is the case of Saul, the first king of Israel. This man was chosen by Jehovah God for his position. He was of magnificent appearance, head and shoulders taller than any of the people; and at the outset he was a man of modesty, for when they sought for him he had hidden himself among the baggage. But once installed in office, Saul became presumptuous, and in what he considered to be an emergency, took upon himself the duties of the priesthood, which he had no right to do. One wrong step leads to another; and when, later, he was directed to exterminate the Amalekites and had practically accomplished his mission he spared the best of the cattle professedly to sacrifice to the Lord, and also saved the Amalekite king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By these acts of disobedience he showed that he could not be trusted to do God’s will but desired to assert his own will and still to keep his position in God’s kingdom. It is not possible to do this. The spirit of the Lord departed from him; he lapsed into demonism, which was another act of disobedience; and finally died ignobly as a suicide upon the field of battle. Not only did Saul lose his life, but he lost his crown as well, and David was anointed in his room and stead. What a lesson this contains for the presumptuous !</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Presumption of Uzzah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There, is the case of Uzzah, son of Abinadab, the priest. There is no doubt that Uzzah was a good man. He had a great interest in the ark of the Lord, which represented, in Israel, the presence of Jehovah God. When the time came for this ark of the covenant to be carried to Jerusalem it should have been carried upon the shoulders of the priest’s. By an act of disobedience it was carried upon a cart; and the road was rough. When the cart jolted, Uzzah put forth his hand to steady the ark, and was s</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font6">tten dead for his error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Is the Lesson?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures tell us that the things that happened to fleshly Israel happened to them for ensamples and are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the ages are come. We have come to the time when the purposes of God are being fulfilled in the earth. His presence is with His people, and as all the above Scriptures, and many others which could be cited, plainly show, God has the absolute right and exercises the right to employ the instrumentalities that He will to accomplish His purposes; and we have full confidence that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the one and only instrumentality which the Lord is using to proclaim the kingdom of God in the earth at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As respects the dialogues of “Frank and Ernest”, it is a matter of record that these dialogues were broadcast for several years from Radio Station WBBR, the Watchtower; and it is as apparent that during those years “Frank and Ernest” were greatly used and highly honored by the Lord as it is that Nadab and Abihu, Miriam, the ten spies, Korah, Dathan and Abiram and their comrades, and Saul and Uzzah were used and honored before their deflections arose. But those who are wise toward God will now have nothing to do with “Frank and Ernest” or with the “Bible Students Radio Echo”, now that these men have ceased their association with the instrumentality God is using in the earth to perform His work at this time, and this regardless of what they broadcast, whether it be good, bad or indifferent. We are publishing this notice so that the feebleminded (1 Thess. 5:14) may not be deceived.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Reminiscences of the Aluminum Controversy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. C. T. Betts</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">BOUT five years ago, before any publicity upon aluminum poisoning from my pen appeared, I sought a hearing before the local medical fraternity. There was no thought of personal exploitation. I had something which had been of health value to myself and gave a new lease upon life. This was also of health benefit to about fifteen hundred of my patients during the twelve years that a clinical examination was under way. It was only after I was sure of my ground that a hearing before the medical fraternity was requested. No answer was received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time a number of patients had advised the president of the Toledo Medical Association that they had become well by discarding their aluminum cooking utensils. When I did not hear from the medics it was suspected that their silence was due to my so-called &quot;unethical act” of assisting their patients to better health without the consent of the M.D.’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following January, when new officers were elected, a similar request was made for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6">hearing, this time to one of my personal acquaintances. This plea met the same fate, silence. When no answer was received I judged that the medics were not as efficient as our fire department. It makes no difference whether a rich, poor, good or bad person calls them, they will respond within a few minutes to investigate if one really thinks he has a fire. Not so with the medical profession for health benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An investigation was now in order to learn if the same kind of treatment was accorded other persons than myself. Those men found none outside of the medical and chemical fraternities who were given any consideration whatsoever pertaining to anything that might be of health value to our citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the physicians belonging to the Association, who had given treatment during my illness, was invited to call at the office. I wished to show him what had added years to my life. This was about twelve years after he advised the good wife that I could not live longer than three months. He listened attentively to what was said, and when I concluded he merely asked, “What is the joke?” Then he admitted that he thought I had inveigled him into the office for the purpose of selling him some enamel manufacturer’s stock or other wares than aluminum. What he did not understand, and made no attempt to find out, was why I was still living or ■what was the cause of the recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it was found that the medics would not give a hearing, the little book called “An Opinion Upon Aluminum” was published. A prominent medic here who was not a member of the orthodox association read one of the first copies of the work. He belonged to the Association of Medico-Physical Research, one of the so-called “outlaws”. He demanded that I go with him to their convention in Chicago, occurring that very week, in September, 1926. About two hundred and fifty physicians, from all parts of America and Canada, attended. A private hearing was accorded me the evening before the convention, by its leaders, and an address was requested for the following day, to which I acquiesced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A copy of “An Opinion Upon Aluminum” reached the editor of the American Medical Association </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> almost immediately after the address. Dr. Fishbein wrote a most scathing denunciation of this work and myself, stating by innuendo that there must be some sinister or ulterior motive behind the publication, ‘which is unscientific in every respect and not worthy of consideration.’ This was published October, 1926, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> without any investigation whatever of the facts or having sent any person for an interview. I am informed that their investigators were sent here for the sole purpose of having me ousted from the dental union. I not being a member, they found it impossible to fulfill their mission. Instead, there were two pages published in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Toledo Medical Journal </span><span class="font6">of January, 1927, making an attempt to belittle me. Why did the medics take that action?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. E. J. Webster requested that am address be given in the First Methodist Church. He believed his and his wife’s illness were due to aluminum poisoning; the Toledo </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> December 13, 1925, gave a full report of the talk. Did any of the medics belonging to the society call or send a representative to see me upon what was published? No, they did not! They immediately got busy with the telephones, the doctors and chemists of Toledo held a mass meeting that Sunday afternoon for the purpose of placing a censor over the Toledo public press so that in the future all things medical would have to be O.K.’d by them before publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They roundly denounced me as a charlatan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">also a number of other names. Why did they not investigate? Did they do that? No! They were not interested in the facts, apparently, but only in the pocketbook. The next morning, Monday, December 14, they were in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">office, along with others of financial interests, making demand that Charles Howard be relieved of his position as managing editor. This was done at once; then further demands were made that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> retract everything printed and publish articles which the interests would furnish. This was done; the following Sunday, December 20, 1925, full retraction was made by this great daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The writer is informed that this sacrifice was necessary to appease the wrath of those present. What for? Not for the facts published, but because Mr. Howard allowed something to appear in his paper that stepped on Big Business’ toes. The editor had the report of the address upon his desk for two weeks before he passed it for publication. He first satisfied himself that everything was true as presented, before his action was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was of special interest to me to find Editor Fishbein and the high medical lights of Toledo severely denouncing me and my postulate as being Wholly unscientific from every standpoint’ and then to find that more than forty of the greatest scientists and biochemists belonging to the A.M.A. had given to our federal authorities in Washington sworn statements concerning aluminum poisoning; they never dreamed that the public would get their statements. This was convincing proof that the medical and chemical professions as a whole are keeping the truth and facts from the people for some purpose which they all seem to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Great commotion, consternation and threats were in evidence when it w<sup>T</sup>as found that I was about to quote them from the Federal Trade Commission’s Report, Docket Number 540, in my work “Aluminum Poisoning”. These letters are on file at the present time, some coming from as far away as London and Paris, sent by college professors vacationing in those cities. Don’t you think they were advised of my act and wrote their demands at someone’s behest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why don’t these physicians or biochemists belonging to the Association want the public to get that information ? Why is it that every civilized nation, excepting America, has laws prohibiting aluminum’s being placed in baking powders, condiments, etc., for public sale? Is it just to have laws on their statute books, or is it because they have long been familiar with the physiological effects of aluminum? Why is this the only country on the face of the earth allowing these poisons to be sold in such vast quantities with no protest from governmental authorities who know the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would like to ask several questions upon which I wish to be enlightened. Do you know of a physician who </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">knows</span><span class="font6"> how to vaccinate for the prevention of smallpox? Does he know just how many scratches to make ? How deep to make them? Does he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">know the</span><span class="font6"> exact effects upon every individual whom he vaccinates? Does he have any data whatever as to the physiological effects occurring after vaccination? Does he know if it prevents smallpox? Does he know what the particular vaccine he is using is composed of? Does he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font6"> anything about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the last several years about one hundred and eighty kinds of serums have been manufactured, for almost every kind of disease. They are also being recommended for the prevention of ailments. Does any physician </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">know </span><span class="font6">how serums affect the human body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Calmette poison, vaccine, toxin or antitoxin, as it may be called, is now recommended for the prevention of child tuberculosis. It is usually administered directly after the birth of the child. This poison was given a try-out upon a number of babies at Luebeck, Germany, recently, and seventy-four died within a few days. The injection was stated to have been done without the mothers’ consent or knowledge. Since this occurred a national American magazine devoted a whole page to the merits of the poison in preventing tuberculosis. I suppose Dr. Calmette is now 'working on a new kind of serum for babies. &quot;What are babies worth, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has not been so many years ago that the medics were all sure that blood letting or “cupping” cured disease. How long will the present manner of serumization be used before it will be found as great a fallacy as blood letting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The medical profession is a closed union for one purpose: the financial benefit to the members of the Association. Many prominent chemists are actually helping the medics to produce these poisons for injection into human creatures, and now the dental profession is working hand and glove with them for financial gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the light of these facts I ask, Who are the real charlatans, the ignorant, the wise guys and, last but not least, the bigots? How has the human race been able to exist without all the serums and vaccines during the last several thousand years? Are the chemists and doctors more efficient than God, or do they just think they are? All animals, all birds, all fish, reproduce their kind, live their alloted time, have their teeth, and health, and are normal in all instances, except where they have been corralled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mankind today would have just as nearly normal health in every respect as it had five hundred or five thousand years ago if the medics and chemists could possibly learn some of the laws of nature. Health is maintained by what we eat, drink and breathe; not by poisons or serums injected, which pollute the blood stream, or by the taking of drugs secured from a drug store. If the medics have their way we shall soon have state medicine, a Bureau of Human Industry right along by the side of the present Bureau of Animal Industry; then our citizens will be compelled to submit to the official doctor’s orders and pay the bill whether they want his services or not, with all that it implies toward vaccination, serumization and immunization. In the name of all that is good and true, would you expect me, or any other citizen who values his life, to trust the medical profession under such circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governmental officials are now taking steps to learn why the present prevalent condition of national ill health is as it is. Only a few months ago an appeal was sent forth to determine why such a great amount of medical service is required in America. Editors who have the interests of their constituents at heart have become frantic to know which way to turn for truth. They have been unable to secure it from the medical or chemical professions. Persons are getting tired of merely being cases, with no privilege of asking questions about their health welfare. The principal intelligence they are supposed to have is to be able to read the amount of the bill which is usually forwarded for professional services; they are supposed to understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People are turning to the so-called “cults”, vegetarians, chiropractors, neuropaths, osteopaths, etc., for health treatment. They are turning to magazines like </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, Health for All, Nature’s Path, The Quest,</span><span class="font6"> etc., for information because their editors see the light and have the privilege of using their judgment as to what is of health value. There are still members of the chemical profession who advise that all these should be choked off so that the public can receive no health information whatever except what the accredited authorities choose to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most editors are merely clerks who do the bidding of others; they are mere puppets who jump when the strings are pulled by those in financial, medical or chemical power. The public is being awakened to the danger when it sees what happened to Mr. Howard and others when they dared to print the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have too long listened to the little “god”, the doctor, who places himself upon such a high pedestal that few<sup>7</sup> of the common folks can now see him or reach his price. During the last fifteen years the public has been taught to listen only to so-called “authority”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have been misled by so many authorities that the public has become suspicious that science is only in the kindergarten, and that there is much yet to be learned and no special body of medics, biochemists or pharmacologists have a “corner” on brains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Over at Elkton, South Dakota, on February 20, 1931, about five hundred persons ate meat sandwiches. Not one suspected that they were anything but wholesome. Within three hours a large number of these persons, about two hundred and fifty, were affected severely with acute food poisoning. Many of these lost their eyesight temporarily, and the use of their limbs. More than one hundred and fifty received hospital treatment. Our investigation shows that the beef and pork had been cooked in a large aluminum kettle the day previous to the auction, ground fine, the gravy stored in the same utensil and reheated the following morning and poured over the meats, after which the buns were prepared and placed in cartons for the noon lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">None of these persons were told that their food had been cooked in aluminum utensils. No one suspected what was the cause of the illness, but they began dropping around on the ground like dead flies soon after eating this poison, without any mental attitude whatever as to the cause. This is happening in all parts of the country, and another one of exceptional note occurred in Vienna, Austria, just last week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> made a request for me to write my first article upon the aluminum question which appeared in their worthy magazine. Every bit of material that goes from this office for publication in various magazines and newspapers or for republishing purposes is either requested by the editor of the magazine or is sent upon a constituent’s request to forward such material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I wish to advise that I have a long list of such publishers now on my list and that on account of lack of time I am utterly unable to supply data or material as requested. I am practicing here in Toledo, and during my spare moments do what little I can upon this crusade for better health, yet I have frequently been charged with receiving large sums of money from the anti-aluminum interests or indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The federal authorities received a complaint that I had violated the Clayton Act. They made a thorough investigation of everything in my possession in the week of October 10, 1928. Mr. Horton was the examiner, and not one thing did they find here to suggest I had ever received from anyone any money or bond gifts upon this work. I charge nothing for my articles, advice, or answering the many inquiries that have come to my office, numbering thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. A department of state medicine is now proposed. In many states the medics already have full control of serumization and vaccination of the school child,- which they fully believe is within the province of the state. They have entirely forgotten that it is the school that is public, not the child. Under these circumstances search these men carefully and see if you cannot find the word “BIGOT” in large letters appearing before your eyes. That is the way it looks to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Americans Killing Their Own Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Reprinted from the Altamont (New York) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enterprise]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THREE” Americans by unquestioning submission to the arbitrary power of their government are forging chains that will bind their children. Their cousins, the Englishmen, are very jealous of their rights. When the government or agents of the law take liberties, there is an uproar that is heard around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Americans are different. They make laws to make themselves behave, and worry about the state of their neighbor’s soul. And because they are so awed by the government they have set up, and so docile in the presence of authority, men trusted with power have steadily increased their prestige until now they issue edicts as peremptory as those of a monarch without arousing either indignation or opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every year the power of the central government grows greater, and the foolish, foolish people adjust themselves to new restrictions and say nothing. They are blind. Their rights and their liberties are being taken from them one by one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They will awake some day, but it will be too late. Governments do not surrender power once assumed. The time will come in America—indeed it is almost here—when the government will issue arbitrary instructions, unsupported by law, and the citizen who dares to disobey will be thrown into jail without trial or recourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a Sickening Indictment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the New York dailies recently summarized the economic situation as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the cities millions of people have not enough to eat. In the country millions of farmers, facing ruin, are feeding dirt-cheap wheat to cattle, because they have no market. Around the world are hundreds of millions going almost naked while cotton planters are on the verge of starvation because they cannot sell their cotton. There is too much wheat, too much cotton, too much sugar, too much coffee, too much coal, too much oil, too much, almost, of everything. And yet, 1,500,000,000 people, three-fourths of the population of the globe, are half-naked and half-starved, yearning for the barest necessities of life but can’t afford them<sub>a </sub>What a sickening indictment of modern civilization!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tb** Waste Place Shall Rejoice’<sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By W. H. Barton {County Agent) &quot;The waste place shall rejoice, and the desert shall blossom as a rose.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE fulfilment of this prophecy has begun in A- Edgefield county, South Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Since the memory of man runneth not to the contrary” the use of legumes has been preached, but never adequately practiced in the South; and as a consequence, economic production has become more and more uneconomic, due to soil poverty. Those who are faithfully living up to a full utilization of this preachment are prosperous and satisfied, and might be said to “drink of the [financial] water of life freely”. I care not what we may do or may not do otherwise, in our farm practice, it will all be relatively unavailing unless our agriculture is based upon this foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I realize that this is a bold statement, but the past history of agriculture in the South when carried to the final analysis confirms my position. Dean Vivian of the Ohio State College of Agriculture wrote me a few years ago that “all the successful agriculture of the world has been built around the legumes”. This epitomizes the situation, not only for the South, but for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ivo rid!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Some Proofs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1908, the year before I was employed by the Extension Division of Clemson College to do “farm demonstration work”, I bought a badly rundown farm in my home county of Greenville, S.C., for $28 an acre, and was ridiculed as a fool for attempting to make a living where others had almost starved. I put the place under a three-year rotation of corn, cotton, and grain, with winter and summer legumes everywhere they could be stuck in. The result was that six years later I sold the farm for $135 an acre, and some one referred to it in the county paper as “the best farm in Greenville county”. I may be pardoned for this personal reference, as I want it distinctly understood that all my 21 years of farm demonstration work has been based upon my ability to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">do </span><span class="font6">what I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am ready to admit that many readers of what I shall say in this article will regard some of it as a “cock and bull” story. It is hard for the average Southern farmer to believe such modern miracles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a law of nature that productive soil must possess both fertility (plant food) and ability—• roughage which is just as necessary to the soil as to the cow. Legumes in a proper crop rotation, when turned under, will supply both, with the exception of acid phosphate and potash, both of which are relatively as cheap for the plant kitchen as soda and salt are for the farmer’s pantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Proofs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no more substantial, prosperous farmer in Edgefield county than B. R. Smith, commonly known as “Uncle Bob” Smith. For about twenty years he has been running a three-year rotation of crops with heavy plantings of cow peas to be turned under for soil improvement; and in recent years, soy beans on grain stubble and in corn middles, the seed of which is harvested with a horse-drawn harvester which leaves the vines on the land. “Uncle Bob’s” farm, about eighteen years ago, when I first saw it when visiting his farm as district farm demonstration agent of the Piedmont district, was a poor, white, sandy soil. Now the soil is a dark brown and produces an average of 40 to 50 bushels of corn an acre and approximately a bale an acre, average, of cotton. However, a few years ago, he grew over 100 bushels of corn an acre on 5 acres, has won two cotton contest prizes, and this year, on corn land with a heavy growth of soy beans in the middles, turned, he has growm 15,450 pounds of seed cotton on 5 acres, or 3,090 pounds of seed cotton an acre, on which he realized a profit of $193.49 an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now Listen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Uncle Bob’s” son, Jacob, planted 5 acres in the same field (just a cotton middle between them) on the brag acreage on which “Uncle Bob” had produced over 500 bushels of corn and on which he also won a state cotton prize; but Jake’s cotton followed cotton, and notwithstanding the fact that they fertilized the same, planted the same kind of seed, at the same time, and in every way handled them alike, Jake produced 1,550 pounds of seed cotton less than his father, and realized only $170.43 an acre profit. In other words, Jake just lost $23.06 an acre by following cotton with cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Uncle Bob” says that the soy beans in the corn the previous year made the difference in his favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">H. H. Herlong practices a rotation with legumes, and produced this year on 5 acres 12,162 pounds of seed cotton, on which he realized a profit of $98.28 an acre. Mr. Herlong lost a great deal by making his cotton rows 3| feet, instead of 3 feet as did the Smiths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lewis F. Holmes sowed a bushel per acre of velvet beans on 28 acres of deep “Black Jack” sand in 1928, and turned them the following fall and sowed rye as a cover crop. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This was part of the land he bought after it had made only 7 bales of cotton per 100 acres in 1927.</span><span class="font6"> He used only $13.15 wmrth of fertilizer per acre on the 28 acres, and produced 35 bales of lint cotton averaging 500 pounds each. His profit per acre -was $88.58. In the same field, after velvet beans turned under, Mr. Holmes sowed 8 acres to Fulghum oats in the fall of 1928, and harvested an average of 76.7 bushels an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">After vetch,</span><span class="font6"> this year, on 5 acres on an adjoining farm, Mr. Holmes produced 525.40 bushels of corn, 105.08 bushels an acre, at a profit of $106.41 an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a result of the Holmes demonstration, hundreds, if not thousands, of acres of velvet beans have been planted this year, and approximately 700 acres of “poor land” in the same vicinity have been bought because of this demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T. Pres. Lyon produced 78.60 bushels of corn an acre on 5 acres after turning vetch. He applied no fertilizer except 600 pounds of acid phosphate per acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following yields of corn </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per acre</span><span class="font6"> were made after turning vetch on 5 acres: D. T. Mathis, Jr., 52.78 bushels; Jas. M. Bell, 54.35 bushels; W. O. Holmes, 54.50 bushels; H. L. Corley, 78.05 bushels; T. P. Lyon, 78.60 bushels; J. V. Herlong, 82.79 bushels; L. Mike Herlong, 95.61 bushels; L. F. Holmes, 105.08 bushels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These yields w<sup>y</sup>ere on a shelled corn estimate, but no deduction has yet been made for moisture content. B. T. Lanham, with stable manure and commercial fertilizer, produced 79.40 bushels per acre. B. T. Boatwright, on rich bottom land, with fertilizer, produced 75.02 bushels per acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of Especial Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On L. Mike Herlong’s 5 acres, after a heavy crop of vetch turned under, he made a demonstration, using 200 pounds per acre of nitrate of soda on part, and no soda or other nitrogen than that supplied by the vetch, on the other part. A careful weighing of equal areas showed no difference in yield (both produced 95 bushels an acre), thus proving what Extension agents have been preaching for 20 or more years, namely: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Legumes can be made to cut out your nitrogen bill.”</span><span class="font6"> Even our friend, Mr. Cobb, saw this in a circular letter sent out by me, and in a letter to me says: “I am wondering if you meant to say what the statement seems to say.” Yes, Mr. Cobb, it is the plain, unvarnished truth, a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">modern miracle</span><span class="font6"> which might be placed in the same category with some of the miracles performed by the Master w<sup>T</sup>hen He w<sup>T</sup>as here the first time.

<p><span class="font6">II. L. Corley, after vetch, produced on 5 acres 78.05 bushels of corn per acre. He used 200 pounds of nitrate of soda per acre, but threw it away, judging from the results obtained by L. Mike Herlong and T. P. Lyon without any nitrogen applied where vetch was turned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My theory is that wnth a given soil and rainfall, corn is much like a mule: it will eat just so much to the stalk, and any surplus applied is a wmste of time and plant food. This principle has been observed by the writer for twenty-one years in demonstration work. About fifteen years ago, all the agents in South Carolina and about a thousand farmers from all over the state met at “Bob” Hodges’ Farm at Hodges, S. C., to look at more than 100 acres of cotton planted after turning crimson clover. Mr. Hodges showed vdiere he had top-dressed cotton with nitrate of soda at the rate of 1000 pounds per acre, and not one man of the thousand could defect any difference in the cotton. I could cite scores of like demonstrations which showed that a heavy growth of legumes furnished all the nitrogen needed to make a bumper crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is absolutely no excuse for any Southern farmer to cultivate “poor” land. God has created approximately 7,000 different kinds of legumes, and any section worth farming may be fitted up with one or more legumes that will succeed and render production most economic forthat section. Such legumes range from kudzu, the greatest pasture plant in existence, in my opinion, to Lespedeza, which grows wild and is foolproof, including a new <sup>+</sup>ype of perennial Lespedeza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All substantial buildings must rest on a firm foundation, including Southern agriculture, and God made the legumes for such foundation for agriculture, as has been amply proven. Seek first the glory of legumes, and all else worth while in successful agriculture will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I came to Edgefield county, about five years ago, winter legumes were not sown, velvet beans were neglected, if known, Lespedeza grew wild but no one respected it for that very reason, and soy beans were grown, not for soil building, but for the seed as a money crop; and my work was so unpopular that one farmer walked into my office a few weeks after my arrival, and threatened, “We’ll run you out of this county, sir!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, our best farmers utilize vetch to the extent of 20,000 to 30,000 pounds annually, soy beans generally, velvet beans have increased 1000 percent this season, and over two tons of Lespedeza hay have been produced per acre, and seed is being harvested by a few farmers. We find that, on the same land, Kobe Lespedezawill grow to three times the height of common Lespedeza. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five years ago we had about 12 pure-bred dairy sires. Now we have 48; and this year our farmers (less than a thousand in our little county who are land owners) have purchased: Cream separators, 12; farm tractors, 46; wheel cultivators, 114; mowing machines, 42; hay rakes, 42; threshing machines, 7; bean harvesters, 12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two on the D.D.’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Paul E. Saddlemire (New York}</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TXT’HILE colporteuring in the lower part of V V Albany county, I had some amusing ex</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">periences which I think are too good to keep to oneself, and which I should like to recite for the delectation of the readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one occasion, while I was trying to canvass a small village the town parson attempted to stop me by threats and warnings, etc. Seeing that I would not get scared or pay any heed, he then began to berate me and all other Bible Students, because of what we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A crowd collected, and the preacher then got upon the steps of a store, where he could overlook the crowd, and began to orate in a loud, blustering manner. I stood right at the foot of the steps where I had first met him and, though partly deaf, could understand some of the things that he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After raving for several minutes about the I.B.S.A. and its work, and after having called me and all other Bible Students all the names he could think of, this “bellowing bullfrog” then raised both of his hands toward heaven and cried in a long, loud tone of voice, “0 God, it gives me a pain in my soul—.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quick as a flash I exclaimed in a loud tone, “Whereabouts is that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this several of those standing by started to snicker, while others looked angrily at me, and the D.D. stopped talking and glared at me for a whole ten seconds without speaking, and then he roared, “Whereabouts is what?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And I replied, “'Your millions of nothing in a nutshell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this there was a roar of laughter from most of the people who were standing around, and the D.D., turning red in the face, shouted, “What do you mean, anyway, fiiutshell’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To which I replied, “What’s that on your shoulders ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a loud scream of laughter from the crowd at that, and the D.D. jumped down from the store step and beat it to his home without saying another word. This interchange of words so delighted some of the spectators that they purchased almost half of the books and booklets I had with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No doubt that preacher had expected me to get into a quarrel with him, or else lose my temper, and in either case make a poor impression upon those who were standing around. Hence he was not prepared for the way in which I did act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On another occasion I was canvassing an old gentleman who was both kind and considerate to me and to the message that I was trying to place in the hands of my fellow men. After some talk about the coming battle storm and what would follow, the conversation shifted around to the churches and the preachers; and the old gentleman then related the following incident:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the town where he lives, there was a preacher who owned a dog and who wished to procure a license and tag for same. Being unwilling to go to the expense of buying the license and tag, he asked his congregation one Sunday to get it for him. His congregation agreed and took up a collection and then put the job up to two elderly ladies to handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Accordingly, on the following Monday the two elderly ladies called upon the town clerk and told him that they wished to procure a license and tag for a dog. The town clerk got the license and tag and then asked in whose name he should make out the license. The two old ladies then told him that they wanted the dog tag for their preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old gentleman then remarked that it was not a bad idea at all for the church congregations to put tags on their preachers, because then if one of their preachers lied to them they would have his number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He then told me how, the winter before, in a church in another town, the D.D. of the church caused a show to be held in the church hall at which the church’s D.D. played the role of a big mastiff; and the old gentleman then told me that he had gone to the other town one night to see the show and that it was a scream to see the preacher go trotting about on the floor, dressed up like a dog and saying, “Bow! wow, wow, wow, wow! Woof! Woof!” and the old gentleman remarked that this was about the only kind of talk the preachers knew how to hand out nowadays and that some of them were sure leading a dog’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Once we would have thought Mr. Saddlemire pretty rough on the dominies, but experience in the field shows these men are worthy of no respect. They pose as ministers of Jehovah God, but in most instances are in very truth the ministers of the Devil and the greatest enemies of the God they pro</span><span class="font3">fess to serve.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">liciitov.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CC5</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Who Knoweth What Is Good for Man?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T WAS a quiet Sunday evening, and the clock in the belfry of one of our city churches was striking seven-thirty. Two friends were leisurely walking down the street. Suddenly they stopped in front of the church. “Well, MacDonald, this has been a hard week for me; I will try it again/’ At this MacDonald replied, “Well, Nelson, I’ll be back here at nine o’clock, about the time that the services are over.” The men parted. Nelson went slowly and somewhat indifferently into the church, while MacDonald went to the theater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both men had been working hard during the week and had found it difficult to support their families. Sickness had been a common experience, and these men were trying to find some degree of entertainment. Both were uncertain as to the future. Both were at their wits’ end as to what to do. They had sought advice from various sources. They had frequented churches time and again, but little or no comfort was given. It is indeed strange, with all the wisdom of this world, that there are very few who know what is good for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the appointed time MacDonald returned to the church building and met his friend, who was waiting there for him. “Well, MacDonald, it was the same old story again. The preacher started out well, but after that there seemed to be only confusion, no comfort, no hope. It seems as though things were getting worse.” To these words his friend replied, “Nelson, what do you mean by saying the preacher started out well but did not continue all right?” “Well, it’s this way, MacDonald. The preacher quoted a scripture and then proceeded to apply it to something entirely different from its purpose. It wasn’t very long before the sermon drifted to the wisdom of the workman’s being obedient to his employer regardless of how he is treated; regardless of whether he is able to earn a living or not, and to take the action as coming from the Lord. Anyone with common sense could see that if such were true the Lord would be responsible for all the oppression, extortion and cruelty shown by employers in every nation of the earth. That could not possibly be the application of the scripture ‘Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters’. He did not mention the fact that God rose up against the taskmasters in Egypt when they oppressed the Lord’s people there. He did not make mention of the fact that the Lord’s yoke is easy and His burden is light. The whole sermon seemed to justify the course of big business in its subtle oppression of the common people. There seems to be no hope for me. If this matter goes on it will mean the death of my family and desperation for myself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To these words MacDonald answered that while going to the theater he had met a man who approached him concerning a kingdom which the Lord had promised centuries ago. MacDonald was offered a book called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government, </span><span class="font6">which he eagerly purchased. It was during the first intermission of that night’s play at the theater that MacDonald read the first few pages of the book. He became so interested that the play did not mean much to him that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These men began eagerly to talk with each other. Questions were asked. What was the attraction that seemed to turn their minds? What was it that they had sought for during these many years and had apparently stumbled upon in a few minutes? MacDonald was sure that he had found the answer to his question, “Who knoweth what is good for man?” Reading in this book before he had come back to Nelson he found out the reasons why man is in a deplorable condition; why the human race must depend upon a higher power for their salvation than any man or group of men; why only Jehovah knows what is good for man, and that man’s obligation is toward his Creator. He read that man is imperfect and that therefore it is impossible for any law-making body of men to devise perfect laws. Since man cannot devise perfect rules of action, it is impossible for peace to result. Peace must stand upon the foundation of order and perfect laws. Then, too, man is impelled by selfishness, which is the ruling motive in the hearts of all but very few men. This being true, it is impossible for man to know what is either for his own best interest or for that of his fellows. In Jeremiah, the 10th chapter, verse 23, we read, “0 Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certainly there must have been a reason for man’s present deplorable condition. The cause of man’s suffering and sorrow may be traced back to the garden of Eden. After Jehovah, through His Son the Logos, had created man, He placed man in the garden of Eden and told him, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must have been very wholesome, because it was the creation of the Lord. The fruit itself would not bring death upon Adam, but the act of disobedience involved death. In this connection, too, the Lord could have made man without the ability to sin; but the Creator had a wiser purpose in making man with the faculty of choice, so that man could either choose to do that which is right and live or disobey his Maker and die. The Lord wishes His creatures to serve Him willingly, with a heart set upon pleasing the Lord. The obedience with a willing heart would indeed bring more pleasure to the Creator than compliance by a mere machine-like man who would not have the ability to discern that which is good and evil and who would be devoid of any choice in the manner of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The original man must have been happy in his perfect surroundings in Eden. Jehovah was his God. He knew the Lord, and he also knew what was pleasing to the Lord. He was given a beautiful wife as a companion. It was the purpose of the Lord to have a race of obedient creatures here on earth. The animals were obedient to Adam. The plants gave him food and the flowers shed sweet perfume to his pleasure. Man was in a perfect state. He had everything to make him contented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah placed a spirit creature named Lucifer over the first pair to protect them and to guide them in the path of truth. This spirit creature, Lucifer, was perfect and beautiful. His name signifies “light-bearer”; but the Scriptures have it that he became disobedient and betrayed the trust which Jehovah had given him. In Isaiah, the 14th chapter, we read of the ambition of Lucifer, who said, “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.” Lucifer wished a kingdom of his own, and he wished man to worship him instead of Jehovah. Lucifer manifested disorder, rebellion and sin against the Almighty. He came to Eve subtly and suggested that she eat of the fruit, and Eve told him what God had said: “Ye sha.ll not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, least ye die.” To this the serpent, which 'was now one of the new names of Lucifer because of his deflection, said, “Ye sh</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">all </span><span class="font6">not surely die.” This was an absolute contradiction of the plain statement of Jehovah. On this occasion Lucifer, who became “that old serpent”, which means “deceiver”, tried to make God out a liar; he tried to blaspheme the name and reputation of Jehovah; he tried to turn the mind of Eve, and subsequently that of Adam, away from the true God; and Jesus said that he was not only a liar, but a murderer. The account has it that Eve ate of the fruit and gave to her husband and he also ate thereof. This act of disobedience brought death upon the first pair. On account of the death sentence, all of Ada</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font6">’s children were caused to suffer. When the sentence of death began to operate upon Adam he became imperfect, and it was while in this imperfect state that he begat children. These children did not possess everlasting life, because' they too were imperfect; the imperfect father could not give perfect vitality to any of his children. Hence we read, in 1 Corinthians 15: 22, “In Adam all die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well to note in this connection that the name of one of God’s trusted agents was changed from Lucifer to that of Serpent, which means “'deceiver”. It was the serpent that deceived mother Eve, and deception has been one of the chief characteristics of the enemy down through the centuries. We also note that another one of the names of the enemy is Devil, which means “slanderer”. It has been the purpose of the Devil to slander the good name of Jehovah and to turn the minds of the people away from the true God. In Psalm 74, verse 10, we read, “0 God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?” Not only has the Devil used notorious criminals, but he has also more successfully used to his purpose the subtle influence of individuals who claim to be God-fearing men and who teach doctrines which really blaspheme the name of the Creator. Another name given to the common enemy is Satan, which means “adversary”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Zechariah 3:1 we read, “And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.” It was not only on this occasion that Satan opposed the agent of the Lord, but he has opposed and has been the adversary of every individual who has tried to live pleasing to Jehovah. The name Dragon also is an appellation of the wicked one. The term “dragon” means “devourer”. In support of this we read a portion of Revelation 12:4, which states that “the dragon stood before the woman which .was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born”. This scripture had application at the time of the beginning of the new nation of which Christ Jesus is Head. When the Lord gives names to individuals the names are significant and speak of the characteristics of the individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been the Devil that has placed the human race in its deplorable condition down through these centuries. Satan has held the minds and hearts of the human race in a viselike grip and completely in subjection. In 2 Corinthians 4:4 we read concerning the Devil, who is called “the god of this world”, that he “hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them”. Under this restrained condition and blinding influence it has been impossible for all excepting very few of the human race to know what is good for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan, knowing that man seeks to worship something and is not satisfied unless he worships the true God, has turned man away from the true God by every obstacle, invention, counterfeit and cruelty. When Abel sought to worship God, Satan put it into the heart of Cain to murder his brother. When the Israelites were led by the angel of the Lord through the wilderness he sought to turn their minds by the erection of the golden calf and other idols. A number of the Israelites, at the time of the birth of Jesus, desired to worship the true God, but Satan brought into existence a class of hypocritical religionists who pretended to be representatives of the true God. Jesus plainly stated, however, that they were of their father the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the time of Christ the message of truth has gone out concerning the true church, but the Devil has seen to it that several counterfeit systems were established in order to draw the people away from the worship that is pleasing to the Lord. Within recent years, at the beginning of the establishment of Christ’s kingdom, the Devil had so-called “Christian ministers” to proclaim the League of Nations as the kingdom of God on earth. The Devil instigated the faithless clergy of both the Catholic and Protestant church systems to preach the boys into war; and these preachers, above every other group of individuals on earth, have cast the blackest stain upon the pages of history by plunging millions of innocent boys into death, and bringing tears, sorrow, pain and poverty to the families of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the leaders of Christendom, who are under the influence of this mighty, unseen foe, are unable to help the people in desperation, it is little 'wonder they cry unto the Lord and say, “Who knnweth what is good for man?” It is absolutely necessary for man to seek other means of salvation and happiness than the wisdom of this world. The Devil has so bound up the systems of this -world that man must despair of help therefrom. The recent advances in knowledge, in inventions, and means of communication, have been brought about by the good influence of the Creator. It is His due time. But man, under the influence of the wicked one, has used these blessings to the oppression of his fellows. Machines come into existence and are used for the destruction of human creatures. New sources of pow<sup>r</sup>er are brought under the control of man, and a few individuals of the nation use these means to harness the masses and bring them into subjection. The powerful means of locomotion and of travel are held ■with an iron grasp, not for the benefit of others, but for the gratification of selfish desires and for the exploitation of the masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where shall man turn in his desperation? To whom shall he seek for help? Who has understanding and wisdom as to what is good for man? In answer to this question, we read in Psalm 118, verse 8, “It is better to trust in [Jehovah] than to put confidence in man.” They who put their faith in the Lord have a sure foundation, an unswerving guide and sure stay in every kind of trouble. To put confidence in man is to lean on a broken reed”. They -who put confidence in man rather than in Jehovah honor the creature more than they do the Creator. Since man is in a fallen and deplorable condition we can readily recognize why it would be futile to trust in man. Certainly the things of nature and the w’onders of creation show<sup>7 </sup>the superiority of the Creator. Jehovah’s thoughts must likewise be higher than those of man, and His-wisdom is unfathomable. In Isaiah 55: 9 -we read: “As the heavens are higher than</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways.” It is with confidence that man can trust in the Being who placed the stars and directed the course of the planets. It is Jehovah who is ever willing to show wisdom and truth to those who inquire of Him. In Micah 6: 8 we read: “He [Jehovah] hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” Before anyone can make any progress in the knowledge of the Lord he must love justice and truth. He must show compassion and mercy on those about him, and he must walk willingly in the ways of the Lord. True humility is teachableness in the way of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah knows what is good for man because His every action'is prompted by love. He made man for a definite purpose, and that purpose is to bring honor to his Maker. Jehovah can see through the centuries the destiny of the obedient of mankind. He has a broad comprehension of His own purpose and of what is best for man. At times the way of the Lord may seem hard and difficult, but if the individual is convinced that his course is directed by the Lord he docs wisely if he walks therein. On the other hand, the way of man might apparently be safe and the best course to take. Many are deluded by trusting in man, only to find disappointment. In Proverbs 14:12 we read, “There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” In words of certainty the Psalmist David spoke: “'0 taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trust-eth in him”; and again, in Psalm 85, verses 12 and 13, we read, “Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set us in the way of his steps.” In Ecclesiastes 2: 26 we read these assuring words: “God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We may now ask, What is Jehovah's provision for man? The provision would prescribe the purpose of man as well as the benefits that would be derived. Man’s purpose is to honor his Creator; by this is meant that man is to cooperate with the Lord in His great purpose concerning the earth. The obedient of mankind are assured life, endless joy and happiness. Recognizing that man is in a fallen state, the love of God has provided for the redemption of man through Christ Jesus. It was His Son who came into the world and gave His perfect human life as a substitute for the penalty that was placed upon Adam, thereby making it possible to bring back to life, again all who died on account of the sin of Adam. The majority of the human race have not as yet come to a knowledge of the truth. The billions of heathen who have gone down to the tombs have yet to learn the ways of the Lord. Jehovah has provided that “there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust”. This resurrection of all who are not Christians will mean the return of almost the entire human race to the earth. It was Jesus who said, in John 5: 28 and 29, “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.” Certainly there will be joy in the earth at the return of the loved ones. In Isaiah, the 35th chapter, verse 10, we read: “The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These scriptures bring to our attention that the dead are to return. It means, therefore, that the dead are coming back to where they have been before, even on this earth. The billions of humanity coming back to earth will learn the ways of the Lord for the first time. This will be their first opportunity to be placed on trial for obedience unto life. Those of the human race who are obedient to the Lord will obtain everlasting life on this earth, and all the joys that are incident thereto. In Psalm 37, verse 29, we read, “The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.” Certainly God purposes that the people shall have everlasting life, or they could not dwell in the land forever. In Proverbs 2:21 we read, “The upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There will be many coming back in the resurrection who have done that which is wrong, and who have done this ignorantly, not knowing that which is pleasing to the Lord. With words of encouragement the Lord speaks to these, in Ezekiel 18:21 and 22: “But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The QOLDEN AGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There will be some in the awakened masses of humanity who will persist in doing that which is evil. There are also some who may start out in the course of righteousness and yet fail under the tests that will be placed upon them, and who will turn their hearts to wickedness. What will become of this class who persist in wickedness? The Scriptures have it that they will be returned to the grave in the second death, from which there will be no recovery. In Ezekiel 18:20 we read, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Many will even rejoice in their wickedness, thinking that they are doing right, but they will be deceived, much as a drunken man in delirium tremens. In Jeremiah 51: 39 we read, “I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the Lord.” We hope that there will be only a small number of the human race that will lose the privileges given by the Lord and go into the class which will “sleep a perpetual sleep”. It can therefore be said with assurance that the Lord will abundantly reward the righteous, but all the wicked will He cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing, then, that the Lord has abundantly provided for the deliverance and happiness of the human race, we may ask, What will be the obligation of man toward the great Jehovah? Even now the Lord is giving the opportunity to men everywhere to turn toward Him and do that which is right. We are now living in “the day of the Lord”. It is right that man, and especially those who are His servants, should praise the Lord. When one comes to a knowledge of the truth he is obligated to tell the message of good cheer to others that they too might be benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time the Lord has a little band of faithful representatives in the earth who are making proclamation of Jehovah and His kingdom to the people. This class is bringing the message of comfort and good cheer; they are casting up the highway, so that the people of earth might know where to walk. They are the “remnant” of Jehovah’s “servant” yet on earth. In exultant terms they are saying, as stated by Isaiah, in chapter 12, verses 2 to 6: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this [make] known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the people hear this little band of God’s representatives yet on earth, they would do well to turn to the Lord, study the Bible with enlightened minds, set their heart upon God’s ways and tell others about the provision which Jehovah has made for man. The time must come when the people will speak about the Lord and His doings throughout all the earth. They will sing forth His praises and be a perpetual joy to their Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor Cullis and Mr. Chesterton</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TpVERYBODY likes to have nice things said about him. That is why Americans rather liked it when Professor Cullis, of the University of London, was reported as having said, in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of April 29, that “we had no idea that Americans were such charming and delightful people until we came here”. Nobody likes to have mean things said about him. That is why Americans rather wondered that Gilbert K. Chesterton, British novelist, was reported in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> as having said in London, on April 29, that on his return from America he felt as if he had just returned “from a different civilization or barbarism—whatever you call it”. Somebody must be lying, and it isn’t Professor Cullis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bemidji, Minn. “I have been listening to your regular Sunday morning talks on Bible truths for some time, and consider it one of the most helpful services I hear on religious topics.

<p><span class="font6">Pine Brook, N. J. “We have enjoyed hearing Judge Rutherford’s explanation of the Bible every Sunday and wish to express our sincere praise to God for so valuable teachings. We would like to get information about Judge Rutherford’s books, and also if we too could help distribute them. Do you have any services other than what you broadcast? If so, we would like to attend when possible.”</span></p>

I have only lately learned of you and your 'work. I listen in and thank God for you and pray him to bless you and your work at every opportunity. Would like to 'know more about your teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">San Francisco, Calif. “It has given consolation to me to listen to your Sunday morning radio addresses. I have a small head phone which, makes me rise early on Sunday mornings to get the benefit of great minds over the air— which wonder I never cease to marvel at.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Colo, Iowa. “I heard J. F. Rutherford over the radio and I enjoyed his talk. I never wanted to hoar anything so much in my life. About twelve years ago I lived by an old man; he gave me some lectures and I was greatly interested. He died. I moved away and I never heard any more lectures of the kind until the one I heard this morning. I was raised, as many others, to go to church and listen to the preacher. I joined the church, but never was satisfied. I could not see how God would have eternal torture. J. F. Rutherford’s talk was what I wanted to know.”</span></p>

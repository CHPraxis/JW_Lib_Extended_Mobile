When these things begin to eome to pass, then know that the Kingdom of God is at hand.

<p><span class="font12">THIS JOURNAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ITS </span><span class="font7">SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">classes </span><span class="font6">by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">columns are not </span><span class="font6">open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font6">JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font6">GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font6">JESUS was made </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">human being in order that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font6">THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font6">THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that the kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel of the kingdom must be preached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO AND THE PRINTED WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All canvassing parties and all individuals who canvass should mention the radio station in their vicinity that is broadcasting the watchtower programs. This often proves a means of opening the way to place the books in the hands of the people. Have in mind the chief purpose of the radio is to call the people’s attention to the truth and then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding of the message concerning the government of Jehovah by reading what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every one who now participates in the field work in territoiy served by broadcasts of the watchtower program may have a share in telling the people that this unique service is available each week. Workers report that distribution of the radio folder (supplied by the Society) is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font6"> public notice of this program while engaging in the house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">with bread.”—Ps. 132:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lord would have done; but each progressive step made the matter clearer, and the Lord indicated what should be done and added his blessing. From the beginning it was determined that it should be a service convention and that no time or effort should be wasted in unnecessary or frivolous things. Preparation was made to this end. Every member of the Bethel family, office and factory force at Brooklyn and Toronto was assigned to some specific duty, and each one performed his or her part. Three days in advance of the opening of the convention a special train carried a hundred of the Bethel family of Brooklyn to Columbus to complete the preparations to receive the multitude. Two days later the remainder of the force at Brooklyn, and all the Toronto force, moved to the site of the convention, and everything was in readiness to receive the crowd as it came. Even weeks before that many colporteurs began long and tedious journeys by house motor cars and other means of travel in order to reach the ground in time to participate in the convention at the beginning. The convention opened exactly on time and moved forward each day with the precision and unity of a well organized and oiled machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pioneers are those who go into isolated parts of the land where there are no classes and who bear the fruits of the kingdom to the people in such places. That the Lord has great love for these there cannot be the slightest doubt. No one is compelled to become a pioneer. The inducement is love for Jehovah and his kingdom which will vindicate his name. Anyone who goes into the work and continues with that unselfish motive never has cause to regret it. The promise of our Lord to his followers is that “every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life”. (Matt. 19:29) The Lord has made good this promise to those who have entered the pioneer field. Seeing the great privilege of engaging wholly in the Lord’s service a goodly number of the anointed have during the past months given up comfortable homes with attending creature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH faithfully performs every promise he makes. The promise of the above text is to Zion, which is his organization; and since the Scriptures were written for the members of Zion on earth at the end of the world, we have the assurance that the promise is specifically for the remnant. Every one of the remnant can bear testimony to the fact that during the past year or more Jehovah has abundantly blessed the provision for his people who are his witnesses. For these he has prepared a table in the presence of their enemies and has laden that table with an abundance of supplies for the comfort of those who love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three years had passed since Jehovah’s people had assembled in America in general convention. Some of the anointed were becoming footsore and somewhat weary in well-doing. The Lord knew the need of his anointed, and the encouragement that was necessary for their well-being. Within those three years the faithful had observed many falling away under the deceptive influence of the “man of sin” because such had not received the love of the truth. Some in the ranks began to doubt whether or not they were in the favor of the Lord. “Unto Jehovah belongcth loving kindness,” and he has in mind those who love him. He makes it possible for each one of his anointed to examine himself and to determine from the Word of God and attending circumstances whether or not he is in the faith and therefore in the favor of the Most High. In the exercise of his loving-kindness and in his own good time and way Jehovah provides a feast for his people, and he brought them together in convention that they might feed upon the bountiful provision made by him and rejoice and grow strong. That occasion was the general convention of the anointed of the Lord held at the State Fair Grounds at Columbus, Ohio, July 24-30, 1931. There are several reasons why that convention can hardly be compared with other conventions, and it is only true to say that it was the best convention ever held on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of the year it was determined that a general convention should be held in harmony with Jehovah’s ■will. Preparation therefor immediately began. At first it was difficult to see just what the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">comforts, moved out into the field, and given themselves entirely over to the active service of bearing the message of the kingdom to the people. Some have found it necessary to leave father, mother, brother, sister or wife, and sometimes the entire family has gone together. A number of these have built on wheels a house sufficient to accommodate several and, taking with them their children, have left everything else behind, and now go to whatsoever part of the country to which they are assigned and delight to participate in the work. Others have left all things mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the foregoing text and have gone into action in the field of joyful service, and the Lord has blessed their efforts abundantly. Many of the pioneers carry with them tents in which they sleep, and when the weather permits many of them sleep out in the open. The most necessary creature comforts are these: food, raiment, shelter and health. The frugal and simple mannei' of living has made many of these colporteurs physically much stronger than they were previously. Their children are in good health and, living in the open and next to nature, are greatly blessed in a physical way. These pioneers by the Lord’s grace have been able to provide food and raiment for themselves and their dependent ones, and, above all, they enjoy the blessed peace of mind and contentment that comes to only those who are striving to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ample provision was made at the Fair Grounds for the camping of those who desired to avail themselves of such accommodations. Upon this camping ground the pioneers pitched their tents and parked their cars. Approximately fifteen hundred were encamped in this manner, and their tents and housecars were so arranged in blocks or squares, with well laid-out streets between, that it gave the appearance of an encamped army and the suggestion of how the Israelites, marching to the land of Canaan, must have appeared when they encamped for rest and refreshment. These pioneers had been on a long trek, and each one had his heart set on reaching the convention; and now their weary journey had ended and they were encamped for rest and were ready and anxious to receive the abundant provision Jehovah had made for them. They were a happy company. These are “poor in spirit’’; that is to say, they do not think too highly of themselves, but think of themselves properly, and they have not too much of earthly things; and it should be expected that the Lord would fulfil to them his precious promise, to wit, “I will satisfy her poor with bread.” This means that he would make ample provision for the sustenance, strength and encouragement of them as his representatives. Truly the Lord fulfilled his promise to them and to all others of like precious faith attending the convention. Early Friday morning the little army of pioneers had set up their miniature city on the site provided for them and near the Coliseum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of other faithful ones began pouring in at every gate or entrance to the grounds. Hundreds of private automobiles brought loads of devoted ones to the convention, while special trains and electric cars brought many others. The assembled company numbered approximately seven thousand when the convention opened, and by Sunday noon the attendance had grown to fifteen thousand or more. The main auditorium was unable to accommodate all attending. A public-address system of voice amplifiers was put in the main auditorium, enabling all there to hear. Likewise the voice amplifiers were extended to the main dining hall and to the grand stand, the two latter places accommodating fully six thousand persons. Still others were provided with loud-speakers, that they might sit under the trees on the grounds and hear. It was truly a division of the Lord’s army encamped for rest and refreshment and to learn more fully God’s purposes concerning them and the work the members thereof must do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE TO CHRISTENDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why would the Lord God bring together a large company of his anointed ones just at this time! Would it be merely for the purpose of refreshing themselves, to see each other and discuss certain Bible texts? That would not seem to be the chief reason, in view of the present work that must be done on earth. We know now that the great issue before all creation is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and that he has already assembled ‘his troops on mount Zion’. (Mic. 5:1; Rev. 14:1) Armageddon is near, when Christendom and all of Satan’s organization are certain to fall. But before the Lord smites the enemy he will have notice served upon the enemy organization. As Jehovah caused his prophet and servant Ezekiel to serve notice upon Jerusalem before its destruction, even so now he causes his anointed servant class on earth to serve notice upon Christendom, which Jerusalem foreshadowed; and this notice must be served before Christendom’s destruction. It is certain from the Scriptures that the Lord has assigned to the remnant the duty and the great privilege of serving such notice. It is to be expected that the Lord by his angels would indicate to the remnant on earth what notice should be served upon Christendom. God’s people can always depend upon his making every necessary provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the year the notice in the form of a resolution and a supporting argument thereof was prepared. These, together with a message concerning the kingdom of God as the only remedy for the world, were put in book form. Before the convention opened 750,000 copies of this booklet were made ready, and these were placed at vantage points at Columbus and other cities to which the convention was extended. Everything was in readiness for the beginning of the distribution of the message when the time should arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manner of giving notice to the people quickly was another problem. The Lord God has provided the radio, but Satan’s organization desperately attempts to control the radio and to prevent the message of the kingdom from being broadcast. The radio monopoly of Satan’s organization, which owns and controls the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System, after much bickering absolutely denied the use of their facilities to the Lord’s people for the broadcasting of the message. The arm of the Lord is not made short, however. His consecrated ones began action to build up a radio chain broadcasting network to send forth the message from Columbus. Many hours of tedious work was faithfully performed and by the Lord’s grace resulted in the greatest radio chain broadcast of any one program that has yet been put on the air. Quoting from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company this is corroborated: “This particular network is the largest individual network that has ever been on the air.” The National Broadcasting Company and its allies thought that this could not be done, but with the Lord nothing is impossible. By the use and means of telephone wires one hundred and sixty-three radio stations situated in the United States, Canada, Cuba and old Mexico, were tied together and simultaneously broadcast the “Warning” and message from the Coliseum at Columbus at the appointed time. In addition thereto short-wave radio channels carried the message across the seas. The one hundred and sixty-three radio stations thus tied together employed 24,700 miles of program circuits, and 50,000 miles of coordinating telegraph circuits. Along the way at different points 250 “repeaters” were used, and special amplifying apparatus maintained the high standard of transmission, thus making it possible to have a uniform transmission throughout the entire network. A company of between 900 and 1,000 men were used by the telephone company to properly handle the broadcasting and wire facilities. Private telephone wires reaching all points of the network were also used, with many operators keeping in constant communication as to the manner of the broadcast. Before the program was opened the entire system was tested out, and from every part of the great field the report came that the mighty machine was working perfectly and that even the weather was very favorable. We are certain that the Lord had his angels looking after the matter. The enemy was powerless to prevent the program from being given to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exactly at twelve o’clock noon the program began. Microphones had been located at vantage points throughout the large auditorium to pick up the song of the multitude. Led by an orchestra and a chorus of 400 voices the program opened with a song of praise to Jehovah, “Holy, Holy, Holy.” The words of the song were printed on more than six million folders and previous to the convention were distributed to the people throughout the United States and Canada, and doubtless multitudes of the unseen audience joined in the song of praise. May we not well suppose that the hosts of heavenly angels at the same time sang to the glory of the Most High?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the soul-stirring song died away the great audience became immediately quiet. Announcement was made over the vast network, and then the message “The Kingdom, the Hope of the World” was spoken over the network; and from the extreme northeastern point of Canada, across the continent, along the entire Pacific coast from British Columbia to old Mexico, and in every state in the United States, and in old Mexico, and in Cuba, the people simultaneously heard the message. Immediately following the address, and as a part of the broadcast, the speaker read a resolution of warning to Christendom and then called upon the audience seen and unseen to vote for its adoption. The entire visible audience rose enmasse and shouted “Aye”. Telegrams received from all parts of the land stated that many of the unseen audience likewise arose and voted for the adoption of the resolution. The public address or argument in support of the resolution and the resolution are printed in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World;</span><span class="font7"> for the purpose of preserving the record we here insert the resolution, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING FROM JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the Rulers and to the People:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be it known: That there is but one true and Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, the Most High; that there is but one Redeemer of man, whose name is Christ and whom God has anointed and installed as King of the world; and that his Kingdom is now come, and is the hope of the peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Satan, the Devil, is the great enemy of God and of man. For centuries he has been the invisible ruler of the world, and has brought great reproach upon the name of God and has led men into degradation; that the condition of suffering and distress now in the earth is due to the wickedness of Satan and his agents; that the time has come, as God declares, when Satan’s rule shall for ever end; that in 1914 Satan was cast out of heaven down to the earth; that within a short time from now Jehovah by Christ will destroy Satan’s power and organization in the earth; that before so doing, however, it is the expressed will and commandment of Jehovah God that his message of warning shall be delivered by his witnesses to the rulers and to the people in order that those who hear may have an oppoitunity to take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom and thereby find refuge in the time of trouble; that the testimony of warning that must be given is, in brief, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The leading nations of the earth which claim to be Christian nations, and which are therefore called “Christendom”, have defamed and reproached the name of Jehovah God, and are a part of Satan’s organization and shall suffer destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other nations, called “heathen”, have also reproached God’s name, are a part of Satan’s organization, and shall also fall. God has given “Christendom” more enlightenment and greater opportunities than the heathen, to all of which “Christendom” has proven unfaithful, and therefore she shall suffer </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">greater punishment </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">the hands </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah. Within </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">short space of time there shall come upon “Christendom”, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font6">is called by the name of the Lord, the greatest tribulation that has ever befallen any people.—Jer. 25: 29-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To enable the people to better understand God’s reason for bringing this tribulation upon the nations the history of the Jews was caused to be recorded in the Bible and is here mentioned. The Lord has declared that what happened to the Jews typified and foreshadowed what shall come upon “Christendom”, or the professed “Christian” nations of the world. The Jews were God’s covenant people, but they became unfaithful to their covenant and turned to idolatrous practices. God sent his prophets, who warned the Jews of his purpose to destroy their nation because of unfaithfulness. The leaders amongst the Jews ignored the warning, scoffed at the testimony of God’s prophets, and then falsely prophesied to the people that no harm was coming to that nation. But shortly thereafter the Jewish nation was swept out of existence. That history is being repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JEHOVAH planted true Christianity as a pure and noble thing, but shortly after the death of the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ the commercial and political rulers of the world, aided and abetted by the clergy, adopted “Christianity” and called it their religion, and then changed the ordinances of God to suit their own selfish purposes, broke the laws of God, and particularly ‘ ‘ the everlasting covenant ’ ’, and have brought great reproach upon the name of the Most High. Today the leading nations of the world are called “Christian”, and they practice a formalism of religion which is called “the Christian religion”, whereas the leaders thereof deny the inspiration and truthfulness of God’s Word, deny the blood of Jesus Christ as the redemptive price of mankind, and deny God’s kingdom as the means of restoring and blessing the peoples of earth. “Organized Christianity,” therefore, is an integral part of Satan’s organization and is against God and his kingdom, and hence must be destroyed in order that the kingdom of righteousness may rule the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War came in 1914, with its attending distressing conditions, and in exact fulfilment of the prophecy of Jesus Christ, and furnished the complete proof to all “Christendom”- that the world had ended and that Christ’s kingdom was at hand. (Matt. 24: 3-14) These facts were especially called to the attention of the leaders of “Christendom”. Had “Christendom” then given heed to the counsel of God and stood in his Word she might have been spared from destruction. Not only did “organized Christianity” treat the counsel of God with contempt, but she openly endorsed the Devil’s make-shift and called it the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. “Christendom’s” leaders and commercial, political and religious prognosticators now freely predict that the present condition of suffering and distress is but temporary and will soon pass away and that the nations ruled by unrighteous men will soon establish lasting peace and prosperity. Like the false prophets to the Jews, these presentday predictors prophesy falsely. (Jer. 28: 1-17) Let the people take notice that “Christendom” will never recover, but soon will go down in the worst tribulation that has ever befallen any nation of the world. Her destruction will not come by the poor people fighting against the rich, but will result from the punishment inflicted by Jehovah God and his King.—Bev. 19:11-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah declares that there shall be such a great number of people slain in the time of trouble that the survivors will not bury them; but further states that some portion of the people will be spared, taken through the trouble and saved; and that the ones spared will be those who now seek to know and to do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The hope of the world is God’s kingdom, and there is no other hope.</span><span class="font6"> Immediately following the great tribulation Jehovah’s kingdom will establish peace and prosperity in the earth. All order-loving people should therefore be diligent now to learn of and concerning the kingdom of God, and should take their stand on the side of his kingdom and give their allegiance to God and his King and thus put themselves in line for the everlasting blessings that shall come to those who are obedient and faithful to Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This testimony of warning is not given by “another religious cult that is engaged in propaganda or in proselyting”. It is given by Jehovah’s witnesses. Those who give this testimony do not seek members or solicit money. Upon all those who have wholly devoted themselves to his kingdom, Jehovah has laid the obligation to give this testimony of warning. The responsibility is upon these witnesses to give the testimony and warning, and those who hear are responsible to God for what course they take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We declare our allegiance is wholly to God and his kingdom, and we delight to be his witnesses and to bear his testimony to the honor of his name. Our faith forbids and precludes us from engaging in war or in any other enterprise that would work harm or injury to mankind. We are for Jehovah’s kingdom of everlasting peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The time is due for the vindication of Jehovah’s great name, and as his authorized witnesses, and in obedience to hi3 commandment, we do now solemnly declare this warning and deliver this testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within a very short time God will destroy all of Satan’s organization, which includes “Christendom” and all the nations that oppress the people and defame his name. Immediately following that great destruction, God by Christ will fully establish his government of righteousness in all the earth. Let the people therefore cease to give heed to schemes of reform brought forth by men. The kingdom of Jehovah God is the hope of the world. Let all who love righteousness give full allegiance to Jehovah and to his kingdom and receive his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some weeks in advance of the convention a special electrical transcription record of the public address was prepared and sent to radio stations of America and in foreign lands; therefore in addition to the 163 radio stations tied together by means of telephone wires, as above mentioned, over three hundred other radio stations broadcast the message by electrical transcription. In Australia fifteen radio stations were tied together by means of 5,000 miles of telephone wires, and these fifteen stations simultaneously broadcast the message by electrical transcription. A cable from Australia announced that the broadcast by these fifteen stations was perfect and was heard throughout the land. Other radio stations in Paris, France, and Tallinn on the Baltic sea, heralded the message </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font7">the hour. The preachers of ecclesiastical England kept the message off the air and thus deprived the good people of that land of the opportunity of hearing, but they will have to receive it in another manner. The enemy is helpless to now prevent the people from receiving the notice of warning and the message of the kingdom. By his grace the army of the Lord will carry the message to every part of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sunday afternoon, July 26, at 4 p.m., there was presented and read before the convention the following resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A NEW NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whereas about 1874, in fulfilment of divine prophecy, the Lord Jesus Christ began the work of ‘preparing the way </span><span class="font6">before Jehovah’ and to restore to his faithful followers on earth a clearer understanding of the fundamental truths taught by Jesus and his apostles and which for centuries had been made obscure by others teaching false doctrines; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whereas from and after that date and for a period of more than forty years Charles T. Bussell, a faithful follower of Christ Jesus and a servant of Jehovah God, led a company of his brethren in Christ in the preaching and teaching of the divine Word, and particularly with reference to the second coming of Christ, the setting up of his kingdom, and the restoration of man to perfection on the earth; and to carry on said work orderly said company of Christians organized the corporations known as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the International Bible Students Association, and the Peoples Pulpit Association; and they used and now use these corporations for the publication of books, magazines and other Bible literature; and in the course of time said company of Christians became known by such names as, to wit, ‘</span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Russellites, ” “Millennial Dawn People,’’ “International Bible Students Association,’’ and other like names; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whereas shortly following the death of Charles T, Russell a division arose between those associated with him in such work, resulting in a number of such withdrawing from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and who have since refused to cooperate with said Society and its work and who decline to concur in the truth as published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and the other recent publications of the said above-named corporations, and have opposed and do now oppose the work of said Society in declaring the present message of God’s kingdom and the day of the vengeance of our God against all parts of Satan’s organization; and said opposing ones have formed themselves into divers and numerous companies and have taken and now bear such names as, to wit, ‘ ‘ Bible Students, ’ ’ “ Associated Bible Students,” “Russellites teaching the truth as expounded by Pastor Russell,” “Stand-Fasters,” and like names, all of which tends to cause confusion and misunderstanding:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, therefore, in order that our true position may be made known, and believing that this is in harmony with the will of God, as expressed in his Word, be it resolved, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> we </span><span class="font6">have great love for Brother Charles T. Russell, for his work’s sake, and that we gladly acknowledge that the Lord used him and greatly blessed his woik, yet we cannot consistently with the Word of God consent to be called by the name “Russellites”; that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association and the Peoples Pulpit Association are merely names of corporations which as a company of Christian people we hold, control and use to carry on our work in obedience to God’s commandments, yet none of these names properly attach to or apply to us as a body of Christians who follow in the footsteps of our Lord and Master, Christ Jesus; that we are students of the Bible, but, as a body of Christians forming an association, we decline to assume or be called by the name “Bible Students” or similar names as a means of identification of our proper position before the Lord; wo refuse to bear or to be called by the name of any man;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That, having been bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer, justified and begotten by Jehovah God and called to his kingdom, we unhesitatingly declare our entire allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom; that we are servants of Jehovah God commissioned to do a work in his name, and, in obedience to his commandment, to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known to the people that Jehovah is the true and Almighty God; therefore we joyfully embrace and take the name which the mouth of the Lord God has named, and we desire to be known as ami called by the name, to wit, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses.—</span><span class="font6">Isa. 43:10-12; 62:2; Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses our sole and only purpose is to bo entirely obedient to his commandments; to make known that he is the only true and Almighty God; that his Word is true and that his name is entitled to all honor and glory; that Christ is God’s King, whom he has placed upon his throne of authority; that his kingdom is now come, and in obedience to the Lord’s commandments we must now declare this good news as a testimony or witness to the nations and inform the rulers and the people of and concerning Satan’s cruel and oppressive organization, and particularly with reference to “Christendom”, which is the most wicked part of that visible organization, and of and concerning God’s purpose to shortly destroy Satan’s organization, which great act will be quickly followed by Christ the King’s bringing to the obedient peoples of earth peace and prosperity, liberty and health, happiness and everlasting life. That God’s kingdom is the hope of the world, and there is no other; and that this message must be delivered by those who are identified as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We humbly invite all persons who aie wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom to join in proclaiming this good news to others, that the righteous standaid of the Lord may be lifted up, that the peoples of the world may know where to find the truth and hope for relief; and, above all, that the great and holy name of Jehovah God may be vindicated and exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then followed an argument setting forth scripture upon scripture in support of the new name, proving from the Scriptures that it is the will of God that his people shall be called by a new name in order that they may stand out separate and distinct from the other peoples of the earth. The argument in support of the resolution will appear in full in another issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font7"> The resolution appears in this report to preserve the record thereof. Without a dissenting voice the resolution was adopted amidst great enthusiasm and rejoicing. It was really the beginning of a new day for God’s anointed people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be Jehovah’s witnesses means that the anointed ones have received ‘the white stone with the new name written therein’, and discloses a blessed relationship enjoyed by the remnant with Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ. (Rev. 2:17; 3:12) By giving his people a new name Jehovah has branded his people so that there can be no mistake as to their identity. These will henceforth stand out separate and distinct from all professed followers of Christ Jesus. Every one who really loves God must be his witness; and to be the witness of Jehovah means to serve the notice of Jehovah upon Christendom of his purpose to destroy her, and also the message declaring Jehovah’s kingdom and the vindication of his holy name. No wonder the convention went wild with enthusiasm. On every hand the Lord's people there were heard to say: “We have been waiting for something of this kind, so that we could be clearly discerned from those who claim to be servants of God. Now we arc happy, because we know who we are and where we are, and we can go forward with renewed zeal and energy.” Necessarily the adoption of the resolution was the peak of the convention, because the anointed realized the warmth of Jehovah’s love bestowed upon them. Now by the Lord’s grace the anointed have a name that no others want. Those who have been opposing the Society and its work cannot take that name, because if they do they thereby declare themselves to be Jehovah’s witnesses and prove that they have been wrong in opposing the witness work. These opponents have repeatedly stated that the Society is a bookselling scheme, and if they now take the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” they brand themselves with the brand which Jesus said he would give them, to wit: “Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.” —Rev. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let the anointed witnesses of Jehovah now push on with the work to his honor and glory. Let them give no heed whatsoever to the slanderous or abusive words of the opposition. We have no fight with any individual. We have no time for argument with those who oppose the Lord’s work. They cannot prevent the work, and to argue with them merely wastes good consecrated time. The anointed are now determined to obey the admonition given by the Lord’s Word in Romans 16:17,18: “Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; AND AVOID THEM. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the .hearts of the simple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The I.B.S.A., which is in brief the name for the International Bible Students Association, is the name of the corporation and to which the Society holds title, and no one has a right to that name except the Society owning the corporation. That corporate name will continue to be used for the purposes for which the corporation was organized. As to the Lord’s anointed, henceforth they will be known and designated in all advertisements of meetings, for conventions and for other work, as Jehovah’s witnesses. By this means the people will come to know that Jehovah God has a people on earth who delight to represent him and to honor his name and to hold aloft his banner of righteousness. Not only was the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” joyfully received by those at the convention, but immediately following the adoption of the resolution the Lord’s anointed began to remove from their motor cars the letters I.B.S.A. and to put thereon instead the letters J.W. When they ran out of paint they even marked J.W. in the dust on their cars. As they went forth to canvass in the field they spoke of themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses. They delight to bear this name because the mouth of Jehovah has thus named them.—Isa. 62: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fire of the enemy will now be concentrated upon Jehovah’s witnesses, because these are they who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and who keep the commandments of Jehovah God. (Rev. 12:17) The opposers, acting under the direction of Satan, will indulge in all manner of slanderous and malicious statements against the anointed; but the more this is done the greater will be the proof that the Lord’s anointed ones are truly the representatives of Jehovah. This will draw the attention of the people to them; and the peoples of good will and who desire righteousness will see that Jehovah has a people in the land, even as the people of Israel recognized that there were prophets amongst them. What a blessed privilege now to be a witness for Jehovah. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses must be clean in every respect and must be fully and completely separate from all others. They are in the world, but no part of it. As Esther and Mordecai were in due time caused to be fully identified before the people as Jews, even so now the remnant of the Lord must be and are identified as those who give praise to the name of Jehovah God and tell the people of his kingdom. There must be and is now an absolute unity of the anointed, and from henceforth let these march forward proclaiming the kingdom to the honor of Jehovah’s name. They are absolutely certain of victory, because Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer is leading them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the men described by the Prophet Ezekiel in the ninth chapter went in before the altar and registered for service, so likewise the anointed of the Lord as they arrived at the convention registered for service. All motor cars were registered, numbered and put into the service. Beginning with Monday all the days of the convention following were field service days. The service department was well organized, and under the leadership of captains of companies practically everyone at the convention engaged in the field service. There was scarcely sufficient territory to give everyone service at all times. Columbus and the vicinity for fifty miles around was well covered and served by the workers. Like other parts of the country the economic conditions in that vicinity are bad and the people in much distress, while the clergy busy themselves in an attempt to prevent the people from hearing the truth. This handicap did not prevent the message from getting to the people, however. In some of the towns the clergy went through the streets in a body and warned the people to give no heed to the witnesses of Jehovah; but instead of heeding the clergy the people were even more anxious to know, and many of them took the books. In some of the towns the clergy held indignation meetings, denouncing the convention and declaring that “the work of these people must be destroyed”. The clergy have begun too late. A brief synopsis of the work done in the field is given as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Workers--------7,231</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Testimonies----------------------- 391,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Books and booklets placed_____________ 390,126</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World, </span><span class="font7">containing the Warning to Christendom, must be distributed throughout Christendom. The purpose is to put all the machines to work until the message in the various languages has reached Christendom. Jehovah’s witnesses will gladly do this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A discourse was delivered to the convention dealing with the thirty-fifth chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah, which discourse was entitled ‘‘Remnant to the Front”. Under this title the discourse in full will appear in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font7"> Suffice it here to say that it was pointed out as an indisputable fact that the remnant must now take the lead on the highway or great high road and lift up the standard of the Lord to the people so that all of good will may take their stand on the side of Jehovah. This greatly enthused the workers because it points out to them definitely what work is to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">VINDICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the conclusion of a discourse dealing with the ninth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy, concerning the man with the writer’s inkhorn, the convention was informed that a new book entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> was now off the press and that the autograph edition was ready for distribution. This announcement was received with great enthusiasm because the consecrated have long looked to the Lord to send some explanation of Ezekiel’s prophecy. This book of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font7">treats the first twenty-four chapters of Ezekiel’s prophecy. It discloses the judgments of Jehovah written against Christendom and shows that his witnesses must now serve notice upon Christendom that the day of her visitation and destruction is at hand. ‘ ‘ Son of man [including the remnant], I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.” (Ezck. 3:17-19) This admonition from Jehovah was directed to Ezekiel who was called the Son of man. With equal, if not stronger, force it is now directed to his remnant on earth who by virtue of being a part of the elect servant take the name “The Son of Man”. One of the titles of Christ Jesus is “The Son of the man” and all of the anointed become part of him. Those at the convention who took away the volume of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> will quickly acquaint themselves with its contents and be ready by the Lord’s grace to do what the Lord requires them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The convention did not adjourn as other conventions have disbanded in the past. Jehovah’s witnesses realized that there is much work now to be done and which must be done quickly; hence the convention merely extended its work by going to other cities or places and there engaged in work. These extension conventions were held July 31 and August 1 and 2 in the following cities, to wit: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same time conventions were held throughout the many countries of earth where the anointed are giving the testimony. Our space here does not permit a full report from these extension conventions; but suffice it to say that the reports show that the enthusiasm which began at Columbus was carried to the other points, and thousands of books were placed in the hands of the people. It was thrilling, to say the least, to see thousands of consecrated people singing praise to Jehovah and marching out of the great auditorium and going to different places to continue the work. Joy was in every heart, and every one was giving thanks to God that he had been permitted to be present at the convention. Those present will carry the enthusiasm to others who were compelled to stay at home; and the good done at Columbus, and the work of witnessing there begun, like waves resulting from the dropping of a great stone in the water, will extend and keep on going out and further out until it fills the whole land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EATING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was necessary for those attending the convention to be fed material food for their physical needs. Many of the Lord’s people have very little of earthly goods with which to supply the necessary food. The Society arranged to serve good food on the grounds at a minumum cost. The Bethel organization took this in hand, and thousands were daily fed. This also enabled many to remain on the grounds and be close to their tents and other sleeping quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> did a splendid service. It is not the purpose of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> to publish the discourses or the discussion of doctrinal points. That remains for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font7"> to do. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> gave a general view of the convention and the work of the Society at its various branch offices in different parts of the earth. Thousands of copies were sent to different parts of the earth, and doubtless the few remaining copies will be quickly absorbed. The treatment of those attending the convention by the good people of Ohio is best expressed by the resolution unanimously adopted on July 30, and which appears as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Be it resolved by Jehovah’s witnesses in international convention assembled at Columbus, Ohio, in July 1931, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That following the Scriptural injunction we delight in all things to give thanks, knowing that whatsoever things our heavenly Father provides for us shall work together for our good because we love him and keep his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We express our sincere thanks to the governor and to the other officers of the State Fair Association of Oliio for the kindness extended to us in providing the free use of the Fair Grounds for our convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank the Chamber of Commerce for its cooperation and many favors shown to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank the radio stations WCAH and WAIU for their cooperation in freely broadcasting the message of the kingdom of God to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank the faithful reporters and the public press for their cooperation and the part performed by them so kindly in publishing and conveying the news concerning our convention to the reading public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We extend our thanks to all the good people of Columbus and vicinity for the many kindnesses shown toward us thus making our stay in this vicinity a pleasant one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord will not forget even the smallest favor bestowed upon his faithful witnesses. We therefore confidently predict that the Lord will show some special favor to the good people of this vicinity who have provided for us even a cup of cold water in his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wo kindly suggest that all such good people turn their hearts more fully to Jehovah, and for you we wish many and lasting blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Columbus convention was unlike any convention ever before held. Comparison seems out of place. It was a monument on the way to the kingdom. It was refreshing and gave strength to the anointed. The Lord provided it and there he fed his people. There he truly proved his promise: “I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.” (Ps. 132:15) All honor and praise is due to Jehovah. Let the anointed continue to honor his name by declaring his works to the people and by singing forth his praises.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark10"></a><a name="bookmark11"></a>UNDERSTANDING PROPHECY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH reveals himself and his purposes to his people in his own due time. His prophecy cannot therefore be understood until it is God’s due time for understanding it. Prior to his due time any interpretation is merely a guess. Without doubt it has been pleasing to the Lord for those consecrated to him to seek an understanding even before the due time to understand. Their very attitude of searching for the truth kept them in harmony with the Lord. The holy angels of heaven sought an understanding; and while the Lord did not reveal his purpose to them, he did not rebuke them, and thus shows that he is not displeased with those who search for the truth. It will be found also that the understanding of the prophecies of God increases as the fulfilment thereof unfolds. Therefore one may see some part of prophecy now, and later see it more clearly. Proverbs, chapter four, verse eighteen, says: ‘‘The path of the just is as the shining light, that shincth more and more unto the perfect day.” It is also true that prophecy has more than one fulfilment. It will be found that at a certain period of time the prophecy has a small or miniature fulfilment, and later a much larger and complete fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many students have made the grievous mistake of thinking that God has inspired men to interpret prophecy. The holy prophets of the Old Testament were inspired by Jehovah to write as his power moved upon them. The writers of the New Testament were clothed with certain power and authority to write as the Lord directed them. However, since the days of the apostles no man on earth has been inspired to write prophecy, nor has any man been inspired to interpret prophecy. The Apostle Peter emphatically says this in his second epistle, chapter one, verse twenty: “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. ’ ’ The interpretation comes from the Lord in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When his due time arrives to bring about the physical facts by which those devoted to him can see that these facts are in fulfilment of prophecy, then the prophecy can be understood. The truth does not belong to any man or any other creature. God’s Word is truth. In his due time he makes it clear to those devoted to him, and not before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To his faithful disciples Jesus said: “When he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: . . . and he will shew you things to come.” (John 16:13) The spirit of God was given to these disciples at Pentecost, and thereafter they spoke or wrote under the supervision of the spirit of God. (Acts 2:4) The Lord did show them things to come, and some of them uttered words of prophecy. There is no Scriptural proof, however, that the apostles had successors, and therefore we must conclude that they had a special mission from the Lord to understand and speak according to his will. Without doubt some of them at least had a better understanding than they were permitted to disclose to others. Paul speaks of himself as receiving a vision from the Lord and of hearing words which it was not lawful for him to utter. That statement of his is found in his second letter to the Corinthians, chapter twelve, verse four. So far as the Bible discloses, there is no other man since the days of the apostles who has had any vision that was not lawful for him to utter. From the words of Jesus we must understand that even his disciples would be permitted to understand God’s purpose only in his due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus also said to his disciples: “And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.” (John 14:29) This is a plain statement of the rule concerning the understanding of prophecy, namely, that ‘when it comes to pass, ye may believe and understand’. The expression “ye” in the text refers to the disciples, and it must be limited to those who are devoted to Jehovah God. This explains why the Lord’s Word cannot be understood by those who are not in harmony with God. If a man wants to understand the Word of the Lord, he must devote himself to the Lord honestly and sincerely. It is clearly stated in Psalm twenty-five, verse fourteen: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostles, under the supervision of the Lord, organized the church in their day. To the members of the church of that time the written epistles or letters of the apostles were directed, but they were intended more particularly for the understanding, aid, and comfort of the members of the church at the end of the world where we now are. The apostle’s own words so state in Romans, chapter fifteen, verse four, and First Corinthians, chapter ten, verse eleven. After the death of the apostles there quickly came upon the church a time of darkness. That was a long period of darkness and is generally mentioned as “the dark ages”. During that long period of time the face of the Lord was turned away from that organization called “the church”, so far as revealing his purposes was concerned. That period of time lasted approximately from the third century to the nineteenth century. In that period there was probably a very small number of the true followers of Christ on earth. The number claiming to be the followers of Christ was large, but those who were faithful and true were few in number. That was the period of time when the true and the false grew together, which condition Jesus described in the parable as the “wheat” and the “tares” growing in the same field. He declared •they must continue thus to grow together until the end of the world. (Matt. 13:24,30,39) The two classes thus growing together, the true followers of Christ were greatly hindered by the false. The teachers in the churches were selfish men interested in political influence and personal flattery. Under the influence and control of the enemy Satan, they caused the truth to become obscure and to be seen very dimly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again attention is called to the words of Jesus, the great Prophet, who with authority from Jehovah said to his disciples: “I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go ... I will come again and receive you unto myself.” It should therefore be expected that the coming again of the Lord would mark the beginning of a better understanding of God’s Word. In harmony with this, it is recorded in the book of the Acts of the apostles, chapter three, verses nineteen to twenty-one, that the Apostle Peter shortly after Pentecost uttered a prophecy, saying: ‘ * Times of ref residing shall come from the presence [or literally, from the face] of the Lord [Jehovah] ; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the heaven must receive [retain] until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” In this the apostle clearly foretells a time of refreshing to the people of the Lord, and that the time would be at the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That would not mean that Jesus must be bodily present again on the earth, because with him distance from the earth is no barrier. He is a spirit creature of the divine nature, and his power is without limitation, regardless of his actual bodily position. Being clothed with all power in heaven and in earth, he could administer the affairs of the church from one point as well as from another. The Apostle Peter’s words just quoted mean that, at a stated time and acting in accord with Jehovah’s orders, Christ Jesus would begin to minister to those consecrated to God and give them refreshing. What would be the nature of that refreshing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter mentions “restitution”, which word would mean a restoring of that which had been taken away or hidden, and would necessarily include the truth that was hidden during the “dark ages”. On another occasion, as recorded in Matthew, chapter seventeen, verse eleven, Jesus said that ‘Elijah must first come and restore all things’. Elijah was a prophet of God who did a restitution work in his time, in that he restored to the Israelites an understanding of the truth concerning God and their covenant relationship with God. (1 Ki. 18: 39) His work was prophetic and foretold that the Lord would restore his truth to his own people. After Elijah was dead, Malachi prophesied that God would send Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Read that prophecy for yourselves in Malachi, chapter four, verses five and six. That prophecy is proof that another should do a work similar to that done by Elijah, but on a far greater scale and of much more importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The restitution or restoring of all things, of which Jesus spoke, and also the restitution mentioned by the Apostle Peter, must begin with the restoring to the people of God the truths that had been hidden during the “dark ages”. That restitution work would progress during the manifestation of the second presence of Jesus Christ. It would be expected that the days of understanding of the prophecies would begin sometime after the manifestation of the Lord’s second presence, and the understanding would continue to increase thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptural proof is that the second presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is invisible and began approximately in the year eighteen hundred and seventyeight (A.D.). In the New Testament Scriptures, which were originally written in Greek, there are three different Greek words used in connection with the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those words arc, to wit: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font7"> (Matt. 24:3) which literally means “presence”; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">epiphancia</span><span class="font7"> (2 Tim. 4:1), which means presence and shining forth with increased light; and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">apokalypsis</span><span class="font7"> (Rev. 1:1), which means the presence of the Lord shining forth with increased light and to a complete uncovering or revelation. Thus is shown the progressive unfolding of the prophecies during the presence of the Lord. That is the period of refreshment mentioned by Peter, and that refreshing is given to, and is for the benefit of, the faithful students of God’s Word, because God has turned his face to them and the Lord Jesus Christ is manifesting his presence and is ministering to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within the period of his presence there is a gradual and progressive restoration or restitution of the fundamental truths of the Word of God. Therefore the work of the Prophet Elijah foretold a period of time for the restoration of all the great fundamental truths of the divine purpose. This prophecy has been fulfilled. Particularly three great fundamental truths were little understood until after the second presence of the Lord. Those truths are, to wit, the philosophy of the ransom sacrifice, the mystery concerning Christ and his body members, and the restitution of the human race during the reign of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That restitution of fundamental truths would not mean an unfolding and understanding of all the prophecies, for the reason that they (the prophecies) had never been understood. It is impossible to restore a thing that did not once exist or that was not once understood. Without a question of doubt the apostles understood the fundamental truths, mentioned above as being restored. It is also equally certain that there are many of the prophecies that they could not clearly understand, because it was not God’s due time to reveal them. One of these truths, in particular, was in reference to the Lord’s second coming, one which Jesus stated no man understood. Jesus said, according to Matthew, chapter twenty-four, verse thirty-six: “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” Therefore the conclusion is that “the restitution of all things”, as referred to by the Apostle Peter, does not have reference to an interpretation of the prophecies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“JEHOVAH HAS SURELY BLESSED”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in extension convention </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">Indianapolis, we desire to express to you our grateful appreciation to Jehovah for the feast of “fat tilings, well </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">refined” </span><span class="font6">provided at the Columbus convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">delight in our new name, and declare our acceptance of it, not by words only, but by zealous activity in the proclamation of the judgments written. The greatly increased vision of the kingdom and our part therein thrills us to the core and fires our enthusiasm and zeal as heretofore unknown. Jehovah has surely blessed his witnesses with an additional outpouring of his spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our joy knows no bounds; as a part of the remnant, “our cup runneth over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now already to the front, we declare our purpose to remain there and sing; singing the glad song of deliverance and of the vindication of the name of our God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We declare our purpose to stay in the unified ranks of the Lord’s army and, by holding the standard of the kingdom high, point the people to the way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please be assured of our love, dear Brother Rutherford. Your own devotion to Jehovah and your fearlessness is an inspiration to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brethren in Zion at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indianapolis Extension Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“SING THE PRAISES OF OUR GOD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be it </span><span class="font6">resolved, that we, a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, assembled in convention at Cleveland, Ohio, do realize the deep significance of the eventful happenings of the past few days </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font6">follows, to wit: The fearless message delivered and timely warning given at the Columbus convention to Satan’s organization and all who sympathize therewith. The clear defining of the new name to be that of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">joyful </span><span class="font6">acceptance of that new name by all the assembled gathering with the full understanding of all its accompanying responsibilities. The clear-cut presentation of the 9th chapter of Ezekiel, showing the work of Jehovah’s organization visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be it further resolved, that we as Jehovah’s witnesses, here assembled at Cleveland, do wish to convey to our dear Brother Rutherford, whom the Lord is so manifestly honoring, and to all who take the new name, our expression of appreciation to the great Jehovah for this, another evidence of his loving-kindness, in the further unfolding of his purposes and that we are determined to lift up the banner of truth and sing the praises of our God until “the battle of the great day” is fought and won and his name vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRED WITH ZEAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Colored brethren of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention at Washington, D. C., in “extension” of the Watch Tower International Convention at Columbus (July 24-30, 1931), believe it to be fitting and proper to express by resolution our gratitude and appreciation, first, to the Lord, and second, to you, for the lightnings brought to us through this convention medium. To Jehovah, because he is the source of light, truth and blessings; and to you as a willing servant used by him for the encouragement, help and comfort to a people that he has named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of us here in convention were eye-witnesses to that vast throng’s acceptance of the name “Jehovah’s witness”, and so far as is known it has met with the unanimous approval of all of the consecrated because it will doubtless eliminate pretenders. The spirit of the convention is here and all are fired with a zeal that will consume. It has added sacredness to our commission, joy in its execution, and boldness in threatening and impending danger, because victory will be to the honor of His name, and He cannot fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the issuance of new literature (The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication), every foot of</span><span class="font6"> earth’s surface becomes new territory and there is work for all. As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font6">the job is secure to the faithful until the work is done and his enemies destroyed—his name vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Jehovah’s witnesses, we pledge ourselves to faithfulness to him and, of course, to his organization visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We, as a </span><span class="font6">company of Jehovah’s witnesses, declare that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">his grace we have come to know that he, Jehovah, is God, the Most High, and that we acknowledge the fact that he is present in the earth for the purpose of establishing his kingdom; that Christ Jesus is the Faithful and True Witness sent forth by Jehovah God as his executive officer; that he is leading Jeho</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">vah's army, </span><span class="font6">the invisible and the visible in which we have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a part; </span><span class="font6">that the purpose of this Kingdom campaign is to vindi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cate </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s name, and to provide an opportunity for proving our integrity, thus making the heart of Jehovah glad and whereby he may give &quot;an answer to him who reproaches”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, we are grateful for the food on the Lord’s table, which he so graciously provides. We are heartily in accord with and gladly adopt the resolutions presented at the Columbus convention, and we take with utmost appreciation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the new </span><span class="font6">name, Jehovah’s witnesses. We are determined in our hearts to follow the King in his work to a triumphant conclusion, and desire to be known as among those registered </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">wholly on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We particularly express our appreciation of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font6">booklet, toward which the Lord has manifested his blessing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the three </span><span class="font6">days that we have had it here at this convention. Also, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">voice our appreciation to the Lord for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font6"> which we anticipate reading with joy and distributing to the people. It was indeed a happy surprise, and we recognize the importance of its title and the message contained therein. Also grateful for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span><span class="font6"> All these loving provisions have greatly refreshed us at this time for the work to be done. We wish to assure you, Brother Rutherford, of our love and hearty cooperation and full support in the stand you have taken, and in which we are privileged to be colaborers as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s </span><span class="font6">witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before we start for the general assembly at Columbus, Ohio, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">two or three in Newport News take this opportunity to express to you our love and thankfulness for the great things Jehovah is giving us at this time present. Particularly do we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">desire </span><span class="font6">to express our loving gratitude to the heavenly Father for the understanding of the book of Esther. This is the ‘ ‘ best </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">yet”; </span><span class="font6">and be assured, dear brother, that we are with you and the rest of &quot;the faithful to the end, by God’s grace. Words </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">entirely inadequate to express the joy and the encouragement which we have received from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> articles on &quot;Esther and Mordecai”. Let all the remnant be brave, be bold, be strong, and the victory is sure and certain. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">victory is the</span><span class="font6"> Lord’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">May the great King of Eternity, Jehovah our God, bless you and strengthen you for the great work you have before </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">you at the </span><span class="font6">convention. The Lord out of Zion bless thee.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PASSED AT THE DETROIT CONVENTION AUGUST </span><span class="font6">2, 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Lord came to his temple for judgment the flashes of lightning have enlightened and are continuing to enlighten our pathway. It has pleased the Lord to use the columns of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and the other publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to refresh, comfort and strengthen his faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We believe that the Society, composed of all the faithful anointed on earth, is the visible part of Jehovah’s organization, and that said organization is proclaiming &quot;this gospel of the kingdom” as foretold by our Lord in Matthew 24:14. We further believe that without participating in said witness work no one can be called Jehovah’s witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of the above facts, be it resolved that we, heretofore known as International Bible Students, assembled in convention at Detroit, Michigan, on this second day of August, 1931, unanimously adopt and confirm the resolution passed at the Columbus convention, to wit: That henceforth we shall be known as Jehovah’s witnesses, a name which we recognize as coming from Jehovah God, as pointed out in the Scriptures, through his great chief executive officer, Christ Jesus our Lord.—Isa. 43: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We rejoice in this greatly, as it further confirms our faith and confidence that Jehovah God is supervising the affairs of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and is guiding Brother Rutherford, its president, in directing the Lord’s work throughout the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be it known, then, to all men that we, as followers of our Lord Jesus Christ, assembled in convention at Detroit, declare our full allegiance to Jehovah God as his witnesses, and that, by his grace, we shall stand shoulder to shoulder with Brother Rutherford and the faithful workers at headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, in sending forth the message of truth to all the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bo it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to Brother Rutherford as an expression of our personal esteem for him and our full confidence in his leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘HAVE HOPED ONE WOULD COME TO MY DOOR’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Mr. Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almost every Sunday morning I listen to you over the radio. Yesterday I listened to you from Columbus, Ohio. Your talk was wonderful. It was just like giving me a cool drink of water after being very thirsty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three or four years ago I bought </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Creation, The Finished Mystery, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell: Who Are There 1 Can They Get Out?</span><span class="font6"> I thought I was just doing a kind act by buying them, and laid them aside. One Sunday morning I just turned the dial on the radio from one station to another, trying to get some church on, and heard you talking. My husband and I listened. The next Sunday I got you again. My husband said you were wonderful, until you talked about the clergy. Two of his oldest brothers are Methodist ministers; and of course he didn’t think you spoke the truth. I did; and that made matters worse. I read all the books I had bought, and asked my husband to do the same. So far I have not succeeded in getting him to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yesterday he listened to you with me (from Columbus, Ohio), and said he thought you must have been sent by God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">do such wonderful work. My husband is a good man; lives </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">clean life; went through the World War, came back without </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">scratch, but won’t have a tiling to do with the church since he came back from France. Why, I do not know; and he won’t say, although he wants our three little girls brought up in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yesterday he asked me to write you for a copy of your talk about The Kingdom. I’ve forgotten the title. I will enclose stamps for the copy. If you please, see that 1 get it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Every day I’ve hoped one of the Watch Tower representatives would come to my door.</span><span class="font6"> I want a lot more of their books. I want to know the truth and to have the truth set me free, as Christ told us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thanking you very kindly, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mbs. Helen</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> M. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">McCann, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JOYFULLY OBEYING GOD’S COMMANDMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the auxiliary convention extension held in Buffalo, N. Y., July 31 to August 2, 1931, comprising three sections of the Lord’s army in this locality, viz., English, Polish and Italian, augmented by several pioneer colporteurs and other workers within a radius of 60 miles or more, the following resolution was presented and unanimously adopted by all of the English, Italian and Polish brethren in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bo it resolved that we in convention assembled in Buffalo, N. Y., be placed on record as whole-heartedly endorsing the resolution of the Columbus convention declaring our allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and proving that allegiance by willingly and joyfully obeying God’s commandment to make known throughout the earth that the kingdom is the only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hope of</span><span class="font6"> the world. We also appreciate that the time has come to deliver a warning from Jehovah to the rulers and to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We also desire to endorse the second resolution, to decline to be called “Bible Students’’ or similar names as a means of identification of our proper position before the Lord. We refuse to be called by the name of any man, and joyfully take the name which the mouth of the Lord 'has named and desire henceforth to be known as Jehovah’s witnesses, entirely separated from all who are indifferent or opposed to Jehovah’s present-hour message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With keenest joy we receive the clear understanding of the relative work of the six men with the slaughter weapons and of “the man with the writer’s inkhorn’’ who goes before them. With amazing clearness we discern our present work to place the mark upon the foreheads of all in “Christendom’’ who sigh and cry for all the abominations that are done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">therefore pledge ourselves, with our Lord’s assistance, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">stand loyally with and in support of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and Brother Rutherford, whom the Lord has chosen and placed in the responsible position as president of the Society and whom we have learned to appreciate and love for his zeal and boldness in the Lord’s service, and in the proclamation of God’s message concerning the kingdom and its complete establishment for the relief and blessing of all who will obey and serve Jehovah and his King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We also appreciate the responsibility placed upon Zion, God’s remnant, today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIGHT IS ON!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in convention assembled at Cincinnati, Ohio, desire to express before Jehovah and his faithful One Jesus, the Amen, and to you, their servant, the unspeakable gratitude and joy we feel at the privileges and favors of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font6">we have partaken at the Columbus convention and do continue to partake at this extension convention here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have en</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tered </span><span class="font6">into the heart of man, the [blessed] things which [Jehovah] hath reserved’’ for his remnant for these days now </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font6">us. Blessed are our ears to hear, and our eyes to see, and our hearts to receive these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With solemn awe and yet with joyful gratitude we receive </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">new name which the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken. The resolution re the new name has been reread here, and the entire convention, both those who affirmed it at Columbus and those who did not have that opportunity, has unanimously adopted the same with enthusiasm. Our sincere desire is to ‘not take the name in vain’ through negligence or slacking </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">hand or failure to measure up to and act upon our privi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">leges; </span><span class="font6">but to walk worthy of this ‘glory which Jehovah now gives to none but his elect servant class on earth’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The surprise gifts, viz., the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font6"> booklet and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font6"> are a delight to our hearts. For these last three days here we have been using the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font6"> booklet in holding forth </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">testimony of Jesus Christ, and the Lord God has greatly aered the efforts put forth. VINDICATION! What a ing name for the latest book! How it sums up the desire of the hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses; and just to think that God has promised: “Delight thyself also in the Lord; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and he </span><span class="font6">shall give thee the desires of thine heart,’’ and that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">while </span><span class="font6">the remnant of his servant are still on earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are resolved to studiously and prayerfully read the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font6"> book, and then, as true and faithful representatives of Jehovah, to march forth shoulder to shoulder with all of his little army on earth and use this book in sounding warning to Christendom and in setting a mark on the foreheads of those that sigh and cry in Christendom and pointing them to the highway over which the ransomed remnant are now privileged to walk under the leadership of God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We await eagerly the appearing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> of the arguments re the new name and the highway, and we appreciate your own part in pointing Jehovah’s witnesses to these hunger-satisfying truths which he has used his beloved Servant Jesus to serve up on the table of the Lord. Your tireless activity and fearless opening of your mouth to give public witness for Jehovah, his name and his kingdom, are a constant stimulus to us and are, to us, an unequivocal refutation of the slanderous charges of the “man of sin” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fight is on! By Jehovah’s grace we are in it with you till the justification of his name and word!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With deep appreciation and love and our prayers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Convention Extension at Cincinnati.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN HEARTY ACCORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The auxiliary convention at St. Louis was a great success; the enthusiasm and joy of those in attendance was remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those not present at the Columbus convention desired to go on record as being in hearty accord with the action taken respecting the new name, and passed the following resolution by a unanimous vote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah’s witnesses in convention assembled at St. Louis, Mo., desire to express their deep appreciation of all the kindnesses bestowed upon them by Jehovah at the present time, and especially in the giving of a new name to the remnant, Jehovah’s witnesses. Also for the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font6"> and the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Hope of the World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“They desire to go on record as being determined to continue to cooperate with all others of the ‘servant’ class under the new name, Jehovah’s witnesses, until Jehovah’s word and name are vindicated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It gives me great joy to convey this action to you and to express my own determination to press the battle to the gate with greater vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Praying the Lord’s continued blessing upon you, and with thanks to Jehovah for the way he has guided you, I am, with Christian greetings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brother by the Lord's favor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J. C. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watt, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chairman of the Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“RAN WITH JOY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I heard your lecture this morning over Station KNX, Hollywood. The room was full, and every head bowed with reverence and straining to catch every word. It was a Methodist home; and after the lecture the man and his wife came over to me and purchased the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font6"> books, also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font6"> The lady said, with tears in her eyes, ‘ ‘ If that is true, why struggle so hard to pay off this mortgage?” I believe they got the full import of your message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I, too, sat listening with tears flowing down my face for very joy, and thought of the scripture, ‘Men will be scorched with fire,’ fervent heat. Surely that was fulfilled today; and I felt as if the angels were singing again to<sup>1</sup> know that God’s name is being vindicated on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How God must love you for your faithfulness to him and to his people! The opposition must feel ashamed after hearing this lecture. I was sorry I could not attend the convention, but glad to have a part in the work here at home. The thermometer has been standing at 112} in the shade for several days the greater part of the day. Yet we ran with joy from door to door, putting out the radio programs for the big hook-up, and glad of the privilege. More power to you, and may God bless you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MANIFESTATIONS OF JEHOVAH’S LOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the last general business meeting of the Peterborough </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ecclesia, </span><span class="font6">a resolution was unanimously adopted that we convey to you our love and our appreciation for the many good things which the Lord is providing for the use of his people through </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">you. </span><span class="font6">So many good things are coming for our use that we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">overwhelmed by the many manifestations of Jehovah’s love and wisdom and of his unlimited power in protecting his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We especially appreciate the articles in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers, </span><span class="font6">particularly the several on the book of Esther, which are a revelation to us all. As the light grows stronger our zeal is increased more and more, so that we want to tell everyone about the Devil and his wicked organization, particularly his frauds and hypocrites, the clergy. It will be a glorious time when the whole system is gone from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Assuring you of our love and our prayers that you may receive strength and guidance as you lead Jehovah’s visible organization on in the battle, we are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brethren by divine grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peterborough (Ont.) Ecclesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SURELY THE LORD IS GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Have read and studied the books </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light;</span><span class="font6"> and I thank my heavenly Father that I am in harmony with every word of them, and wish you to know that I thank him daily that he caused you to write the same for our learning at this time, that we might have our faith increased and press on for the prize. I am fully convinced that tills is of the Lord and not of man. No man unless inspired of the Lord could collect his thoughts and make this book so plain that he who reads may run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely, dear brother, the Lord is good. He satisfies the hungry and gives them their meat m due season, that they may be refreshed with the joy of the Lord, which is their strength at this time to press on and fight the good fight of faith in exalting his name. Sister Pittenger joins me in these thoughts; and believe me, dear brother, you are daily remembered by us at the throne of grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lewis Pittenger, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THANK THE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we know you are very busy regarding the most important work in the world, yet we might make a mistake it we kept silent always. Many times we have felt very much like writing you expressing our appreciation of the work you are doing by the Lord’s grace. We realize fully this work is the Lord’s. We rejoice that the Lord is using you. Your love and devotion to Jehovah God is shown in your defense of his name and word. This should thrill every true Christian. After I think of all you have written and spoken I am thrilled through and through. You have proven beyond any question to have the greatest courage of any in this age in the defense </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">our Creator. Your life and work can hardly help but be of great encouragement to the Christian who thinks at all. I have felt also, in reading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font6"> that you must have a great depth of love for God's children. We cannot deny you have been faithful to them in the expression of his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> is a book we cannot afford to neglect, it speaks for itself. Let the Lord's little ones study it. We need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font6"> books are grand! They are full of thrills. The interpretation of Revelation leaves no doubts m our mind. At last we have the light on Revelation. “Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophet, and observe the things which have been written in it; for the time is near.’’—Rev. 1:3 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">thank the Lord for his goodness, and we express to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">you also </span><span class="font6">our Christian love and best wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yours in the service of the King of kings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W. H. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Farrer, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Calif,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STRONG IN THE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We make no apology for encroaching upon your time. We want you to know our hearts are overflowing with gratitude to Jehovah for placing one at the head of the Society who has the courage to stand before the “great red dragon” and administer thrust after thrust upon him, in the “name of the Lord and of his anointed”. And we want you to know we are with you in this tight, to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We truly appreciate, also, the deep interest you have in the workers in the field. Having received our cards and the letter of instructions, we thanked the Lord in prayer for his loving care thus manifested over his anointed. Our joy knew no bounds at the reading of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font6"> Not since the days of the apostles has anything been written to compare with it. If this does not “fire” the hearts of the friends to their utmost activity, nothing else will. We rejoice to know we have had even a little part in the fulfilment of Revelation thus far, and have no other thought than that ot ‘standing film’ on the side of Jehovah, till all be accomplished. We feel weak in ourselves, but strong in the Lord. And we do love the work, and this wonderful Revelation certainly fires </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font6"> to go on. We are determined to overcome any obstacles the enemy may cast in our way, and, in spite of evil men and evil angels, carry the message of God’s kingdom, or this kingdom gospel, to those who are in darkness and in the shadow of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Praying the Lord’s continued favor and blessing as you watch over the interests of his kingdom, we are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your fellow locusts,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bro. and Sr. J. G. Tope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAISE AND THANKS TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please forgive my taking up your time, but I feel that I’d like to express my appreciation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font6"> Truly the Lord is using you, dear brother; and my desire is to always cooperate with you in serving Jehovah, our Royal Father. Words fail to express the grandeur and the majesty of the truths being revealed at the present time; and it thrills my heart to think that Jehovah should condescend to confide m us this secret. Truly all the glory and praise is due to his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Enclosed please find some verses trying to express what words fail to convey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be assured, dear brother, of my love and continued prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your sister in Zion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Miss) B. Jackson, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">« « « *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah, Creator, the Almighty King, To thee our thanks and our praises we bring; Father! we long to see thy holy name</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cleared and wiped free of each devilish stain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Soon may thy kingdom come, when all shall see That thou alone earth’s great Ruler canst be. Thou art supreme, Father, then all shall know. Praises to thee from all lips then shall flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DETERMINED TO WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How thrilled we are with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light!</span><span class="font6"> We are just bubbling over with joy. Never have we read anything so marvelous. It surely brings joy to our hearts to know we have had, and are still having, a part in carrying the kingdom message to the hungry ones on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have had a glorious time canvassing with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition</span><span class="font6"> this week; and many who hear the Watchtower programs from KROW are rejoicing because the message is being brought to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We feel that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> articles on “The Man of Sin” are meat in due season, forewarning the remnant that we may be prepared for the crucial test. Words fail to express our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to Jehovah for his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And, dear brother, we pray his continued blessings upon you and the dear ones in the Bethel for your faithful stand at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are determined to keep on witnessing the kingdom message until it is done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XIIJ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N. Y., Wednesday, December 23, 1931 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 320</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Wheat as a Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE Chinese claim that Noah was the first ruler of their country and that he introduced the practice of growing wheat. It is known that it was grown by the lake dwellers of Switzerland and by the ancient Egyptians. The grain then was not greatly different from that now. Attempts to germinate samples found wrapped with mu</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font9">mies have not been successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ancient Greek and Roman mythology is full of tales of gods and demigods descending to the earth and teaching men the use of wheat. There appears to be no authentic record that this particular cereal grows wild and sows itself without the help of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No other cereal except rye contains a gluten that is capable of expanding and forming a light porous loaf. Because of its unique composition no other cereal can take the place of wheat for bread-making purposes. Wheat contains more protein and less starch than corn, oats, rye or barley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The wheat kernel is surrounded by a seed pod called the pericarp, a second covering called the episperm, an aleurone layer of nitrogenous matter, the perisperm (or third bran layer), and the endosperm (or floury portion), which constitutes about 80 percent of the wheat kernel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat belongs to the grass family. There are four principal kinds, common wheat, Egyptian wheat, English wheat, and flint wheat, to which the durum and macaroni varieties belong. There is also a dwarf variety. Differing climatic conditions and varying methods of cultivation have produced numerous hard and soft varieties. Drought conditions produce wheat with an unusual percentage of proteins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The wheat plant assimilates its food from the soil at a rapid rate, and the soil must be in a high state of productiveness in order to yield a good crop. Because it is used more extensively as human food than any other cereal it usually commands high prices and is therefore not commonly fed to farm animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At times when it has been cheap and abundant it has been used for feeding live stock and has been found as valuable as other grains for the production of beef, pork, mutton and milk. When fed to animals it is best coarsely ground or pulverized instead of being fed whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Soils, Climates, Varieties, Enemies</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat can be grown on a variety of soils, but thrives best upon rich alluvium and soils formed from different kinds of rock disintegrated and mixed with vegetable mold. The principal wheatgrowing soils of the United States are of glacial formation, composed of clay, silt, fine sand and disintegrated limestone blended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The predominance of Kansas as a wheatgrowing state dates from the arrival of an immigrant girl from Russia who came bearing with her a sack of hard Russian wheat that germinates in cold, arid latitudes. From that sack of seed, carefully selected by her father as her dowry, came the whole empire of Kansas wheat fields of today. That dates away back sixty years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat responds readily to breeding and crossing of standard varieties, but readily reverts to its original condition. Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Montana constitute the main spring wheat region. Winter wheat is grown in states to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Persian wheat) a short-stemmed, heavy-seeded variety, matures in a short season and may be grown successfully in a cold soil. The peasants in the Caucasian highlands follow the receding snow fields in spring, sowing this wheat along their margins as they melt. The yield of this variety is said to be as much as 50 bushels to the acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat yields per acre range from 10 bushels to 30 bushels or more. The yields in the United States are less than would be expected and obtained in countries where land is expensive and intensified farming is practiced.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Ths QOLDEN AQE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Blizzards, cyclones, hailstorms, droughts, heat waves, rust, smut, grasshoppers, Hessian flies, chinch bugs, and something like 100 other kinds of insects give the wheat grower something to think about while he is waiting for his crop to mature. The smuts are destroyed by treating the seed wheat with, chemicals which kill the smut spores, while the rusts are held in check by destroying the host plants, as the barberry, upon which the parasite spends part of the cycle of its life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient and Modem Harvesting</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The ancient Egyptians cut their wheat with a sickle, and their oxen tramped out the grain. In the days of our fathers the wheat was cradled, bound, shocked, and stored in the barn until the threshing machine could get to it. All these operations made work for many men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In more recent years, in the West, the header took the tops off the stalks and left the rest, but the modern combine does the whole harvesting and threshing work at once. A twenty-foot outrigger cuts the tops, which are carried on a moving apron into the threshing plant, where the wheat is separated from the chaff and goes into a bin. When the bin is filled a truck comes alongside and within an hour the wheat is in an elevator or in a box car on the way to market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Wheat Farming Company, Inc., of Hays, Kansas, operates three of these combines attached to one caterpillar tractor. The tractor is sixty horsepower, and each -combine has a twenty-horsepower motor. Every time this outfit goes around the field it performs a. task equal to the work of 1,200 men. Only four men do the work; the other 1,196 are in the army of the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The big wheat farms are getting bigger: the little farms are being swallowed up. Farming is no longer a safe business. No man can leave a farm to his boys and feel that he is leaving them well started in the world. The harvest hand of former days is done for. There is no place for him and there is no work for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat first ripens in the Texas panhandle, and from that time, about the fifteenth of June, the zone advances toward the north at the rate of twenty miles a day. By July 10 it is in Nebraska, and- before August 1 is in the Dakotas. The final harvest is in western Canada. When the wheat is ripe it- must be cut at once: the greater part of the harvest is compressed into five weeks. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The logical thing is that the combines and ttuckers should follow the harvesting from the Texas panhandle to Canada as the farm hands of a generation ago were wont to do, but it - seems not to have reached that stage- yet. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Kansas is specially adapted to wheat growing. The soil is right; the climate is right. There is plenty of machinery and experience in handling it. There does not seem to be any other crop to which the state is as well suited, and the same may be said of much of the land in the states to the north, including the. Canadian Northwest And even if other crops were grown they could but displace in the markets the wheat now grown, on those broad acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Crop of 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Kansas the crop of 1931 surpassed in quality and quantity the best of other years. In no time the barns were full, the country elevators were full, and the central elevators were full and overflowing, and the price went down, down, until in some places the grower was offered less than 25c a bushel. One man who drove into towm with a load of wheat, when offered 24c a bushel for it, opened the tailboard of his truck and drove down the street spilling it after him as., he w'ent, saying he would prefer that- the birds should have it. The raising of the wheat cost him about 50c a bushel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When wheat is $2.25 to $3 a bushel the wheat” country fares well, but it is in distress now. Canada is in worse distress because of a combination of a poor crop with a poor price for it. At the end of the crop year, July 31, Canada had a carry-over of 133,381,633 bushels of wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even if he feeds his wheat to the birds, the grower has to live when times are hard as well as when they are easier, and so it comes about-that many of the wheat growers are in debt, and have to mortgage their growing crops. The elevators keep lists of those who have made such mortgages, and when such a man brings in his wheat he receives in payment a cheek bearing not only his own name but the names of all his mortgagees. Before he can draw any money at the bank he must make settlements with all of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Less Wheat Being Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In fifty years the per capita consumption of ■ wheat flour has declined from 233 pounds to 177 pounds annually. This shift in diet has displaced some 147,300,000 bushels of wheat annually, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">all the advertising in the world will not alter that fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the year 1920 shippers of lettuce sent into the market 12,142 carloads; last year they sent in 55,700 carloads, or more than four and a half times as much. About the same thing has happened in spinach. Ten years ago the market absorbed 2,800 cars; now it handles 10,000. Four times as many carrots are being eaten as ten years ago. All this has cut down the demand for wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perfected refrigeration of fruits and vegetables has also had its effect on the wheat market. During the World War the governments taught the people to eat other foods so that the soldiers could have the wheat. The international conference of eleven wheat-exporting countries, held last May, could only say that there is more wheat than can be sold at a profit, that the depression is world-wide, that markets are uncertain, and that the available statistics are unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the summer the Government sold the Chinese government 450,000 tons of wheat. This amounts to some 15,000,000 bushels, or about one-tenth of the quantity still held by the Farm Board. It is doubtful if this wheat, which will be-used to feed the sufferers from the great Yangtse flood, will ever be paid for, and it does not matter much if it isn’t. It will feed the hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Wheat an Excellent Food &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wheat is an excellent food whether baked into bread or not. It contains all the elements found in the human body. The bran in whole-whcat bread is of particular value, aiding in the prevention of constipation. Everything that money could do has been done to prevent the American people from learning the value of whole-wheat bread, but they are learning it anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the whole country were to be put on rations of whole-wheat bread for a year it might be a good thing for the country. When people have their intestines packed full of plaster of paris their blood does not circulate properly, their brains are not properly nourished and they cease to think. One thing is sure; nobody need starve if he can have access to wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bakers claim that if the farmer gave his wheat for nothing, and if the miller milled the flour for nothing, and the railroads hauled the wheat and the flour for nothing, it would still cost $4.85 to make, bake and sell 100 pounds of bread. They claim that flour constitutes 26.7 percent of the cost of a loaf of bread; other ingredients, 14.5 percent; manufacture, 25.4 percent ; sale, distribution and- administration, 33.4 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The influential </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Berliner Tageblatt</span><span class="font9"> has seriously proposed for Germany a public bread service, so as to assure every citizen the essentials of life which are provided even for a murderer serving a life term in prison. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Tageblatt </span><span class="font9">points out that this bread service would not place any considerable burden on the state and w<sup>?</sup>ould take the wind out of Bolshevism.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Some Whole Wheat Recipes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">The Bethel family of 200 hungry boys uses plenty of whole-wheat bread; the wheat is bought a half a carload at a time, and ground on the premises as needed. To make thirty big loaves requires 50 pounds whole-wheat flour, 15 quarts lukewarm water, pound yeast, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ly<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font9"> pounds crisco, 3 cups salt, and 3 cups sugar. This bread is good; one slice will stay by you half a day, and two or three slices make a satisfying meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Kleinhans Recipe. Two cups of milk brought to scald, three tablespoons sugar, two cups warm water, one tablespoon salt, two tablespoons shortening, one Fleischmann’s yeast cake, five cups whole-wheat flour, three cups white flour, two cups bran. Mix the ingredients into one another one after the other, in the order named. Let rise over night. In the morning put into pans and let rise once. Prick the loaves to release the gas, and bake in a moderate oven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Enright Recipe. Dissolve one compressed yeast cake in a half cup warm water and let it stand until it bubbles, which will take about fifteen minutes. Then add this to one quart of warm water, together with one tablespoon of salt, one tablespoon of sugar, and one tablespoon of shortening, and mix together. Then add two quarts of whole-wheat flour, and mix well. Set this to rise until it has about doubled its bulk, which Avill take from two and a half to three hours. Then punch it down and let it rise again until it has about doubled its bulk. Then put into pans and bake in a medium hot oven for a little more than an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Vance Recipe. My bread is light and delicious. The day before I bake I put a small cup of flour into a crock or pan with a half cup of brown sugar. Mix this well at noon. Strain the potato water into this, mixing it smooth. I use a quart of the water. When cool add one yeast cake. I use Royal, first dissolving the yeast in a little warm water. Set aside to rise. If it is foamy by bedtime put in a cool place. It does not hurt to chill, once the mixture has foamed. In the morning make the dough in the usual way, using whole-wheat flour or half Graham and half v,’hole-wheat. In making the dough put in about a quart of new milk. It does not need to be quite so stiff as with white flour. Set to rise. This takes about one hour, as it does not need to be more than double its size. Make it into loaves when it has risen once. Do not let it rise too long. Have the oven hot for the first half hour and cooler after that. This makes nice bread and gives a delicious nutty taste lacking in the white flour. I do not put salt into the potatoes when boiling, but add to the dry flour before mixing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Weaver Recipe. Three cups graham flour, one tablespoon baking powder, one teaspoon table salt, one teaspoon baking soda stirred thoroughly into one pint of thick milk. Make a stiff batter of the whole and form into biscuits. Bake about twenty-five minutes. There is no yeast in this recipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Boston G lobe Recipe. 2 cups whole-wheat flour, 1 teaspoon soda, % teaspoon salt, 1 cup milk, <sup>:i</sup>-/<sub>2</sub> cup molasses, 1 cup finely ground raw apple with the skin (cut in small pieces and put through a food chopper). Sift soda and salt with flour; add milk, molasses and chopped apple. Bake in a moderate oven.' Serve hot with whipped cream, hard sauce or butter. There are no eggs nor shortening in this recipe. The batter will be soft, but whole-wheat flour absorbs a great deal of moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Rix Recipe. Take 4% pounds of wholewheat flour, 2 ounces of yeast, and a little salt (about 2 teaspoons). Mix the salt and flour and 2 ounces of shortening. Make a hole in the center. Break up 2 ounces of yeast in a little warm water with half a teaspoon of sugar. Let stand until it starts to ferment. Then stir it into the flour. Add 2<sup>:|</sup>J&gt; pints of warm water. Pour that into the center of the flour and mix together with a wooden spoon or mixer until it becomes dough (slightly stiffer than white dough). Knead well for about five minutes, until the dough comes clean off the hands. Grease warm bread tins and place the dough in them, but only half fill the tins. Press the dough well down in the tins and prick with a fork. Warm a clean cloth and lay it over the tins.

Their handsome fronts are designed to suit the style of architecture of the city in which they are located, so that there is great variety. Visitors to the platforms obtain special platform tickets, obtainable from slot machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Freight trains are operated on the same schedules as passenger trains. At transshipment stations the packages are conveyed by conveyer belts or electric trucks. In one of the shunting yards a device sets the switches for all the cars of a train automatically. To work the apparatus, the operator merely manipulates a keyboard, thereby determining the proper way for each of the cars of a train before they start running down. Without any further action on the part of the attendant, each individual car then sets the switches for the one following it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To control the movement of the cars as they come down off the 'cat’s back’, the new shunting stations are provided with braking devices at the foot of the incline which can be operated from a, distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The outward appearance of the roundhouses is that of great factories. Their interiors contain all the accessories necessary for the upkeep of locomotives, and in addition are provided with well-equipped recreation rooms, tubs and shower baths for employees. Trains in Germany are rarely late. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More than 90,000 men are employed to keep in repair the 25,500 locomotives and the 63,000 passenger and 675,000 freight cars. Everything is so standardized that the time for the complete overhauling of a locomotive has been reduced to a few days, thereby materially cutting down the amount of capital invested in locomotives. Statistics are compiled by the punched card system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A photograph of the so-called railway settlement at Nuremberg presents a picture of an exceedingly well built, fine-looking community. An odd feature, to western eyes, is the custom of building the houses not merely on the edge of the sidewalk, but actually over it, so that the children have </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> dry place to play on a rainy day, and Jehovah’s witnesses can go from door to door in wet weather without hats, coats or umbrellas. Probably not all the houses are that way, but some of them are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On German railways, at every moment of its journey the train is controlled by some signal. Besides the main signals mounted on the signal bridges there are caution signals and markers set up ahead of the signals, to notify the engineers that they are approaching the same. On an average, there are four main signals to the mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The management is divided into thirty district administrations. An innovation in the interest of travelers is that between Berlin and Hamburg: on any of the through vestibuled trains the traveler is in telephone communication with any telephone subscriber in either city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the wharves are unbroken rows of cranes of huge size and great carrying capacity. There are specially designed fruit sheds and cotton sheds. Goods in bulk are carried in cars of 60 tons capacity each. The complete unloading of a train of twenty cars can be completed in two and a half minutes. There are almost perfect facilities for the conveyance of practically all types of merchandise. A car of special design carries live fish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The efficiency of the freight service is illustrated by the fact that in a year the claims paid on account of lost, spoiled or damaged consignments, and for failure to deliver within a stipulated time, amounted to only two-tenths of one percent of the total operating cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The dining cars seem to present a more elegant appearance than those on American railways, owing to the fact that the tables for four, instead of being square, are round. Persons who expect to dine on the train may obtain seat cards free of charge, as soon as they board the train. Whenever they are ready to dine the place is ready for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sleeping compartments are small; the beds are single beds. Reservations for sleeping cars can be secured twenty-eight days in advance. The fares are lower than in most other countries, and about half the British fares. Extra fares are charged for extra fast trains. The speed of the fastest train is 55 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Conditions in Arizona </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By a Miner</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font9">UST received one of your booklets, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Oppression: When Will It End?</span><span class="font9"> I have read it through several times, and I have found it to be the truth. I will explain a few things as to the situation in Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is in Gila county. There is a mine operating in this county where wages are extremely high [ ?]. Miners’ wages are $2.50 a day. Hospital fees are deducted from this, which are $2.00 every month, whether a man works twenty days or thirty days. Besides, if he is a single man, he is furnished a small cabin at the rate of $6.00 a month. No bedding is furnished. His bond is $1.50 a day straight. It’s “get in and root” just the same as if he were getting $6.00 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I will give you an idea of the cost of living. In this community some of the miners live in Hayden, ten miles away. They pay $10.00 a month straight, work or no work. All these items are to be deducted from this $2.50 a day. Some of them that have big families rent company houses, this rent also to be deducted from their wages. All right, here is the cost of living: Eggs, 60c to 75c a dozen; potatoes, $4.75 to $5.50 a hundred pounds; sugar, $7.00 to $8.50 a hundred pounds; cream cheese, 60c a pound; flour, soft wheat, 48-pound sack, $1.75 to $2.25; 8-pound can lard, $2.25; butter, 60c a pound; pink beans, 10c a pound, $8.00 a hundred pounds; corn, $2.75 to $3.50 a hundred pounds; Maricopa Milk, large size, two cans for 25c (the Maricopa Milk Company reduced their one-pound cans to 14% ounces, but the price stayed the same); fresh milk, 20c a quart; one-pound loaf of bread, 15c; dried fruit and fresh fruit so high that mediumclass people cannot buy it. Work shoes are $5.00 up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The town is company-owned. They allow so many stores and no more. These are the prices, not only in this county, but also in several other counties; it is either buy here or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font9"> out. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have a state labor commissioner, who sits at his desk at the capital, Phoenix, and draws a big, fat salary. If anyone goes to him about a labor debt, it’s “Can’t do anything for you”. He is controlled by the big mining companies. We have an eight-hour mining law in this state. Big companies are working what they say to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Water Users Association of Salt Lake Valley import a bunch of Mexicans whenever they need men.. The immigrant comes along. “Where is your passport ?” “I have none.” He then comes along, writes out one for the man, and charges him $2.00, knowing that the Mexican has come to this country illegally, and that this company is using imported labor. Big company, “O.K.” Poor, “Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These are only a few of our law enforcer’s doings. I could write you a thousand pages on prohibition, the graft, the different county officers connected with it, the way they handle it; the gambling houses, the way they rob the poor laborer of his money is something awful, in one town in this county especially. (I will give the name on request.) A certain man came to a certain town in Arizona. He worked at the mines for a few months, got to be chief of police, and is still chief of police. The town is owned by a big company. What the company does not own, the chief does. He had nothing twelve years ago; now he is independently rich. He goes undetected in the way he grafts, the way he handles the prostitutes and the gambling houses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Editor Learns a Lot in Two Months ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE July (1931) issue of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Tax Service Journal,</span><span class="font9"> published by the Pittsburgh Equitable Meter Company, contained a real good page-and-a-half story entitled “City of Chanute, Kansas, Tax Free Through Municipal Ownership”. We reproduce the story entire:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chanute is a thriving city of 10,2'77 inhabitants located in southeastern Kansas, on the Neosho river, approximately 120 miles north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, The city lias a commission form of government, consisting of a mayor, a commissioner of finance, and a commissioner of public utilities. It is the duty of the latter- to manage the municipally owned gas, water and electric plants. So successfully have these plants been managed, Chanute’s operating expenses are taken entirely from their revenues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The water plant is located one and a half miles from the city, on the Neosho river, from which the water is forced by electrically operated pumps into an elevated tank in the city, A Westinghouse Positive Fluid Gas Meter measures all fuel gas utilized in this plant. The electric plant, established in 1903, is located in the city adjacent to the Santa Fe Railroad tracks. During the past seven years improvements on this plant totaled $28,214.00, the entire sum being paid for out of the earnings of the plant itself. A Westinghouse Positive Fluid Gas Meter likewise measures gas used in this building. It has been in service for over twenty-five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SURPLUS EARNINGS WIPE OUT TAXES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the same time these improvements were being made, transfers were made to the city’s general fund to take care of a part of the city’s expenses and reduce the tax rate, which has been lowered from 13.81 mills seven years ago to nothing- for the year 1930, The earnings of the gas and electric plants now take care of the entire expense of operating the city. This earning is being made on rates that compare very favorably with the rates charged by other utility companies throughout the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">MUNICIPAL GAS AT LOW RATES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The gas department purchases a part of its gas from local producers, and the balance from three different companies which deliver the gas to the city ’s distribution lines. This gas is purchased, a part of it at 20e and the balance at 25c per thousand cubic feet. The rate to the consumer is 50c for the first ten thousand cubic feet, and is furnished on a graduated scale down to as low as 35c per thousand, making the average cost to the consumer about 42i/&gt;c per thousand cubic feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ELECTRIC RATES ABOUT LOWEST IN STATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The electric lighting rate is 6e for the first 50 k.w.; 5c for the next 50 k.w.; all over 100 k.w. at 4c per k.w.; minimum, charge 50e. The power rate starts at 3i/&gt;c and graduates down to If-tc per k.w.; minimum charge 50c per connected h.p. The city officials believe their rate is the lowest in the state, taking into account the free service rendered the city. Street lighting, whiteway lighting, parks and Memorial Building, and in fact all city lighting, is done without any charge whatever, and no credit is given the Electric department. In addition to this, the Memorial Building, which contains about 33,000 square feet of radiation, is furnished with free steam from the electric plant. The free service rendered the city, if paid for at the prevailing rates charged by the utility companies throughout the state, would amount to $20,000.00 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Imagine our surprise at. seeing in the September issue of the same journal an elaborate three-and-one-half-page article attacking municipal ownership, and particularly the good defense of it which had appeared in their own periodical in July., An editor can learn a lot in two months, when his job depends on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The arguments in the September issue are the old stock arguments, that New York city’s sewers should be in the hands of a private corporation and that Uncle Sam ought to have his postal business conducted for him by somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bookkeeping of the municipal plant is questioned. Of course, nobody would think of questioning the bookkeeping of the public utility companies. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font9"> know in advance that it would be so crooked it would make the railroad up Mount Tamalpais look like an air line by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whole object of the September article is to prove to us once more that in the judgment of Big Business they have not a man in their crowd that can be trusted to do the right thing by the public if put in a position of trust. The argument is that in other countries men in public office can be trusted, but not in America. They know that they themselves cannot be trusted and. they think that nobody can be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a poor argument, but the editor had to 'do something to keep his job. It would be interesting to knoAv what the Big Boss said to the editor after the July issue appeared telling all the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Tax Service Journal’s</span><span class="font9"> readers the truth about what a few honest men are doing at Chanute. No wonder he winds up his September article by saying;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font10"> in Barber Shops </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By 8. SaltonstaU (Michigan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font9">BOUT every three weeks I get a haircut (I shave myself), with one “Dan the Barber”. For the last year I have been making Dan a present of a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As you know, in days gone by a real barber could no more run a barber shop without a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Police Gazette</span><span class="font9"> than a young married couple could keep house without a picture of a fish in the dining room.

<p><span class="font10">Why I Am a Chiropractor </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. B. M. Cool (Ind.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C</span><span class="font9">HIROPRACTORS view the spine as a delicate structure, whose parts are subject to derangement which causes dis-ease. Chiropractic comprises a system whose use specifically locates causative derangements and adjusts them to proper articular arrangement to restore health. This system is largely the result of the labors of B. J. Palmer, I). C., Ph. C., son of the founder of the science,/ Thousands who have been relieved of afflictions testify to their recovery at the hands of chiropractors. It has won, against mighty odds, solely on its merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Chiropractic?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The chiropractic idea, briefly stated, is this: The cause of dis-ease is in the person afflicted. Adjustments correct conditions that produce it. The function of every organ in the body is controlled by the brain, through mental impulses, which are transmitted over nerves. Any impingement, or pinching of the delicate nerve fibers, interfering with free flow of nature’s life-giving force, results in impaired or abnormal function. This is dis-ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This interference is produced by vertebrae which are out of their normal position (subluxated), pressing upon nerves where they pass out from the spinal cord to vitalize various organs of the body. The trained adjuster (expert in his knowledge of the spine) locates the exact points of interference, and, by adjusting the subluxated vertebrae, removes the cause. Normal condition, health, is the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Spinal Column</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The spinal column is the main shaft of the body. It supports the head, trunk and extremities, and to its marvelous structure is due man’s upright position. The spine is composed of thirty-three segments, and twenty-four of these are freely movable in the normal adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From childhood to old age the human spine is subjected to terrific strain. Its construction and our manner of walking upright subject the column to every manner of concussion. It carries the heavy load of the trunk. It suffers the effects of constant jarring. Violence and straining jar and jolt it; contraction of muscles tends to exert abnormal pressure. Forces are concentrated on some segments and draw them out of alignment. Nerves are impinged just the moment a vertebra is thrown out of its normal position. Then the flow of the life-supplying current is impaired. There can be but one result in the organ supplied by the pinched nerve, and that is dis-ease, not at ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Spinal Anatomy</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The spinal cord leaves the brain at the base of the skull and enters the spinal column. As the spinal cord descends it gives off thirty-one pairs of nerves. Each nerve trunk, as it passes through its allotted opening, completely fills it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After clearing the spinal column, each nerve branches and spreads to such an extent that the combined ramifications of the thirty-one pairs of nerves reach every cell in the body. It is by this wonderful system of nerves that the mind is enabled to control and govern the function and action of every organ and tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When this complete control exists, we are in a state of health. It is often the case, however, that the vertebrae are subluxated. This subluxation causes the spinal opening to become much smaller than it should naturally be and, in consequence, the nerve which passes through the opening is impinged by the bones. It can readily be seen that a nerve affected in this way cannot transmit nerve impulses as well as a nerve that is free from pressure. If this nerve supplies a muscle, that muscle becomes paralyzed; if it supplies the stomach, some form of stomach trouble will result. Disease of any organ of the body follows the impairment of the flow of vital force over the nerves supplying that organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Chiropractor</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A chiropractor is a person who, after being duly educated in the science of chiropractic and trained in the proper application of the art, uses his bare hands in contact with the various processes of the vertebrae to effect a peculiar adjusting move to realign the subluxated units and release nerve compression. Such adjustments are harmless and leave no ill effects with the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With fingers trained to a high degree of sensitiveness by many months of constant practice, the chiropractor palpates the spine and locates the vertebrae which are out of position. Sensitive nerves are traced from the spine to affected organs of the body, and in this manner the truth of deductions is proved beyond shadow of a doubt. The adjustic move is given with a sudden thrust and no injury to the patient. So certain is its effect that 95 percent of cases obtain results from chiropractic adjustments. This may take days, weeks or months, depending upon the condition of the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chiropractors properly qualified for graduation have had a course of study and training of 4,1031 class hours, as contained in three collegiate years covering a calendar period of eighteen months. These class hours indicate the effort the chiropractor must make to educate himself in a subject which is far more simple than medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Why Adjust?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is difficult for those who do not understand the basic principle underlying chiropractic to comprehend why the spine should be adjusted for disorders whose symptoms appear in remote parts, such as the foot, leg, or in the head, arm or shoulder. This is readily understood when it is remembered that nerves innervating all organs and tissues of the body are branches from the spinal cord. They are all subject to nerve compression, due to subluxation of the vertebr®.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Impingement of any nerve by a partial closing of these openings gives rise to ailments in the parts to which the nerves lead, no matter in what region of the body the nerves terminate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">How Chiropractic Acts</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chiropractic is in perfect harmony with the inherent forces of the body. The human organism possesses or is endowed with a marvelous vital force which functionates through impulses constantly received from the brain. Awake or asleep, conscious or unconscious, man knows that his intricate machine is kept running by some mental force, intangible, beyond his ken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chiropractic confesses that it does not know what constitutes this vital force of the bodjn But the chiropractor knows that it is an undeniable fact, demonstrated by actual experience on living subjects, through a long term of years, that he is able, through adjustments, to inhibit or accelerate its action. No other health system is so specific. Acting as it does in.perfect harmony rvith natural forces, it cannot be productive of anything but good under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Health?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The human body consists of a great number of different parts, and each part has its own special work to do. Each organ not only does its own work, but acts in harmony with other organs. This relationship between the organs permits them to be grouped together into what are called systems. Thus we have the circulatory system; that is, the group of organs (heart, arteries, veins and capillaries) concerned in the circulation of the blood; the digestive system ; the nervous system, and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each of these systems, composed of more or less different matter, must receive from the nerves mental impulse to enable it to perform its appointed task; otherwise, it lags behind; it is unable to maintain its place in the systematic well-being. In such case there is no longer unity between the relative systems. The harmonious cooperation of the body is destroyed and health is no longer present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By health, therefore, Ave mean perfect coordination between several systems, from which ensues a condition determined by an imperceptible performance of normal function throughout the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brain is the powerful dynamo. Each organ is a motor. There must be uninterrupted flow of current (vital energy) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">between the</span><span class="font9"> two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Dis-ease?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just as it is necessary to have a clear conception of what is meant by health, so it is well to understand what is implied by disease. Much time and thought has been devoted to the clas-silication of dis-ease, which, to the mind of the chiropractor, had been better spent in seeking and rectifying primary causes. Dis-ease is simply a condition. We speak of “'catching cold”. We never “catch” or •'•'take” anything. Dis-ease is a “minus”, not a &quot;'plus” quantity, and when any organ or system is infected it is due to a minus or excess of function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So long as the various systems of the body are in perfect harmony, one with the others, no harm comes of the invasion of these minute hostile germs; but should the lungs, for instance, become devitalized through excess or lack of nerve force, then the invaders find a lodgment in the lung tissue and dis-ease manifests itself. Unless a sufficient reserve force can be called upon, the invaders assume control with greater or less rapidity, and death ensues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To prevent dis-ease all the nerves of your body, both motor and sensory, must be kept in perfect condition, so that vital force’ may be transmitted normally. Interruption of the flow of vitalizing energy between the brain and</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>QOLDEN AQE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">tissues, over the nerves, means disorder, incoordination, dis-ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How Adjustments Are Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In taking a chiropractic adjustment the patient lies on an adjusting table. Preparations for an adjustment require very little change of the clothing. No immodest ordeal is encountered, and no portion of the body is presented to view except the restricted area immediately over the spinal column.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Brain and Nerves</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">The human brain is the generator of nerve energy. Nerve impulses are the life of the body. Health will prevail only in degree as mental impulses can be transmitted from the brain over the nerve filaments. These are transmitted through the spinal cord, thence by way of nerve trunks that find their exit through the several openings between the vertebra. From these trunks filaments radiate to every part of the body. When the spinal column is in normal alignment, the brain generates and transmits over nerves 100 percent of vital force. Health is the natural result. Should one or more of vertebral units be out of alignment, the deviation diminishes the size of the openings between them, causing their bony substance to compress the tender nerves. This pressure interferes with nerve action and produces the condition called dis-ease, no matter in what part of the body the symptoms are manifested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For instance, if the kidneys are affected by too much or too little mental impulse, their excretory function is disordered and poisons that should naturally be voided, from the body remain to permeate tissues foreign to it and seriously affect health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under chiropractic adjustments the kidneys are restored to normal. Poisons are eliminated from the system. Coordination is restored throughout the entire system. Nature is given free reign to give man his heritage, health.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Chiropractic and Women</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Every man, 'woman and child has a backbone. Chiropractic is effective in elimination of disorders in sufferers of all ages and both sexes. Women, above all, are most often victims of illness and functional incoordination. Chiropractic has proved itself a boon to womanhood: girls, wives, mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Headaches, in a large majority of cases, are speedily and often permanently removed by spinal adjustments. Relief, in many instances, is immediate. So-called nervous headaches, especially in women, are merely the effects of several disorders that may exist in organs remote from the head. Adjustments prove of effective value as rejuvenator of functions depleted by derangement, by the removal of causative subluxations and the restoration of inactive nerves to full vitality. Thousands of women who have failed to obtain relief after months, maybe years, of suffering, have been made well through chiropractic adjustments.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Postpones Operations</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">To women especially, with their highly nervous and complex organisms, chiropractic offers a sane, harmless, and effective means of restoring functions, be they subnormal or hypersensitive. Unsexing of women by the use of the knife upon the slightest pretext is so entirely unjustifiable that its perpetration is of itself a proof of the futility of pharmacotherapy (meaning treatment with medicine). The operator by operating, or even suggesting an operation, is merely saying that pharmacotherapy (treatment with medicine) is useless; therefore saying that an operation is the only thing. Under no circumstance should an operation be permitted until chiropractic has been tried. Remember, no power of man can restore a dismembered organ.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Cause of Dis-ease</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Chiropractors know that dis-ease is due to impingement of nerves by the bones of the spine. Proof of this assumption is the fact that when the vertebra are adjusted to their normal apposition patients recover from their ailments. There is much unquestionable evidence to prove this assertion. That the chiropractic idea is right is absolutely demonstrated by actual practice. Let us talk for a minute about the abnormal function in the nose which the M.D.’s call 'hay fever’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you read the article on the so-called “hay fever” in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span><span class="font9"> of July 5, 1922, or the July (1922) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font9"> you will find the author says hay fever is caused by the pollen from trees, weeds and grasses, by dandruff from cats, dogs and horses, by goose feathers, bacteria, etc., and that it can be cured by an injection of serum made from that which is causing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus, for instance, if the doctor decides that your hay fever is being caused by the pollen from ragweeds he will make a ragweed pollen soup or serum, inject this serum underneath the skin of your body in increasing quantities three times a week for five or six weeks before you are due for your annual attack of hayfever. This treatment varies somewhat according to what they think is causing the hay fever. If it be cat dandruff, you get cat dandruff soup injections; dog dandruff will call for dog dandruff soup; horse dandruff, for horse dandruff soup; goose feathers, for goose feather soup, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If this theory of the cause and cure of the so-called “hay fever’' be correct, chiropractic is absolutely wrong, because we chiropractors ignore the pollen, dandruff, goose feathers, etc., as completely as the other professions ignore the &quot;power within” that built the nose and keeps it functioning normally as long as the nerves over which it sends its functional impulses are unimpaired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The difference between the two explanations of the cause of the so-called &quot;hay fever”, and of what must be done to get the patient well, cannot be reconciled. If one is right the other is wrong. One side says the cause of hay fever is outside the body, and the other side says the cause is inside the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chiropractic teaches that there are pollen, dandruff, goose feathers, bacteria, etc., enough in the ■world, to give everybody an everlasting dose of hay fever if these were really the cause; but the fact that but one person in a hundred has hay fever proves to us that the difference is not because one person’s nose gets all the pollen or dandruff, but because that person’s nose is not working normally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Venders of serums, and those members of health professions who find it easier to accept fallacies than to ascertain facts, state very dogmatically that “disease is caused by living germs”. However, there are others, in every profession, who are more interested in ascertaining facts than in selling serums and vaccines, and of these gentlemen perhaps Richard Cabot, M.D., of the Massachusetts General Hospital may be regarded as the spokesman. And for fear you will not remember the words spoken by Dr. Richard Cabot, I will at this time repeat: In a book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A Layman’s Handbook of Medicine,</span><span class="font9"> pages’ 85 and 86, he states the position of the thinking members of his profession as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The mere presence of bacteria means nothing and does not constitute disease. Disease is the presence of these bacteria plus a lack of resistance to them. For example, &quot;we have, all of us, all the time, bacteria in the deeper layers of our skin. We cannot wash them off: they are too deep in. But when our vitality is reduced, they produce a pimple or some other disease in the skin. There are bacteria passing through the kidneys all the time. If anything reduces our general health, they take root and produce trouble there. The presence of bacteria in itself never causes disease. So far as we know, they are necessary elements in the process of digestion. They live with us, not on us, and help us to live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now if this statement made by Dr. Cabot be correct, the germs are always with us and their activity depends on a “lack of resistance”. Now if we ascertain the cause of the “lack of resistance” we have found the cause of dis-ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a little booklet published by the Metropolitan Insurance Company, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">War Against Consumption,</span><span class="font9"> the opening sentence is: “'Consumption is caused by living germs.” In the next paragraph the author says</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">: “A</span><span class="font9"> strong healthy person will resist the germs, but a person who is weak will not ordinarily withstand them.” Just to prove that there are enough germs to give every one consumption, if germs really caused it, the author says farther along in the article: “Nearly everybody at some time swallows or breathes in the germ of consumption, but owing to the power of resistance of the healthy body the germs are not able to multiply.” And then to show his consistency he says: “The only cure for tuberculosis is to increase the bodily strength, so that the body will resist and gradually destroy the germs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If either of these statements is true, the other cannot be. Other professions insist that the first statement is true, that “consumption is caused by germs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We chiropractors insist that the last statement is true, to the effect that a healthy body “resists” the germs. Now let us see: If a body is unhealthy it is not normal. If any part of the body is unhealthy it is sick, for sickness is but an abnormality. The author of the “Consumption” pamphlet says that germs cannot affect a healthy pair of lungs, that they affect only lungs that are unhealthy (diseased).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If this be true the lungs must be diseased before the germ can live, for healthy lungs, strong lungs, lungs that are normal, destroy the germ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now the question arises, Are the lungs diseased because the germs are there, or are the germs there because the lungs are diseased? The germ theorist says the lungs are diseased because the germs are there, and we take the flatly contradictory position that the germs are there because the lungs are dis-eased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We say that every drop of water, every breath of air, and every morsel of food is teeming with germinal life, so that if germs caused dis-ease the human race would long ago have perished from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We say germs are scavengers and live on dead tissue, just like turkey buzzards, catfish, hyenas, or any other kind of scavengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We explain the germs’ being present in the dis-eased lungs by the fact that they live on dead tissue, and the tissue in the lungs is dead because the life force or functional impulse by which the nerve force keeps the lungs in repair is shut off by a vertebra in the spine being subluxated and pressing on the nerve, thereby preventing the normal supply of functional impulses from reaching the lungs, and this is the cause of the lack of resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If this be correct, all that is necessary to restore a normal supply of functional impulses to the lungs is by adjusting the vertebra to normal alignment with the hands. This is all the real chiropractor does, and when this is accomplished the nerve force that built the lungs and keeps them in repair will bring the lungs to normal and the germs will die for lack of food. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We might go on endlessly with these contrasts of the difference between chiropractic and other methods, but a thousand examples would make the difference no more apparent. Our position can be stated briefly: It is simply that dis-ease is not something from the outside that somehow gets inside, but something from the inside (meaning functional impulse) that doesn’t get outside, because the channel over which this something travels (the nerves) is obstructed.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>About Skepticism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">While one man is saying “it can’t be done”, someone else is doing it. Folks are skeptical of things they do not understand, never taking the trouble to study them. Revolutionary inventions have been scouted as impractical. Every new discovery has its hosts of doubters. Without the expenditure of an hour’s study, even a moment’s thought, the unthinking boldly proclaim every new idea an impossibility because, perchance, simple as it may be, it is unintelligible to them. The new is condemned, if for no other reason than its newness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not apart from the usual order of things, therefore, that a radical departure from oldtime physiological dogma, as is chiropractic, should be maligned by bigoted medical practitioners and unenlightened laity. They forget that these are days of change, when scientific changes are effected over night. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Skeptics ask what possible assistance can be given disordered kidneys, liver, stomach or heart by chiropractic spinal adjustments? Pulling the trigger of a gun is remarkably easy. Without a knowledge of the latent force within the cartridge, its effects upon any living thing within the line of fire might appear incredible. But to those who can reason from cause to effect, the consequences are clearly defined. So it is with chiropractic adjustment. It immediately releases the latent force which is an inherent part of all living organisms, stirring dormant matter to life and action. And its value in the restoration of conditions wherein normal functioning of the various organs may be resumed is testified to by thousands of chronic invalids who have regained health through its application.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Some Conclusions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">The reader will have concluded that chiropractic, in its theory and practice, is unlike any other known health system. There is, in fact, no administering of remedies or any therapeutical or surgical procedure, as in the practice of medicine; there is no massage, manipulation, nor any belief in the principles of fluid circulation, of osteopathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no relation between the theory and practice of chiropractic and that of “suggestive therapeutics”, the occultism of “theosophy”, or the mysticism of the so-called “Christian science”. All that the art of chiropractic is, ever has been or ever can be, is widely different from anything known or used prior to or since its foundation from the principles of the chiropractic science, save only as its constituents have been taken from it and appropriated by and used in the practice of other health forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ After all the good things I have mentioned to the reader in order that the reader may see and decide for himself the difference between the right and the wrong way in securing ease (health), will say: As far as my profession is concerned, I am happy, for I well know that when I give a chiropractic adjustment I am not putting any poison in the system. I often have the question put to me like this: If chiropractic is so good and will do such wonders, why was it not discovered hundreds of years ago? I answer by asking, Why did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob not know enough to place a little box on the wall with battery and wires attached and talk to each other in their time ? They had more brain cells working then than even the best of us today. The reason is that it was not God's due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But won’t we all be glad when the great Physician takes full charge? Then I, for one, will be only too glad to take down my sign and turn it all over to Him. Tie says: “Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jer. 33:6) “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”—Isa. 33: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When will this take place? In His government (kingdom) for which we have been praying, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No Fish Can Live at Bauxite </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Helen Von FiclWhenthal (Arkansas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font9">RKANSAS is a great producer of aluminum-bearing ore. We have at Bauxite a lake created by excavating this ore. It has been stocked with fish, time and again, but they all die, and so does any other living thing that tries to make this aluminum-impregnated water its home; and it has affected such streams of water as take care of its overflow..</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aluminum poison, like all other poisons, does not affect everyone alike; as the constitution and general habits (the resistance reserve) of each person govern this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But it gets its victims, sooner or later, as all poisons do. It got our friend McCann.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The difference between aluminum that is a part with other materials in cooking vessels and solid aluminum cooking vessels is that by this mixture it is neutralized, and is like taking a drop of poison in a bucket of water, instead of the full strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Living as you do and as our friend McCann did and Dr. Tilden does, keeping the avenues of elimination, bowels, etc., constantly open, has kept you, and them, from feeling the instant effects of aluminum poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Any vessel that will put on a leaden sediment when some articles of food are cooked in it, and get shiny bright with others, must be giving off an amount of chemicals to do this, and that, in itself, should be a warning, for wo want no ingredients in our food except those we intend to put there. Also, whenever pots put on discolorations, that means that some day some food ■will get into that pot which will, combined 'with the pot’s chemicals, create a very undesirable mixture, and tragic results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aluminum has enough legitimate worthy places to fill, in airplanes, autos, railroad cars, furniture, etc., without training, the people to believe it is fit for cooking vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As to chips from other classes of vessels, they are so rare, for one, that they do not deserve mention, except as an advertisement to boost-other ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I was raised on a farm, and was called the nurse in the family. Every animal sick beyond hope was turned over to me, and patience and time always brought results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have had small turkeys and chickens in my care which had swallowed steel needles. The first intimation of this was seeing it stick out, having penetrated everything that was in its way. The needles were extracted gently and the fowls got well. Evidently internal punctures of intestines were taken care of by nature’s methods. That does not say that we should eat needles, or pot chips, but it does prove that a little chip, so little that it is not noticed when masticated or swallowed, has little chance to do harm, and will be well guided out of the system in the pasty contents of the intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Prevention of Simple Goiter </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By the United States Public Health Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[The only reason we are printing this is that we want all our readers to see that this whole thing is merely medical propaganda. What can anybody get out of this so-called “health” article except the idea that the only safe thing is to see your doctor, and yet the article contains the evidence that the doctor himself would not know what to do. It is perfectly apparent that under the guise of public health hints the people are paying the bills of medical propagandists ~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which ought by right to be paid by themselves.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE ease and simplicity with which goiter prophylaxis is accomplished has nearly been the undoing of this very valuable procedure, according to a recent statement by the United States Public Health Service. Many persons with goiter, attracted by the apparent ease with which the malady may be prevented, have concluded that what is useful for prophylaxis of the simple form is likewise efficient as a means of treating all types of the disease. Much harm, has been done by this erroneous assumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is necessary, therefore, to caution people that there are certain goiters which are made worse by the ingestion of iodine. Moreover, the measures that may be effective in preventing simple goiter are in no wise useful in forestalling other and more severe forms of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following questions quite naturally arise regarding simple goiter: First, why should simple goiter be prevented? Second, is the condition more than a deformity of the neck? These reasonable questions may be answered by citing the experiences of certain foreign countries in which the disease prevails unduly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When unchecked, simple goiter is often associated with mental and physical degenerations, especially deaf-mutism, feeble-mindedness, and the idiocy of cretinism. The ill effects of uncontrolled goiter are particularly severe in subsequent generations. Fortunately, the affection has not reached this degree of intensity in the United States, nor is it likely that it will reach it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The causes of simple enlargement of the thyroid gland may be conveniently classed as immediate and remote. The immediate cause of this condition is now believed to be a complete absence or marked deficiency of the iodine necessary for the normal functioning of the gland. Anything which interferes with the intake or utilization of iodine available in normal quantities may likewise cause enlargement of the organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus, infections, intoxications, faulty diets, and such periods of stress in female life as puberty, pregnancy, or the change of life, may be mentioned as remote or underlying causes of simple goiter. It is a matter of common knowledge that females are more prone to s</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font9">ple goiter than are males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The most satisfactory method of administering iodine for the prevention of simple goiter is by adapting the remedy to each person in need of it. In this way accurate dosage and nominal supervision is insured. Obviously this method is costly and cumbersome, reaching only a small portion of those requiring the protection. In order to overcome these objections, wholesale prophylaxis by the use of iodized table salt and iodized water supplies has been suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While both of these methods are theoretically sound, it is not yet definitely known whether they are effective and, at the same time, incapable of causing harm to persons with existing goitrous enlargements. Therefore, the individual method is preferable at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is likely that the regular consumption of foods naturally rich in iodine will aid in preventing goiter. It is known, for instance, that marine algae, deep sea fish, and crustaceans are particularly rich in iodine. But here again the uncertainty of dosage and economic factors are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Variations in the iodine content of food and Avater probably account, to a considerable extent, for the differences in goiter incidence in the United States. Until more definite knowledge becomes available concerning the value of iodized salt, iodized water, and iodized foods, it appears best to individualize in goiter prophylaxis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Goiter prophylaxis is most telling in its effects among children between the ages of 11 and 17, especially among girls. Even more important, as has been pointed out, is the institution of appropriate prophylaxis before a person is born. Under the supervision of a skilled physician a prospective mother may receive protection not only for her own thyroid but also for the gland of the expected child. Any plan, therefore, that safeguards the thyroid gland during fetal life, adolescence, and pregnancy may confidently be expected to aid in eliminating simple goiter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been aptly said: “Simple goiter is the easiest of all known diseases to prevent/’ Where, then, maj<sup>7</sup> one turn for explicit advice? Either the family physician or the local health officer is well qualified to suggest the most effective means of preventing this rather widespread affection. Self-drugging with iodine is dangerous and should be shunned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why I Do Not Buy Red Cross Seals </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Lora C. W. Little (Illinois)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font9">Y REASONS for refusing to buy the “Red Cross Seals”, sold every year before the holidays, are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First: The proceeds are used for no definite and specified purpose, but appear to be at the disposal of medical health officials for whatever they like, all of which uses, so far as discovered, I consider highly injurious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have a record where the money was used to give children smallpox vaccine. Another where it was used to Schick-test and inject toxin-antitoxin. This operation has sickened, crippled and killed many children: the number unknown because the health officials cover their tracks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Second: The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Northwestern Health Journal, </span><span class="font9">organ of the Minnesota Public Health Association, carries a notice that it is supported by Red Cross Seals. The association named is controlled by and for American Medical Association doctors for purposes of medical propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Third: During the World War, the Red Cross set aside a considerable sum of the money that had been contributed for army relief to set up a laboratory for animal experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the time of the Mississippi floods, and again when the floods occurred in New England, the Red Cross refused relief until the starving, shelterless victims submitted to vaccination and typhoid inoculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fourth: When the Seal proceeds are used for “tuberculosis work”, the latter is all directed by allopathic doctors and involves much injury and cruelty. In the first place, “forcible hospitalization” is resorted to, and in the second, shots from the poison needle, experimental “serums”, are forced on patients, especially on the little helpless children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">INVESTIGATION of the death of Wesley</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lowery, 26, Frisco fireman, who died at his home, 1235 Tutwiler Avenue, at 12:45 a.m. today after being given an injection of malaria anti-toxin, was dropped by police today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lowery, apparently in the best of health, received the malaria, injection at 8 p.m. Tuesday, and a short time later his relatives received a call from the physician, saying that he was dying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Friends took Lowery to his home, where another physician was called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. James H. Collins, with offices in the Lnion &amp;&nbsp;Planters Bank Building, the second physician summoned, today said that Lowery’s reactions were not typical of a quinine poisoning case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“He was unable to talk to me, and was very nervous. All he could tell me was that he had taken a ‘shot of ether’,” Dr. Collins said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Capt. Frank Glisson, of the police homicide bureau, today said that he would make no further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“His death is not a police matter. He wms under the care of a doctor at the time of his death,” Glisson said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lowrey’s mother, Mrs. B. G. Fesler, 1235 Tutwiler, was prostrated Wednesday, as was his sister, Mrs. James Olinger of the same address. They were under medical care and were not allowed to see anyone but relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. S. L. Wadley, city health officer, said that while typhoid preventives could prove fatal, it was unusual for them to have such a reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. II. B. Everett, president of the Shelby Medical Association, said Wednesday that he would look into the facts in the case, and confer with Dr. L. M. Graves, city health head, concerning an investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“If necessary I will appoint a committee at once to investigate the case,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. S. L. Wadley of the city health department said that a report on a death must be made within three days after death occurs. The cause of death must be given on the death certificate, Dr. Wadley said.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE Rockefeller Foundation has offered to donate to the Japanese Government about 4,-000,000 yen for the betterment of Japanese hygiene. After studying the offer it was decided to establish seven schools to train specialists to become standard officials in public hygiene, 50 specialists and 50 to 100 temporary students in each school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chinese boycott of Japanese goods is so effective at present that the sale of Japanese goods in China is only 20 percent to 30 percent that of other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In pre-war times Russia had 200 small factories, with only 65,000,000 roubles worth of products annually. In 1926 the products surpassed those of pre-war time, and in the year 1930 rose to 406,500,000 roubles. It is anticipated that the production for this year will be more than double that of last year. The area'of Russian cotton fields this year, 2,390,000 hectares, is 50 percent greater than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The poverty of Koreans may be judged from the fact that to pay a tax of 8 sen, or a little less than 4 cents, officials took from a poor man his only valuables, consisting of two pans in which he cooked his food. When he protested that he needed the pans to live, he was told that nobody asked Koreans to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">About 700,000 packages of Russian silk thread have appeared in New York, where, as they were inferior to the Japanese articles, they were sold for about 20 percent less than the price for Japanese goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the flood waters at Hankow higher than for hundreds of years, multitudes of the Chinese people cursed the Government, accusing it of having made the water god angry by pulling down the temple of king dragon and building a road through it. Thereupon two officials built an altar on the spot where the temple had stood, and offered a prayer to the dragon for relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Despite this prayer, rain continued to fall and hundreds of thousands lost their homes and their lives. In one instance a man used a coffin as a lifeboat. This is possible in China for the reason that some of the Chinese do not bury their dead, but pile them up near temples or on open fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The floods continued to rise until an area of arable land equal to the whole area of Japan proper was overflowed. There are 4,000,000 families within the circle of the calamity. While the flood was at its height there was a big fire in Hankow and hundreds of buildings were reduced to ashes. About.the same time also a gun-pow’der magazine blew up and many people were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After twenty months traveling in Russia, Europe and America, the secretary of a Korean daily, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Dong-A-llbo,</span><span class="font9"> has returned, saying that all the capitalist nations are in a great confusion which cannot be corrected, and are in great agony. He states that the most peaceful nations in Europe are the so-called “weak” nations of Scandinavia. He thinks the Russian people are pushing all obstacles out of their way and will have good success.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font9"> NATIVE snatched a girl’s bag from her and received a six months’ sentence of hard labor. A farmer discharged a loaded rifle at a native laborer on his farm because the native refused to obey an order to plow his land, saying, “It is the day for plowing our own lands.” The farmer shot the native in both feet, inflicting injuries which deprived the native of the use of his feet for more than six months and which may leave him a cripple. The magistrate, in sentencing the farmer, fined him fifteen pounds or six weeks’ imprisonment with hard labor. A native who was one of a gang that robbed and assaulted a storekeeper was sentenced to five years’ hard labor and six strokes. A farm manager, not yet sentenced, has been committed for trial foi’ shooting through the knee a native who had a stick in his hand which the accused ordered him to throve away. The native refused, as he was merely resting the stick on the ground, and the farm manager then proceeded to fetch his gun and shoot the native. But the most outstanding case of injustice recently is perhaps that in which a white man and a native woman were brought before the same circuit court on consecutive days, charged with cohabitation, which between white and native is an indictable offense. The native woman pleaded </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">guilty</span><span class="font9"> and was given a severe sentence; the white man pleaded not guilty and was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acquitted.</span><span class="font9"> [Shades of Pilate and Judge Howe!—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fl/F'A ANIIA AR,</span><span class="font9"> The Adventures- of a Lion 20. Family and Other East African Sketches, is an interesting little book for lovers of wild life. It is by A. A, Pienaar, a young South African, who spent his boyhood days in the home of the big game now being so rapidly decimated. It is said every word in the book is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The things of nature are the things of God, and no one with the right- kind of heart can read of the sufferings of two little lion cubs, robbed of father, mother, brother and the four other adult members of the family by the rifles of the white hunters, without feeling a pang of remorse. And when the little fellows are finally adopted by another pack, after eating parts of their own mother, and suffering much from fright and thirst, over a period of weeks, he is as glad as can be. The orphans have found a home and will be cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is another touching story of a babyrhinoceros and a baby hippopotamus made orphans in the same way. With all four of their parents slain by the hunters, these little fellow’s made friends with each other and remained true friends over a period of five years, shunning all other companionships, even of their own kind. At length the hunters got. the hippo; and the rhino, born and bred in the district, was so disheartened that solitary, and evidently sad, he left the home of his youth for a district far away, doubtless hoping for a happy land where he could live in comfort- without the scourge of the rifle crack he has so come to hate and fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The book takes the reader into the jungle, and the experiences of these great- wild creatures become, in sympathy, his own. The wild life kill and eat one another, it is true, but he almost wishes that man would keep out of it and not ruthlessly take the lives of any of God’s creatures just for sport</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">When the churches are active it means something to a community. Susquehanna, Oakland and Lanesboro are blessed with clergymen who know how and are energetic enough to lead their flocks along interesting pathways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is why Susquehanna has more church members in proportion to the population than any other community in this section of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More power to the preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hardly was this benediction of the clergy in. print before, early next morning, five carloads of Jehovah’s witnesses, consisting of eighteen, active adults, and six of their little ones, out for a good time, began calling at every home with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When was an editorial in behalf of the preachers more promptly blessed? And as to leading<sup>1 </sup>their flocks along interesting pathways, what pathway could be more interesting (to them) than the novel pathway of the pure and undefiled truth contained in that little book by Judge Rutherford? The joke of it is that the workers in Susquehanna did not know about the editorial until they were on their way back home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">How Will World-wide Peace Be Secured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hl HE idea of universal peace is to many probably nothing more than a Utopian dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They consider it to be merely an ideal born o£ an earnest desire for release from the conditions of warfare and bloodshed which have marked the history of earth. Nearly everybody will readily agree that it would be a wonderful and desirable thing if every possibility of war were for ever removed! But it is quite evident that this condition of things does not exist to- ' day. There seem to be continual war clouds on the horizon. Newspapers give forceful testimony to the fact that the thought of war is altogether too much in evidence. The war that is quite fittingly called the “World War” was supposed to be the last. Indeed, it was fought to end war. We might wish that this were true. But it appears to be a doubtful matter, with the odds against peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">War is by no means a laughing matter. One can even imagine that the subject is so distasteful to some that there may be those who will be inclined to turn away to consider something more pleasant. I therefore hasten to assure you that I am not going to be pessimistic. On the contrary, I feel absolutely certain that in the not far distant future universal peace will be a reality. This, no doubt, is saying a great deal. Let us, then, go on with the subject, first -quickly considering the evils of war, and then viewing with pleasure a warless world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">War never was a desirable thing. It is now less so than ever before. From one of our national weeklies the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If there is not the slightest hope for world peace, then wo might as well prepare to close the books of civilization. Military and scientific authorities leave us no doubt that another world war would be mass extermination. Squadrons of battle planes, as numerous almost as the fall flight of birds, would descend on combatant countries, and these migrations would lay continents in ruin. There are no limits to the possibilities of scientific destruction. Give our general staffs and our laboratories a little more time, and they will hatch out plans and devices for the orderly and complete annihilation of nations. Give the war lords another fling, and a thousand years from now perhaps a new race may begin to excavate the ruins of our cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It further says that “the great mass of the people, who bear the burdens both of war and of peace, would not willingly engage again in armed comba.t. „ <sub>0 0</sub> It is a safe assumption that if the common people had their way there would, be tranquillity in Europe today. Someone has said that wars are fought by young men with ideals, while treaties are negotiated by old men with boils”; in other words, soreheads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not all the common people, however, are so peacefully inclined as this writer suggests. This is shown by the fact that there is much of internal trouble in practically every country on the face of the globe. Frequently we find individuals who are pugnacious enough in their contacts with other people but who nevertheless would raise strenuous objections to engaging in armed conflict beween nations. But doubtless there are many people who sincerely desire peace and who strive to be peacemakers in the ordinary affairs of life. To such the thought of war and the things associated with it is painful even though they themselves might not suffer to any great extent in the event of war. The writer whose words have just been quoted does not picture anything very pleasing. Even if exaggerated, there is certainly a great deal of truth in it: so much of it, indeed, is true that it may well make us think seriously. When we consider that efforts at disarmament have resulted in practically complete failure, and when we remember that the hope that the use of gas and disease bombs might be held within bounds has been practically abandoned, it makes us wonder what we are coming to. The illustration given by a former secretary of war, to the effect that the world resembled a heap of highly combustible explosives which might be set off at any moment, is not overdrawn. The same speaker said, “Let another such catastrophe happen as occurred in 1914 and our children and their children will have to live in a world unspeakably unhappy.” To which we might add, fif they live at all.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But this is merely viewing things that might happen. How may it be avoided? Can any human agency stop the ever-increasing horror of war? Preventive measures have been suggested: arbitration, or a union of all nations in a league which would have for its objective the abolition of war. Arbitration has been tried and has resulted in doing some good, but it has not in the least affected the problem as a whole. As for a league to abolish war: We have such a league, but its progress in the accomplishment of its supposed object has been so insignificant that it is now apparent to all that, whatever its</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">avowed purpose, there is no real intention on the part of those concerned to make peace their primary consideration. The league may be defined as the realization of the dream of an idealist who has been employed by scheming politicians for the attaining of the selfish and unjust desires of powerful nations. You ask, Is it not being supported by many noble-minded men and women? Yes, but this does not necessarily argue that it is therefore using its powers for the real well-being of mankind. The nations of which the league is composed are by no means righteous, and their objectives have only too evidently proven themselves to be selfish and unjust. Since these nations are individually of this character, what can be expected of a combination of such nations. Does it not argue that if they do succeed in working together it will only be to advance their own interests at the expense of other nations not represented, or at the expense of its own weaker members? Consequently little can be expected, and little is expected, of the league as far as making the world safe is concerned. It is quite safe to say that not one iota of real progress has it made toward the ideal of universal peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Where, then, can we find a means to bring about peace ? you will ask. If the united efforts of the nations themselves cannot accomplish the desired result, what can accomplish it? If the most capable and intelligent of human creatures cannot formulate some plan to bring about peace, what or who can? It is evident that peace among nations demands some method of cooperation ami a means by which there can be a harmonious adjustment of their individual and common interests. It is also necessary that the decision as to what part each nation or group of people shall play in the general scheme must come from an entirely impartial and unprejudiced source. Further, the governing head or body must have complete authority to enforce its decisions in a wise and effective manner and must have the power to exercise that authority. Tremendous difficulties here present themselves, as is evident from the experience of the league. Apparently no arrangement can be made which will meet all these requirements. Human resources are inadequate for the exigencies of the case. Humanity has indeed come to the point where it realizes the absolute need of such an international governing power, but at the same time it is increasingly evident that there are no materials at hand which will enable men to bring it into being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A further requirement to accomplish full and harmonious cooperation would be the willingness of the various nations and their peoples to abide by the decisions of the governing body. The peoples must have confidence in the integrity, good intentions and ability of this body. They must be persuaded that its commands and instructions are the best that could possibly be had and that there are no means of improving upon them. Here again we have a condition which is lacking in the present world situation. We find, for instance, that when the league recently decided upon a certain course, two of its members became offended and withdrew. Mo doubt they had cause for offense; but the point to be noted is that the league and its arrangements came short of ability to supply the needs of the peoples concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is evident that human plans cannot bring about universal peace. All the plans that have been advanced come short. We find that they seek to treat the symptoms instead of treating the disease itself. War is only the symptom of a deep-seated and malignant malady, and treating the symptoms will do no good. We must have the cause of the trouble removed, and then other matters will gradually be adjusted properly. The cause back of all war, discord and strife is human selfishness and sin. While these heart conditions remain no amount of superficial cooperation will do away with Avar and the causes that lead up to it. A. league of nations will only be used to accomplish selfish ends as long as it is under the control of selfish interests. Some sort of universal cooperation is necessary, but it must be a cooperation based upon the right. The balance of power, so to speak, must he in the hands of the honest, and true and righteously disposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now note what the Bible says about the matter. Speaking prophetically it says, ‘&quot;The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.” (Dan. 7:7) This divine provision meets the needs of the world exactly. It provides for a universal government. It further assures that the governing body shall be righteous and possess complete authority. The word “saints” means righteous or holy ones, not in the sense of sanctimoniousness or ultra-religiousness, but rather in the sense of complete devotion to God and the right. When we examine the Scriptures upon this point we are indeed gratified and rejoiced to find them consistently and continually maintaining the promise of a coming universal reign of peace. While the course of evil has apparently gone its way unchecked, God long-ago determined upon a time, when the kingdom of righteousness shall be established. Let us look over some of the passages which tell about this coming time of blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First of all, there is that well known passage in Micah 4:1-4. Here the kingdom of God is represented in figure as a “mountain”. Having in mind that according to the interpretation given by Daniel a mountain represents a kingdom or government, we can readily understand the meaning of this passage. Just substitute the word kingdom or government for mountain and hill, and you have the thought very clearly expressed. Tn the last days [of the rule of' evil] shall the kingdom of the people of Jehovah be established in the ascendancy over other kingdoms, and it shall be exalted above all other governments, and all people shall flow into it. And many nations shall say, Come, and let us go up to the kingdom of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Israel, and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For the law shall go forth from Zion and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations and rebuke strong peoples afar off, and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks. Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and figtree and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts has spoken it/ “'Zion” and “Jerusalem” here refer to God’s government or organization. It is altogether probable that this government will have a visible seat at Jerusalem in the land of Palestine, but the real government or kingdom will be spiritual, and not human or earthly, as we shall see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As noted from Daniel 7:27, the Kingdom authority will be given to the saints. Another verse in the same book shows that it will be given to one who is called “the Son of man”. The thought is clear. The Son of man is Jesus, who will be the great King of kings and Lord of lords, and the saints will be the kings and lords over which Jesus will be head or chief. These together constitute the great governing body which will establish the world in righteousness and bring about peace which will be eternal in duration, for we are assured that of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.—Isa. 9: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us examine other scriptures which give us detailed information concerning the selection and preparation of this kingly body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The head, Christ Jesus, was first called and prepared for the high position which He was to occupy. We read, “Though he was a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he endured.” (Heb. 5: 8, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font9"> F.) It has been well said that he who would rule must first learn to obey, and this wmiiderful King was trained in the high quality of absolute obedience to God and the laws of righteousness. Further, we read concerning Jesus, “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” (Heb. 1:9) The expression ‘anointing’ refers to a ceremony by which the kings and priests of Israel wore inducted into office. This figure is applied to our Lord Jesus, but He was not anointed with literal oil, but with the holy spirit, which qualified Him for His high office. Notice, too, that He is anointed above His fellows, or as head over His fellows. The “fellows” or associates are the faithful followers of the Master, as we shall see. In the position which Christ occupies the kingly and priestly office combine. The priestly office makes Him an intermediary between God and mankind. As the peoples of the world are imperfect, they require not merely a wise and just ruler, but also one who can intercede for them before the bar of divine justice. We must -remember, however, that it was God’s love that-prompted him to make all these arrangements, and therefore the arrangement for an intercessor does not imply an absence of love and good will on the part of the Creator, but rather His provision for maintaining the inviolability of His just laws which cannot be set aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus is spoken of as a high priest after the order of Melchisedec. Melchisedec was a type or figure of Christ as king and priest, for in this ancient figure the priestly and kingly office</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">were united. The name “Melchisedec” means “king of righteousness” ; and as Melchisedec ruled over a city called “Salem”, meaning “peace”, he was also ‘king of peace’. How harmoniously and beautifully the various features of the Bible fit into each other when we properly understand them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here, then, we have the King of glory, who as the King of kings and Lord of lords will bring universal peace and blessing to the world by establishing righteousness. In the book of Revelation He is shown as overcoming the great organization of the wicked one and completely destroying it, thus making way for the kingdom of light, life and love divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But let us review some of the scriptures which tell of this great Ruler. His coming was foretold about four thousand years before He actually came into the world. Our first parents were told that ‘the offspring of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head’. This was but another way of saying that some day a great deliverer w’ould be born into the world and that he would be the one who would overcome the Devil and destroy his works. Subsequently it was shown that this great leader would be one of the descendants of Abraham, to whom God said, “In thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” This promise was confirmed to Abraham’s son Isaac, and to Isaac’s son Jacob, who later was called “Israel”. Thus it was definitely established that the coming universal king would be born of Israel. By a prophecy inspired by the holy spirit of God, it was made known that Jacob’s son Judah would be the progenitor of the promised seed. But when or of what particular family he would be born remained a mystery until at the time of David, king of Israel, the promise was narrowed down to the Davidic line. It was promised that one of David’s descendants would be an everlasting king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a descendant of David through his son Nathan. This particular line had been lost in obscurity, but it was protected by Jehovah, while the line of descent was carefully preserved in the records which Israel kept of all its families. When the birth of Jesus was announced, the angel said to Mary, “Thou shalt . . . bring forth a son, and shaft call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (Luke 1: 31-33) This was in fulfilment of Isaiah’s prophecy (9: 6, 7), “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before Jesus’ death, resurrection and ascension, He promised His disciples a place in His kingdom, assuring them that they should possess the kingdom, inasmuch as it was God’s good pleasure to give it to them. (Luke 12: 32) This same promise extends to all of Jesus’ faithful followers. It is to this comparatively small group that Jesus’ promises and instructions are given. These have been called upon to endure much persecution, difficulty and suffering because of their loyalty to Him, but to them is the assurance: “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.” (2 Tim. 2:12) For them, hardships for Jesus arc indeed but light afflictions while, they look not at the things that are seen but at the unseen things which God has in reservation for them. For them God is working out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Their present experiences are intended to prepare them for the glorious position they are to hold when the times of regeneration and reconstruction bring to the world the long-sought-for peace. So the Apostle Peter says, “But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.” “Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.” (1 Pet. 5:10; 4:13) In Revelation these are pictured as standing with Christ upon Mount Zion, which represents the official part of God’s kingdom. Of them it is said that ‘they follow the Lamb [representing Jesus] wheresoever He goes’.—Rev. 14:1, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They have part in the first resurrection and shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years. The thousand years are the times of reconstruction, during which the world will be restored to perfect harmony with God and consequent happiness, peace and contentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Realizing the wonderful position these loyal followers of Christ are to occupy, we can appreciate why at present they are called upon to endure something for His sake. It should not surprise us that true Christians do not get on in the world. They are not popular, for Jesus had said to them, “Woe unto you when all men speak well of you.” They are not appreciated any more than Jesus was appreciated in His time. Nevertheless, they are and have been the salt of the earth and are the truest and best friends of their fellow men. Their experiences enable them to sympathize with others, and while they are seldom rich in material things, they are rich spiritually. They are rich in faith, as states the Apostle James, and to them are given the promises of exceeding riches of grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' These, then, together with Christ as their Head, will constitute the supreme governing body that will administer the affairs of the ■ world in the age that is now dawning. They will not merely have to. do with affairs international, but will also instruct the nations with regard to policies of internal government. Education, transportation, and every conceivable interest of the human family will in some manner be supervised and directed so as to be in exact line with the requirements of perfect justice. No injustices or unrighteousness will be tolerated then. Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all the world, for the earth shall be full of the true knowledge of Jehovah, not merely a superficial or counterfeit knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As already intimated, these kingly and priestly rulers will have earthly representatives. Who ■will, they be ? The eleventh chapter of Hebrews calls to our attention an array of faithful, Godly people who lived before Christ. These could not be followers of Jesus, of course. Jesus was the first of the ruling class, and He was the one who opened up the 'way for others to that position of honor. Therefore those ’who lived before He came into the world could not be of the heavenly kingdom class. The Apostle Paul, however, assures us that they received a good report through faith, and that they are to.have a better resurrection than the world of mankind. These are the fathers who in the forty-fifth Psalm are referred to as the princes who are to reign in all the earth. The world of mankind will be privileged to come in touch with these, for they</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">will be seen of men. Thus we read, “Ye shall see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God.” Further, we are told that others will in due time share with them the honors of the Kingdom. “'They shall come from the east, and from the west, and. from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God”; that is, they will assume positions in the affairs- of the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ki</span><span class="font9">ngdom when they are qualified to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The worthy ones of the Old Testament will no doubt retain the position of chief honor among men as the representatives of the invisible Christ body beyond human sight. Of that time we read, “Behold a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” This refers to Jesus and His followers unitedly as Oring”, and to these worthies as ■ “princes”. Then we are told that “the eyes of them, that see shall not be dim: and the ears of them that hear shall hearken”. This confirms the statement of the prophet to the effect that “the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord”. Even the heart of the stupid shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. “The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.” (Isa. 32: 5) This condition will establish society upon a basis of real 'worth and will result in righteousness’ con. trolling the interests of the people. Further, ■we are told that then judgment shall dwell in the earth which was formerly like a wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field of humanity. “And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. And my people [the willing and obedient] shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.”—Isa. 32:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus the desire of mankind for peace and - righteousness and happiness will be fulfilled. God’s provisions meet all the needs of the situation. A wise, just and all-powerful government will be in control of all the affairs of the earth and will administer them for the benefit of the people as a whole, and not for the advantage of the few. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible thus again proves itself to be inspired and the revelation of God’s glorious purposes. Just at a time when the world is beginning to realize the need, the Book of books comes with the assurance of this wonderful provision</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">which God has made to bring universal peace to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Finally, the time is here for these prophecies to be fulfilled. The evidences multiply on every hand that we are already in the transition period and that the new. age, the new world, is upon us. These evidences are graphically portrayed in numerous scriptures which are corroborated by the signs of the times and current events. These are helpfully explained in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance,</span><span class="font9"> and other books written by Judge Rutherford. The sole object of that writer and his associates is to point to presentday developments of God’s purposes and to proclaim by radio, by word of mouth and by the printed page that “the Kingdom of heaven is at hand”, and that peace on earth, good will to men, will soon be a glorious reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Radio Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font9">EMPHIS, Tex. “On last Sunday I was permitted to listen in on an address by Judge Rutherford, if I got the name correctly, and was so interested that I tried to get the name of a book or pamphlet which he said I might get by writing to your address. You may know what it is. The address was very instructive and in my line of study, but I was not prepared to take down the title and the address.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Omaha,</span><span class="font9"> Nebr. “Your Sunday morning talks interest me very much and I would be pleased indeed to receive a copy of them in their entirety. While I am only one of your listeners (and there must be millions), nevertheless I feel I would like to thank you for the great work you are doing, and the enlightenment and good I have received from your talks. May God bless and prosper you in the good work you are doing for Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Akron,</span><span class="font9"> Ohio. (To Station WGAR, Cleveland) “I am writing through your station to the Red and Blue networks in general in regard to J. F. Rutherford’s talks on religion. I feel the same as many others undoubtedly feel. That is, if Judge Rutherford has been denied the right of free speech over these two broadcasting chains, in regard to expressing his views on the Word of God, it is a grave injustice and in direct violation of the constitution, a suppression of free speech. Our constitution allows every American to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience, so long as God is held as the Supreme Being. And if the above networks have been a party to this oppression I hope you receive a million letters in protest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From a Radio Station Manager</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[Comments on Judge Rutherford’s addresses, received from a radio station manager in Colorado. The manager’s personal comments appear in brackets.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;DROMINENT member of Ministerial Alliance -L stated he felt the talks were propaganda designed to hurt the recognized churches of the country and wished he could do something about it. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[Maybe he does.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prominent Catholic leader, lay, called up and said he wanted to know what time the lecture was on the air, because he had had many comments about it and about the way certain matters were presented, and he wanted to hear one himself so he could see what [this station] was saying about Catholics. [Expect to hear from him again in a few days or next time we see </span><span class="font8">him.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pentacostal minister who broadcasts every Sunday said that he enjoyed hearing the lectures occasionally to see if there wwre any points he could find different answers to. [He didn’t say whether he succeeded or not.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A listener called up September 27 after the lecture and said he enjoyed the lecture, and wanted the address of Watchtower again so he could write for bulletin. Numerous others have called in, stating that they enjoyed lecture, and listened regularly. Also had a letter from a man in Iowa who wanted to know when Rutherford’s lectures were on the air in ——■—, for he intended to visit this vicinity soon and wanted to be sure he heard the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What the Church Has Done</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">oger</span><span class="font9"> W. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Babson,</span><span class="font9"> famous statistician, is out with a book entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Fundamentals of Prosperity,</span><span class="font9"> in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is the church which has created America, which has developed our schools, which has created our homes, which has built our cities, which has developed our industries, which has made our hospitals, charities, and which has done everything that is worth while in America. Try as you will, you cannot separate the factor of religion from economic development, We have figures charted back for the past fifty years. Whenever this line of religious interest turns downward and reaches a low level, history shows that it is time to prepare for a. reaction and depression in business conditions. Every great panic we have ever had has been foreshadowed by a general decline in observance of religious principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We wonder at Mr. Babson’s saying just enough to whet our curiosity and then dropping such an interesting theme. We carry it further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the church that created the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and “the rocks and rills, the woods and templed hills” between them; the church cut down our trees and dug out their stumps; the church picked off the stones and planted our orchards, fields and gardens; the church milked our cows, pitched our hay and chopped our wood; the church made us wash our face and hands and comb our hair; the church licked us for telling fibs, for fighting at school, and for raiding orchards and berry patches; the church dug our coal and iron ore, built our railroads, roads and bridges; the church looked to see if our ears and the back of our necks were clean; the church darned our socks, patched our trousers, and kept our underwear mended: the church ran our typewriters, printing presses and mowing machines; the church dug our potatoes and gathered the apples off the trees; the church put the rings around Saturn, washed the dishes, did the baking, and spanked the kids and put them to bed when they well deserved it; the church got up at four o’clock in the morning and hustled till after dark to bring in enough provender for the hungry. The church dug the canals on Mars, put the man in the moon, located Niagara Falls right where it is and saw to it that, come Saturday night, everybody in the house was well washed and had the nails trimmed on each of the four corners of his body. Next day the church did a big wash, shod six teams of horses and put new spokes in three of the four wheels on the old democrat wagon. Some church!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Little Folks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font4">HILDREN usually come into the world one at a time, and even if they do occasionally come as twins, and more rarely as triplets, every one of them brings his own problems. Nature evidently intended that they should be handled singly, and not in masses. They are happiest and make the best development that way, and yet, odd little sinners, they almost have to have the companionship of other children, to bring them up right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, little folks are little folks for a long time, even after their bodies are of large size, because the mind continues to expand. In our day men are counted mature at 21 and women at 18, but the divine regulation of the affairs of the Jewish people fixed the maturity of men at 30 years, and that is about right. He is then in possession of his full powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The way it works out now, a man develops for thirty years, works for thirty years, de-'•ays for ten years, and dies at seventy, wondering why it took so long Lor him to get ready to do so little. Nearly half his life is spent in getting ready to do something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the little folks at about two years of age are not so pleasant to have around. Not a few of them, naturally endowed by their parents with considerable destructiveness, cxecutive-ness, manifest it in ways that are a trial to the more civilized, seeming to think that to wreck everything in sight is life’s main objective. Tlmy usually have to feel, the strong arm of parental law to got them out of that frame of mind, and it takes time, and patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present, and gro-w ingly popular misconception of a destructive or wayward child, that it should be studied and not punished occasionally, is nonsense. The Scriptures say that one may ‘spare the red and spoil the child’, and it is true. At the same time, punishment is often greatly overdone; and with a nervous, sensitive, conscientious child, is rarely necessary, and may take a very mild form and be completely effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Children should be brought up, but not overgroomed. More harm has been done by overbringing-up than by under-bringing-up. In the period of youth the child learns how to become a satisfactory member of his family and of the human family, and he learns it best with as little detailed guidance as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Parents should not strive to make their children feel that they are dependent upon them for guidance. No parent knows enough to guide all the details of any child’s life, and if lie did, and used the knowledge, and the child submitted to it, the child would never amount to anything in this world. He would be an automaton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A child that never has a chance to use his own judgment will never have any judgment to use. A parent that seeks to order all the affairs of a child is a despot, a kind-hearted tyrant perhaps, but a tyrant nevertheless: and the rule of even the most benevolent of despots is irksome. A good example on the part of the parents is the best instruction the child can ever have. Words are not so effective: talk is cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very best that a parent can do for a child is to truly Jove him. Love 'will know when to speak and when not to speak, when to act and when not to act, its object being at all times to help the child to grow up to a place where he can take •.-are of himself, lie independent, Le a care to nobody, but, on the contrary, be groomed to be a help to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The child gives as much as he gets, perhaps more. It would be impossible to gauge the benefit that has come to men and women through association with the fresh, sweet, unspoiled minds of little folks. They have been described as ‘the greatest civilizers and hmnanizers of the race’.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>■n. QOLDEN</span><span class="font6"> AQE</span></h3>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Country the Best</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">The country is the best place to bring up children. They learn to find companionship in the trees, the streams, the camp fires, the wild life, the changing seasons, the skies, the weather, a thousand things that the child brought up on the pavements hardly senses. One-half the children are now brought up in the city. It cannot well be helped at present, but it is not the. best place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Boy Scout movement tri.es to accomplish something in the way of getting city boys out into the country, and there are other moves to the same end, but the boys are necessarily compelled to travel in droves and to move almost mechanically, and this has its drawbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the inception of the Children’s Bureau in 1912 there has been much more attention paid to child rearing in America than was ever done previously. This bureau was created as a research bureau, directed to “investigate and report upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time the bureau was formed only one state had a bureau of child health; now’ they are to be found in half of the states. At the time the bureau was formed there were about two million child workers; according to latest reports there are now only about half that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bureau was a prominent factor in the recent White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. At that conference Secretary Wilbur said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We attempt to herd all our children under 16 into the school rooms for a considerable number of hours each day for a considerable number of months, using their eyes and their brains in a certain way. We have increased the number of noise-making devices, raised the speed of our activities; we have brought in the moving picture, the radio, the phonograph. We are exposing our youth to an enormous series of influences and are becoming conscious that we have done something to rob them of their natural opportunities. Those of us who have a large university responsibility have thought a good deal about this question. For the most part we find that the students who come to us are physically competent, honest&quot; clean and square. They think straight and true. But we find, too, that those students who come from the smaller communities seem to do the best; mass living gives us the poorest we get. And so I say mass living for children must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The awakening in the United States on the question of the importance of giving the children at least, an opportunity to get into the country is part of the general awakening now under way everywhere. In Austria during the last ten years 75,000 young workers have been given vacations in the country at nominal expense. The average vacation period is four weeks. Proper food and outdoor exercise and recreation are provided. The cost of the country homes is met by sicknessinsurance funds, appropriations by the national and local governments and the fees paid by the young vacationists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A survey of the physical growth and mental attainment of the boys and girls of New Zealand, which included 20,000 town and country children ranging in age from ten to fourteen, showed that farm children are superior to city-reared children and that this superiority is most pronounced at the age of thirteen.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Keeping the Kiddies Well</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">It is not so easy to keep the children well. Most of them are now born in the cities, where the sunlight is deficient and the air is vitiated and impure. Fruits and vegetables can be had in greater profusion than ever before, it is true, and these are first aids to health; but the milk is pasteurized, too much of the bread is white bread, and too much of the food has the life refrigerated out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Probably the worst thing the city-bred child has to contend with is the injection into his blood of poisoned calf blood and poisoned horse blood, in the superstition that they will prevent him from catching some of the numerous diseases of childhood and maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every year the automobile takes a very large toll of the lives of childhood. Some of this great waste of precious lives can be prevented by having the children memorize the following eleven rules for safety, put out by Morgan’s Message:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Walk on the left side of the road, facing the approaching traffic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. When in groups, walk in single file.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Before crossing the street, look first to the left, then to the right.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Do not play games along the street or highway while at school or while going to and from school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. Do not roller-skate in the street or on the highway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. Do not heedlessly run into the street or highway after a ball.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. Do not hitch on to trolley ears, wagons oi’ automobiles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8. Do not nm into the street or highway from behind parked autos or moving vehicles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">9. Do not hold an umbrella, on rainy days, in a manner that will obstruct your view of the road in front.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">10. Never ride a bicycle on the highway for sport. When riding one, keep close to the right side of the road.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">11. Do not beg or accept a ride from strangers along a highway.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">May 1 has been officially proclaimed by President Hoover as National Child Health Day; but let us all make every day a child health day. The most beautiful thing in life is a child, and the most eare-iTee. Do not fuss over a child’s health, but out of the corner of your eye see to it that he gets enough rest, food of the right kind and the right quantity at the right time, and properly masticates it, and that he gets enough exercise, but not too much. If a child seems to be lazy he is ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a general rule a child two years old is half the height he will be when he is fully grown. Height depends a great deal on the kind of food supplied to a child during the growing period. But there are abnormalities. The kind of food given him would hardly account for the fact that at 6-J years Harold Hines, of Morristown, Tenn., weighed 165 pounds.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Children in Institutions</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">That headline ought not to be necessary, for there should be no children in institutions. The poorest kind of home, where there is mother love in it, is better than any institutional home. The United States is the most institution-ridden country in the world, and is behind the times in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most pathetic part of the population of the United States is the 125,000 little children in the orphan asylums, receiving a little attention on December 25, hut for most of the year unnoticed, neglected, and often sick, half-starved and half-educated, under the ill-paid care of those who have little or no real interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the dependent children in institutions there are 300,000 that are wholly or partially supported in. their own or other private homes. The average cost of maintaining a child in an orphan asylum is around $40 a month, while in its own home it can be maintained for about $17 a month. New York city’s allowance for boarding dependent children in private homes is now $7.65 a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York state has over 30,000 children being housed and trained in institutions. England has 60,000. If all their caretakers loved them and were kind to them most of these children would grow up to be kind; but if they are cruel it is inevitable that many of the children will be cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other side of the ledger, working against cruelty in private homes, is the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which in 1929 in New York took care of 5,577 children, in addition to looking after complaints of cruelty, abuse, neglect, improper guardianship, etc., of about 12,000 more not taken from their homes. The Society prosecuted 870 adults for crimes against children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Finding Homes for Little Folks</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">To provide a helpless little child with a good home and with the parental affection which it craves and which it must have if it is to bloom into happy youth and maturity, is one of the greatest works in which any man or woman can engage, and a work that has its own reward in the doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For seventy-five years, under the management of Charles Loring Brace, father and son, the Children’s Aid Society of New York has been placing thousands of children in homes, on farms or in villages away from the city streets and away from the regimentation of the orphan asylums. About $2,000,000 a year is spent in this work and in improving the condition of the city’s under-privileged children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The position is well taken that while in a wellmanaged public institution the child might have better physical care, and perhaps better mental training, yet in a home where it can have discipline tempered with love and sympathy and understanding, it is far better off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the children which it aids in finding better homes than the city streets provide, the Children’s Aid Society is also responsible for getting about 250 babies adopted each year. The demand is three times the supply. The favorite brand is a blond baby girl.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Uses and Abuses of Imagination,</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Find a person that is without imagination, and you find one of the most utterly uninteresting persons in the vwld. Such a person cannot even read the Bible understandingly, for it is impossible to read a hook filled with pictures, figures or symbols if one has no imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It cannot be charged against children that they are without imagination. About one-third of all children tell fibs. Under the age of five ' there is no conscious falsehood, but imagination runs riot and requires thereafter to be gently guided into the realm of reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the lessons that a child learns in the home are from contact with the things that are discarded. The scrap bag, with its bits of cloth of all textures and colors, offers fine training for the eyes and fingers. There is a time when the child wishes to touch everything with which he comes in contact. Let him do it: it is a necessary part of his education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Children should never be frightened. A three-year-old child playing in the yard of a farmhouse near Sandusky, Ohio, was frightened to death by the terrifying spectacle of a goose, attacking with bill and flapping wings. Two parents in Georgia locked a three-year-old daughter in a clothes closet and later found her strangled by a eoachwhip snake that had secreted itself there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In New York a boy endured for four days the pain of a bullet in his abdomen, and finally died in agony, because he dared not tell his parents he had been playing with a forbidden rifle. At Point Pleasant, N. J., a three-year-old child died of fright when a dog that had been sent in a crate to her father jumped upon her from the crate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Health, Cedtuve</span><span class="font4"> tells of a boy whose health ■was undermined from seeing a film called &quot;'The Haunted Bedroom”. For three; years after that he was accustomed to awake from his sleep declaring that the ghosts were coming. Quite probably the demons took advantage of his fear to invade his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes a boy’s inquisitiveness gets him into trouble, but even then it should not be discouraged. At Cambridge, Mass., an eight-year-old boy was studiously watching the mechanism of a rotary sweeper, when he was picked up by its revolving brush and swept into its reservoir with a bundle of leaves. He was not injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen the children of Copenhagen, Denmark, had a great time. Not only were they given a holiday for the day, but lemonade and orangeade 'were free to them all over town all day, and free chocolates and candies were also distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The years of imagination are soon over. In after life the rills of childhood that once seemed like little rivers grow smaller and smaller in the mind’s eye, and the hills that once seemed to be imposing heights are seen as but small elevations, without lure and without romance.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Social Instincts of Children</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">The social instincts of children are more pronounced than those of grown people. They demand the companion ship of those of approximately the same age, and will do almost anything to get it. A house full of children is sure to be full to overflowing, not merely with its own children, but with all the boys and girls of the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Frequently the New York newspapers contain the letters of little girls expressing their desire for addition to the families of their parents. Little Audrey Schlipp, eight years old, wanted a baby sister and took definite steps to get one. She wrote to the Long Island College Hospital:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'All the other children have sisters or brothers and I haven’t any. I want a sister' to play with and to mind. I spoke to mother and dad about it, but they just put mo off. I saw in the newspapers that the Long Island College Hospital has a whole lot of new babies, so I thought they could send one of them down here. It seems mother will take eare of it if it comes here, but she doesn’t want to go after it. If I knew the way, I’d go after it myself.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little nine-year-old boy in Boston stole $20 from his teacher not long ago, and when the matter got into the hands of Boston's Institute for Guidance in Childhood and Youth the Foundation discovered that the child had bought shoes and stockings for his younger brothers and sisters and had spent only twenty cents upon himself. He had the makings of a Wall Street philanthropist, only he was much move unselfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What was it that made three-year-old Richard Moore climb out of bed at two-thirty in the morning and go out into the street barefoot, clad only in his pa.jamas? He paraded around for an hour, until a taxicab driver found him and took him to a hospital for the remainder of the night. Even then he did not want to go to bed. He told the nurses he wanted to make a night of it. He was a typical son of some New York city fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What was it that made Jerry Postora, seven years old, climb up the front of a building to the cornice on the second floor? Jerry started in a bad line of business. When he got up one flight he could not got hack, and he had to hang on while they sent for the lire department to rescue him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The officials of the Palisades Interstate Park are making the boys socially-minded by compelling offenders to learn to recite the park ordinances by heart when they are caught doing damage. This method of disciplining boys for tearing up young trees and destroying flowers is said to work well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is claimed by some that every boy should grow up with a dog, on the ground that it will make the boy a fairer, kinder, truer man. The Greenwich </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joxtrnal</span><span class="font4"> says: “He will learn to love fairness, justice and mercy, just as he will come to hate meanness, cruelty and cowardice, through daily contact with his big-eyed, shaggy-coated, understanding friend.” But we remark that there are some dogs, not many, however, that really seem to have as mean disposition as any human could possibly have. Such a dog is of no benefit to anybody, and one wonders why some dogs are allow’ed to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this matter of the social instincts of children, students of such subjects have pointed out that in their association one with another children pass around the world the rhymes that they repeat in their games at recess. Some of these rhymes are ancient, some are adapted from folklore, and some are modern. They pass from place to place, from country to country, and from generation to generation, without the intervention of the printing press, a survival of the days of minstrelsy.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Baboon and Wolf Foster-Children’</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Some twenty-five years ago the South African police, in a barren stretch of country, came across a pack of baboons and fired upon them. As the men fired the beasts scattered; but one of them lagged behind and, though he proved to be a slippery customer, was captured. He turned out to he a native boy that had been captured by the baboons while he was still a baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After a year in a hospital he learned to speak a little English, and in time disclosed the habits of his baboon friends. He had no idea of time, not even of the meaning of sunset or sunrise. He remembered how during cold nights one of the baboons had been in the habit of holding him in his arms, to shield him from the cold, and how they appeased their constant hunger by eating crickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When captured lie was running about on all fours;but he learned to walk upright, and could </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">run a </span><span class="font4">ten-mile errand without stopping for breath, lie could lift and carry </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">two iOO-pound </span><span class="font4">sacks of grain. He had almost no memory, and was capable only of doing what he was told at the moment the order was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the province of Oudh, India, in times past, several native children have been adopted by wolves and been recovered to civilization. One such was found at Maiwana, seventy-five miles from Allahabad, in 1927. The child is able to walk, but at times prefers to crawl, sitting on his haunches with his legs curled underneath him, and propelling himself forward with the palms of his hands on the ground. Having lived on roots and herbs for years, he even now eats grass when taken out in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Chupra, India, in 1843, a man and his wife were out in their fields accompanied by their child, marked on one knee by a severe scald. The child was carried off by a wolf, and six years later was recaptured, after a fierce resistance, and plainly recognized by the mother as her child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several “wolf-boys” have been kept at various times at the Secundra Orphanage at Agra. One such was there in 1874, having then been there for nine years and supposed to be about fifteen years old. His arms W’ere but nineteen inches long, due to arrested growth, through his going about on all fours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is supposed that these numerous “wolf-childreij” in India have come about through the fact that in times of famine the parents in this part used often to abandon their children in the forests, and the wolves some years ago were very plentiful. The fact that the wolves kept these human babies instead of eating them shows plainly the reverence which wild animals naturally have for humans, and the love of all mothers and fathers for child life in any form, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The thing works in reverse order too. In New York city it has been found that the best agents of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are the children. The vicinity of Clarkson and Houston Streets, New York, is known by horse drivers as “Animals’ Paradise” because of the close watch that the children of the neighborhood keep as to how the drivers treat the brute beasts under their care.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Juvenile Delinquency</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">It is natural for ail healthy children to keep in motion, and a juvenile delinquent is a child, that, for the time being, is busy in the wrong direction. Some of this delinquency is due to inquisitiveness, a desire to find how far one may go in a 'direction that has the 'disapproval of his elders without getting into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is natural for boys to be mischievous. Mark Twain said that all hoys should be kept in a 'barrel and fed through the bunghole until they reach fourteen years of age, and after that time the bunghole should be closed up. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn were normal boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well recognized by those who have studied the matter that there is a direct relation between the juvenile delinquency of a district and its recreational facilities. Boys and girls must be given something to do or they will do something else. Automobiles have increased juvenile delinquency by taking away from thousands of children the only places where they could play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great majority of delinquents come from areas where bad housing and lack of open play spaces prevent suitable outlet for their energies. Forty percent of juvenile delinquents come from broken homes in which death, desertion, divorce or separation of the parents has disrupted the family.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Delinquency and the World</span><span class="font3"> War</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Much of present delinquency, not only of children, but of adults, can be properly traced to the beastly influence of the World War. When men and wrnmen have their minds filled with hate of their fellow men and disregard of human life, what can be expected of the children that come into the world while their minds are in that condition ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Ronchin, near Lille, France, in 1927, a boy twelve years of age called a five-year-old child to his side with the words, “Come here, I will give you a bonbon.” The tiny boy ran to him, and laughingly the bigger boy pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the throat. When told that the little fellow would probably die, the bigger boy only laughed. There was no feud between the two children. The bigger boy was born in 1915, when the horrors of the World War were at their height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A boy of the same age, at about the same time as the above occurrence, was arrested for planning to blow up a school building in which he had been disciplined. He gave himself away by visiting numerous hardware stores and making inquiries about shells and other explosives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can fairly charge to the World War the intoxication of a nine-year-old boy in the Bronx. He got into his grandmother's cellar and helped himself to a bottle of her cherry wine. But for a well-known war measure, now the laughingstock of the world, she would probably never have thought of making the cherry wine and he would never have thought of drinking it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet the men that were responsible for making the World War as bad as it was are still looked up to in some communities as men to be admired. In York, Pa., five girls and two boys, constituting a shoplifting team, were sentenced to go to their ministers, confess their sins, and attend Sunday school for a three-year probation period.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Delinquency Is Growing</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">One of the saddest things about juvenile 'delinquency is that it is growing. There is a marked tendency among youth to go to the bad. Statistics show that every 'boy in the city, when he reaches the age of sixteen has at least a one-to-three chance that his name will be part of the criminal record ; and in'New Y<sup>r</sup>ork city in 1929 there were more cases of degradation of girls under sixteen than in any other year in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should not be thought that the delinquent children are mostly morons. This is not true. Seventy-six percent of them are normal, and eleven percent of this number are above the average in mentality. Delinquents cannot be made into good men and women in institutions. That work must be done in the future where it lias been done in the past, in the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some parents believe in taking the police into their confidence and giving them a chance to do something before it gets too late. In Springfield, Illinois, eleven-year-old Cedric Dickinson decided that he would not go to bed at his usual time, 8.30 p. m., and went on a rampage. His grandmother telephoned for the police that there was.a wild man in the house. Three husky cops responded and the grandmother explained, “Cedric is wild; he won’t go to bed.” “Yes, I will,” cried Cedric, and he made a dive for the hay and pulled the covers over his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It isn’t only the grandparents that kno-w when to summon the police. A New York lad, Hersey Garfinkle, is only seven years old, but he knows what he wants. He called up the police station and demanded a patrol wagon and a couple of cops in. a hurry. 'There was a good deal of commotion in the station until the man at the desk managed to find out that Hersey’s ten-year-old brother Albert would not let him into the pantry for some crackers and jam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally there is a ease of delinquency which must be charged to the demons. There seems no other way to explain the following speech of a four-year-old child at Chambersburg, Penna., when questioned concerning the death of his mother, who was found with a bullet wound in her neck: “Sure I shot hex. I’d shoot her again if she were here now. I’ll shoot you too, if you don’t lay off me. I killed my mamma because she took the box of matches away from me and told me not to play with them.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Children in Russia</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Before the revolution in Russia the pigs and cows and horses received much more attention than the children, and about the only instrument used in bringing up children was the fist. That was how much use the “'Orthodox Church” really was to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the war and the revolution upset everything thousands of the children were left orphans and literally went wild. These Bezprizor-ni, as they were called, have been one of Russia’s great problems. The claim is made that this problem is solved, yet as late as the fall of 1929 in one city of Transcaucasia 480 of them were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These vagabond children flock to the cities in the wintertime and to the country in the summer. They go north in the summer and south in the winter and travel in packs, governed by laws and regulations of their own. They live on whatever falls into their grasp, picking pockets, and stealing valises, handbags, fruit or whatever can be seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the “'new day” that has dawned for Russia’s children there is apparently being made a sincere effort to uplift them physically and mentally, while closing to them every door that would lead them to a knowledge of God. Russia is admittedly short of the necessities of modern life: books, paper, pencils, are luxuries. Yet there is some effort to supply these, and there are kindergartens in almost every village. All over the country are posters warning parents that they have no right to beat their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio is being used to entertain the people, and to instruct them as well. Mothers are taught over the radio much that is of interest and importance in the care of their children’s bodies. There are now 476 museums in Russia, as compared ’with 30 before the revolution. And these museums are crowded most of the time. The motto or slogan which the Soviet government has provided for the children is “Learn, Learn and Learn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soviet laws forbid the employment of children up to fourteen years of age, yet in the summer of 1929 papers published in Russia, but not usually circulating outside of Russia, claimed that there were at that time more than 1,000,000 children between the ages of eight and fourteen who were working as wage-earners. Russia is a good way from being a paradise for. children, therefore, though there seems to be no reasonable question of the great effort being made to rectify and atone for the previous intolerable conditions.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Child Defectives &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">There are three million child defectives in the United States, and that is more than ten percent of all the children in the elementary schools of the country. These children are suffering from defective sight, hearing, speech, mental retardation, emotional instability, or some other handicap. And this does not include the 625,000 with weak hearts and the 6,000,000 that are undernourished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is believed essential that all these children should be given training in special classes if they are to become useful citizens. That seems like a large under taking, but-it is claimed that ferv investments of the taxpayers money have yielded as large returns as that expended in the rehabilitation of disabled adults, and-it is believed that even more can be done with, the same money expended on children. New York city provides special classes fox its 4,000 crippled children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A recent survey of children attending kindergarten in a congested section of Brooklyn disclosed that only one child out of five was free from physical ailments of some kind. In a continuation school in New York city less than one out of seven of 2,700 boys was found free from physical defects. Left-handed children are not defective, and their left-handedness should not be interfered with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is an unfortunate fact that the children who go into factory work at the earliest possible moment are the ones who are least fitted for it. It is the children of the poor whose nerves are unstrung by what they have seen and heard and experienced, not the children of the aristocrats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And if they are not defectives when they go into the factories, many children soon become so. The constant tending of machines results in nervous 'diseases, heart 'defects, tuberculosis, toxic poisoning, catarrhal affections, curvature of the spine and permanent injuries to bones and muscles. The worst effect of all. is on the child’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Manchester </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font4"> claims that in England there are at least half a million children in the elementary schools who are dull and backward, and half a million others who need medical attention before they can gain reasonable benefit from the education which the state provides.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Child Labor</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">There, are over one million children in the United States who are between „the ages of 10 and 15 and who are not in school because they have to do something to keep alive. A report gives the number in various occupations as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5,800 mine boys,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">7,500 shoe factory workers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">10,500 furniture factory workers, 12,000 clothing factory workers, 13,000 in steel mills,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">18,000 messenger boys and girls, 20,700 insurance boys, 22,500 office boys and girls, 30,000 sales boys and girls, 41,000 child servants, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">55,000 textile workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is claimed that in the city of Reading, Pa., 51 percent of all the children between 14 and 16 years of age are working for wages. This is the worst showing of any city in Pennsylvania. The evil of getting out of a child all there is in him at this tender age is that it stunts his physical and mental growth, and puts him into a blind alley job where he can never hope to make any appreciable progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New Jersey has a bad reputation for overworked children. In the northern part of the state much work is brought into the homes to escape the relatively more stringent regulations in effect in New York. In the southern part of the state thousands of Philadelphia children work on the truck farms throughout the summer months for wages that are a disgrace to even put in print. Twelve percent of these child workers on farms get less than 5c an hour when working at their best speed. Only 33 percent get over 15c an hour. In some of the Philadelphia school districts more than one-half of the pupils join in this truck farm migration early in the spring and, of these, 90 percent do not reach the normal grade in school for children of their age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The economic factor plays a large part in sending children to work at an early age. The United States Children’s Bureau studied the cases of 7,000 children engaged in street trades, newspaper selling and carrying, and street peddling, and found that in almost all cases the children came from poor families. They did these things, not because they wished to, but because they had to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stringent school attendance laws will not control child labor. If the fathers cannot earn enough to maintain the family, the boys and girls will inevitably go out to help them. New York has plenty of urchins 6 to 12 years of age who are illegally acting as bootblacks. All their work is done with one eye out for the cops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In biting words Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote of child labor many years ago:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No fledgeling feeds the father bird!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No chicken feeds the hen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No kitten mouses for the eat—■ This glory is for men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are the Wisest, Strongest Race—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Loud may our praise be sung!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The only animal alive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That lives upon its young!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Child Labor Legislation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Some time in the eighties New York and Colorado passed laws fixing the 14-year age minimum for employment of both boys and girls in manufacturing. This general rule has been extended to many of the other states, so that in 1907 there were 29 states that kept children under 14 out of the factory. This law is frequently indifferently enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York state now’ has a law’ making it illegal for a minor under 14 to be employed in. any business or service. Minors from 14 to 17, are required to receive part-time instruction in school, and those from 17 to 21 who cannot read and write English must take evening instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are still three states where there is no minimum age for work in factories except indirectly through the school laws; and five more where children may work in factories at 12 years or even younger outside of school hours. In 11. states children under 16 may still work in factories after 7 p. m., and in 12 states they may work more than eight hours a day. Most of these states are in the South.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The employment of children under the legal age is very common in canneries, and in part due to the fact that canneries were formerly exempted from compliance with the age factors of the child labor laws. In the fall of 1930 a check-up was made of 1,127 under 14 years of age found at work in canneries and it was found that 78 percent of these were under the legal working age of the states in which they were found. The cannery employees often go from state to state and may work legally in one state and illegally in another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According- to the laws of the state of New York double indemnity is awarded for minors injured while illegally employed, but sixteen of the states, including the great industrial state of Pennsylvania, exclude such minors from any compensation whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one industrial accident in Pennsylvania in which a boy under 18 was killed the employer was fined $25 and costs amounting to $10.60. In another accident in the same state, in which a boy of 15 was killed and three children of 13, 14 and 15 years were injured, the employer was fined $15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The minimum age at which children may leave school to go to work in Britain is 15. In Ecuador no child under 14 years may be employed, except that between 12 and 14 certain work may 'be done by a child who lias completed certain studies or whose parents need his assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Brazil no child under 12 may work, and between 12 and 14 only if certain school work has been finished. Every child under 18 must have a certificate of physical fitness before he may go to work at all; he may not work to exceed six hours a day, and night work is forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Congress has twice tried to enact child labor legislation, only to have its work destroyed by the Supreme Court. A child labor amendment was passed in 1924, but so far only five states have ratified it. The Roman Catholic church used its great political power’ in Massachusetts to defeat this humane piece of legislation in that state; the priests were required to openly oppose it.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Child Prodigies</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Adults are always interested in child prodigies, and every generation produces many. At the age of ten months Christian Heinicker, born &quot;&nbsp;in 1721, at Dubeek, could speak and repeat any word said to him. Within a year thereafter he knew most of the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. In his third year he was conversant with history and geography. In his fourth year he mastered French, and died from a weakened constitution the same year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mozart composed music before he was 4; Beethoven played in public when he was 8, and was publishing music at 10. Chopin played a concerto in public with distinction at the age of 9. An Alabama boy recently finished reading his toventy-seventh book at the age of 4J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally there seems to be a child with a natural bent in a mathematical direction that baffles understanding. A little Danish boy 6 years old instantly multiplies figures with products as high as 10,000, giving accurate answers in less than ten seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the age of 6 years Lorraine Jaillet, of New York, speaks and writes in French, English and Spanish; writes and directs her own dramas; composes poetry, paints, and conducts all her correspondence on a typewriter. Twenty physicians have, pronounced her as nearly physically perfect as a child may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding musical genius of today is a boy of 12, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. At twelve years of age he astonished the world with a performance in Carnegie Hall, New York, that the musicians are still talking about. Off the concert stage he is said to be a-normal child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Harold Finley, 13, has just been congratulated by the president of Northwestern University upon matriculating in that institution. It is denied that prodigies develop into inferior adults. An investigation of hundreds of cases proves that it is not correct.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark43"></a>A </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Few Educational Items</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">In England about 1,000 children of school age live on canal boats which are always on the move. The natural result is that these children get only about 20 half-days a year in school. It is proposed to rectify this matter by having traveling schools in which the teachers follow the children from, port to port. This method of teaching forester’s children in Canada has been, tried and found sueetssful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are now about 60 publishers that publish hooks and magazines for children, as against a very few only a generation ago. Columbia University is making an effort to purify ehil-dren’s literature, by cutting out fairy stories and other literature that is false and impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingsley Fairbridge maintains in Western Australia a school for poor children in which they are educated to step out of the slums of London and into the fresh air and sunshine of Australia. It is said that the output of this school provides just the kind of immigrants that Australia needs and desires, a&gt;_d that the school is a great success and has no enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two or three years ago New York city staged a novel addition to the education of its boys and girls, causing them to engage in a city-wide competition. for model airplanes with rubber bands as their sole motive power. In several instances the children developed planes that are quite different from any planes in use and that may sometime be used for full-sized planes.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Educating the Parents</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">A generation </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font4"> parents took the view that children owed them gratitude for bringing them into the world and maintaining them during infancy; and that is God’s view, the Bible view. But it is no longer popular. The present view seems to be that no matter how badly a child needs correction the parent should withhold it and look on the child as a mysterious creature that needs constant study to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is nothing so mysterious about children. If a father is disorderly his son is liable to be so too. If a mother is quick-tempered she is liable to have a daughter that has tantrums. Parents usually see in their children a composite of what they were when they were young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the idea of helping both the children and the parents there are now visiting teachers in some localities who go about visiting homes finding out what makes Johnny do the impossible things lie does in school and suggesting what the parents may do or not do to turn him into a civilized person. It is a ticklish job, but it is a good place to begin. Some parents lie to their children, and even tell them to lie to others, and then marvel that they are lied to in return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Portland (Oregon) woman, interested in the case of four boys who confessed to thefts of 40 automobiles and one attempted holdup, made the bold proposal that their parents should be prosecuted on the ground that they had neglected them; and maybe she was right at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many a father is so immersed in money-making, and many a mother is so wrapped up in her social affairs, that there is little time left for thought respecting the most important thing entrusted to them. Scolding a child now and then, or interfering often in its activities, does not give it the aid it needs for its development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today there are high school courses in parent-craft, and there should be. The children of trained parents are said to be more self-reliant, better able to make their own decisions than those of the untrained. They are said to have initiative and enterprise and to be working nearer the limit of their capacity, to be sounder in health, and to be more tolerant and courteous and unafraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today organized parent education programs are in operation in 22 states of the Union. Six universities and two schools for social work offer graduate provisional training for parent educational workers. Parents are learning that the first few’ years of a child’s life are the most important, and a study of the .spoiled child problem shows that children do not outgrow early habits as soon as parents think they will. Many of them go through life with these attitudes and then develop mental and nervous breakdowns when they find they are not equipped to meet bravely the vicissitudes and responsibilities of adult existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We conclude with a touching little skit entitled “Father to Son”, taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Blue Flame .•</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Listen, son-—I am saying this to you as you lie asleep, one little hand crumpled under your cheek and the tumbled hair stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a hot stifling wave of remorse swept over me. I could not resist it. Guiltily I came to your bedside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are things that I was thinking, son; I had been cross to you and I scolded you because you gave your face a mere dab with, the towel instead of washing<sup>-</sup> well. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when I found you had thrown some of your things on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At breakfast I found fault too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread too much jelly on your bread and it dripped on the tablecloth. And as you started off to play and I drove away for the office, you turned and waved a little hand and called, “Goodbye, Dad,” and I frowned and said in reply, ‘ ‘ Hold your shoulders back—walk straight! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And then it began all over again as I was coming home. You were over on the vacant lot at the corner, down on your knees playing marbles. I stopped the ear and some of the other boys yelled, “There’s your father! ’ ’ and some of them ducked. There were holes in your stockings and I humiliated you before the boy friends who were left by making you march home. I shouted to ■ you that stockings cost money and you should be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father! It was such stupid, silly logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you remember later, when I was reading in the library, and you came in softly, timidly, -with sort of a hurt, hunted look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated. “What is it you want?” I snapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You said nothing, but ran across the room with one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms ’round my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God has set blooming in your heart, and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">W ell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. Suddenly I saw selfishness and I felt sick at heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">M hat has habit been doing to me? The habit of complaining, of fault-finding, of reprimanding—all of these were my rewards to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected so much of youth—and you are so young, son. I &quot;was measuring you by the gauge of my own years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a feeble atonement. I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours, yet I must say what I am saying. I must burn sacrificial fires, alone, here in your bedroom, and make free confession. Tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">[Reprint of a triple-column editorial of the all-American he-editor of the Portland (Oregon) A<sup>7</sup>ews]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">T SEEMS to have been determined, by the bankrupt minds that operate the world, that the only solution for present troubles is “another war”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A new war will, it is hoped, kill off surplus labor. This is obviously the easiest means of getting rid of it, and the “best minds” will, as usual, take the easiest way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is so much easier to start a war than to apply common sense to world ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, if we are going to have another war, we might as well have some rules for it. The last was fought, as the politicians say, “ir-regardless” of rules—and it was pretty much of a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We offer, for public approval, a model set of rules: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) That the manufacturers of army raincoats be compelled to wear their own product, pay their own doctor bills when stricken with pneumonia, and defray their own funeral expenses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) That all congressmen and senators voting for war be given the choice of enlisting in the shock troops or being shot on the Capitol steps.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) That all manufacturers of war supplies bo hanged when their profits reach the million-dollar mark.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) That uplift agencies, charged with the moral welfare of the troops, be prohibited from shipping cash registers into the war zone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) That all Four-Minute speakers be shot at the completion of their first two minutes of oratory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) That all holy men who announce to their congregations that the Almighty is fighting with us be dispatched to interview Him personally on the subject and find out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) That each battleship, cruiser, destroyer and submarine shall carry, as excess baggage, one or more stockholders in battleship building concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) That the secret service be restrained from the discovery of “enemy plots” every time somebody turns on a light in the parlor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) That paper manufacturers be prohibited from entering the shoe-making trade.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) That restaurant proprietors near concentration camps be enjoined from having two menus—one for civilians and one, with higher prices, for soldiers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) That college professors be stopped from delving into history to prove that the enemy always was a low-down scoundrel, anyway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) That the cause of the war shall be clearly stated to the people as the reduction of unemployment, and' not disguised as “a holy war to save civilization”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">There are, of course, many more rules needed. But these will suffice for a starter. We suggest their adoption by luncheon clubs, sewing circles, debating societies and other cultural agencies, and their transmission, with resolutions urging their passage, to Congress.</span></p>

In her report she shows that Egypt has yet a long way to go. She said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I saw with sorrow, in several factories, the almost automatic hitting of the children with canes and whips by the overseers as they moved up and down, to spur them on in their work. It was not definitely cruel hitting or thrashing that I myself saw, but it was wanton, and was not discontinued while I was looking on. It seemed to me to be the expression of false zeal and misapplied authority, and there was some hitting of the children on the head, a really dangerous practice. The owners and managers admit that the mill runs from 5 a. m. to 8 or 9 p. m. but no one in authority seems to find it necessary to see that individual young workers, or groups of them, have any regular pause for a meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It only needs to add to this that under the Egyptian law children may go to work in factories at the age of 9, but as a matter of fact they often go at 7 and 8, and sometimes as early as 5% they are working like machines, with all expression of childhood gone from their faces.</span></p>

These concerns carry with them chain accountants, chain doctors and chain lawyers. For the past thirty years the oil trust has seldom allowed anyone to hesitate at that business. The power trust has harnessed all of this side of the globe. So what business is there left to this country for our people to thrive on? Thousands of men who a few years ago thrived moderately in business have no livelihood now. The millions of people they hired for living wages and salaries are walking the streets.

<p><span class="font5">Germs, the Modern Superstition</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">D</span><span class="font4">O YOU know that the germ theory has never been proven? And it cannot be proven, either. If it had been proven, it would not be a theory. It has been truly said that 'Unowledge without evidence is superstition”; and that applies to the germ theory also. It is a leftover superstition of a past age, when man feared that the earth was inhabited with hideous monsters that were hiding everywhere, in the air, in the sea, in the darkness, etc., always ready to jump out and devour him or make life otherwise miserable for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Noxv that we have east aside this oldtime superstition, we can laugh and say, 'How foolish our ancestors must have been to even believe such fairy tales!’ But you can rest assured that it was no laughing matter in those days;. these mental monsters were really feared by the entire civilized world and spoken of only with greatest respect. In many lands they were regarded as gods and were worshiped with great reverence, and even human sacrifices were offered up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that we have come into this enlightened age, we have discarded the hideous monster superstition for want of positive proof, but we are still just as foolish as our forefathers of old. We'have turned from the gigantic monster theory, to the germs, which are so small that we cannot hear, see, feel, smell or taste them. Yet they are just as ferocious as the monsters of old, 'lurking everywhere, ready to attack man and send him to an early grave.’ According to the inventors of this preposterous idea, the germ’s only aim in life is to make life miserable for man. But fortunately for all of us, it is only an idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the medical profession have accepted -lie theory as though it were a proven fact, probably because it is the most profitable part of their repertory. It is needless to say that it was invented by the mighty medical monopoly and that it is now exploited for all that it is Worth, by them through the serum trust, not for the benefit of the people’s health, however, but for the gain o:f selfish interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Germs do not cause disease as the most of you people have been led to believe. This theory of the cause of disease is very much misunderstood by the masses. It has been advanced by the medical profession. They realize that the average layman knows little ox* nothing about this subject. Therefore, their opinion, regarded as</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Dr. E. H. Dresden (lotva) </span><span class="font4">authority, has been accepted by the unthinking public. The medical monopoly has the public under absolute control, so that it has been considered next to a mortal sin to contradict them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many reasons to believe the germ theory false. As a matter of fact, germs are often entirely absent from the disease that they are supposed to produce. Take the Klobe-Loeffler bacilli, for instance, which are supposed to cause diphtheria; they are found in but one ease out of four. If it was the germ that caused the one case, then what caused the other three?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All germs in their normal state are harmless, and very necessary in the various processes of the body. You can compare the body to your household. If you would allow the garbage to accumulate at your back door, there would soon be a swarm of’flies there and it would become a cesspool of foul-smelling filth. You would not say that the flies caused the garbage at your back door, would you? If they did, why is it that when you remove the garbage the flies leave also ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The flies at your garbage pile are the same as the germs in your body: they are seavengfei’s. The garbage is the same as the retention of waste matter in the body, or the cause of the scavengers’ being so numerous; in other words, it is the cause of the disease. When the filth in the body has been removed, then the germs have no favorable breeding place and they are again under the control of the blood. Healthy blood is the body’s most perfect germicide for all germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we did not fill the body with a lot of junk that we call food, or take more food than the body requires, then there would not be an accumulation of waste matter in the body upon which the germs could thrive. The healthy blood would keep them under control, within the requirements of the body at all times. But if there is a lot of filth to be removed from the body, then there must be more germs to help remove it. Here is just one instance where the body acts with “supreme intelligence”, by allowing the blood to tolerate sufficient scavengers or germs to meet the demand for the work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore you can see for yourself that it is unreasonable to inoculate ourselves with, this or that serum to kill the germs, which have been harmless until the body allowed them to be cultivated, to assist it in getting rid of the filth that is accumulating and poisoning the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Killing the germs 'does not assist nature in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You are only handicapping the body by killing its scavengers. Nature needs no assistance; all it needs is to be let alone, to be given a free hand to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Germs of every kind are floating in the air all the time and are constantly entering into the body through various ways, in our breathing, eating, and drinking. One of the worst germ carriers that we have is money; it not only brings us into contact with every kind of germ known to science, but puts the germs directly into the mouth; because we handle paper money many times during the day, then we go to a lunch stand and, without ■washing the hands, eat a sandwich, germs and all. But, as I have just explained, you don’t need to fear germs; your body 'will take care of them properly, if you have been taking care of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Disease is not a something that attacks the body from the outside, nor anything that one can catch, as a good many folks believe. You say that you caught a cold, but you didn’t. Colds come from the inside of the body, and not from the outside. A draft or chill only starts them going; it stimulates the body to action. You had all the makings of the cold long before you were exposed to the draft that you are accusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cold air has a stimulating, strengthening and contracting effect upon body tissues. This stimulation arouses the body to action, and that dull feeling, that coughing and running of the nose, is caused by the body’s cleaning house, getting rid of the filth that has been carried around in the body for weeks and months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You may have noticed time and again, after being out with a number of your friends, one of them is afterwards down with a cold, while all the rest of you are ■well. You were all out together, you w<sup>T</sup>ere in the same places and in the same drafts together, yet it w<sup>T</sup>as only the one of you that got the cold. That would indicate that it is not the draft nor the benevolent germ that is at fault, but that it is the condition of the body. That brings us back to where we started, and shows that it is your own fault, because you alone are responsible for the condition of your body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a funny thing about a draft. In the summertime we call it a breeze and we welcome it. We will go out of our way to find one, or will spend lots of money for electric fans to make a breeze for us, but in the wintertime we call that same breeze a draft and we shun it, for fear that we will catch a cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a matter of fact, this fear of the air in the winter causes many a person’s cold, but not as you might think, not because of anything that they ‘caught’. Through fear of the air they don’t use enough of it, they breathe less air than the body requires to burn up the food they eat, and at the same time they are eating much heavier food. The result is that the unburned food decays and forms toxic poisons that are absorbed by the blood, to be carried through the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When more has been accumulated than can be carried by the blood stream, it is stored where the least resistance is offered until the body can find more time to eliminate the waste. The parts of least resistance are always attacked first. These are the mucous membranes of such organs as the nose, throat, lungs, bow<sup>T</sup>els, urinary canal, etc.; also diseased or inflamed tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have an open sore, it may settle there and keep the sore from healing as long as this poisoned condition exists. Or it may settle in some weak, overworked organ. This organ or the sore, or wherever this waste material settles, will now become a favorable breeding place for the germs that are ahvays present in the body, and may eventually cause suffering; by this it is possible to make a diagnosis. So you can see that these once harmless germs, when given a favorable medium to thrive upon, are now capable of inciting disease that is already in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take the sore as an example. The germs are not keeping the sore from healing, they are only feeding on the dead tissues and cells that must be removed before the sore can heal. Germs do not attack healthy tissues in the body: they only remove the waste; they are only doing the work for which they were created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a known fact, which was first brought out during the Civil War, and again during the World War, that in many cases where wmunded soldiers were left lying on the battlefield for days, without even first aid treatment, and their wounds became infected with germs and maggots, they recovered more quickly than those igyho had the best medical treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chronic bone diseases (osteomyelitis or nee-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">rosis) that have baffled the best medical minds in the world for many years, patients who have been mutilated by one operation after another to remove the decayed part of the bone, always without any permanent relief, have been completely cured in less than six weeks. The wound healed up permanently without the use of any antiseptics whatever; no drainage tubes were used. The germs and maggots did the work that all the science of medicine was unable to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These facts alone go to show that germs are benevolent creatures and that the fear of them has no foundation. There are many other cases that contradict the germ theory, but they are too well known and need not be repeated in de-</span></p>

Then there is Dr. John B. Fraser, the Canadian germ theorist and experimenter. There are many others, all with like results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They all proved that the germs are not the spreaders of disease, not the dangerous creatures that the masses have been led to believe they were. It isn’t the germ that needs so much watching: it’s your knife and fork that you must keep an eye on. Your knife and fork can give you more diseases than all’ the germs put together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In the newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Science et Industrie,</span><span class="font4"> of Paris, No. 175, there is an article about filtration and sterilization of drinking water which announces the new method of the engineer Enry Chabal, which excludes a'tain, chlorine, javeliza-tion and verdunization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chabal’s method of filtration not only clarifies the water, but sterilizes it also, due exclusively to the action of the oxygen, light, and a vital concurrence promoted in the water by biologic phenomenon during the time of filtration, without using alum, chlorine or other poisonous substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’All the hygienists in France endorse Chabal’s method, saying that water which contains alum and chlorine is not a natural water for drinking purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his process the chemical, physical and bacteriological purification of water is simplified in one process, mainly oxidation in a prolonged contact with the air, and some biological phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is glad tidings for us, because there is now no excuse to use poisonous substances in aqueducts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This must be made known to the American people through your interesting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There is a surprising number of people who realize this, yet hesitate to avow it because of the powerful interests that would be aroused in opposition and the “disturbance to business” which they fear would follow. Disturbance there would undoubtedly be, but it may be doubted if it would be much if any greater than the disturbances we now suffer periodically. Moreover, it would be the final disturbance. With the world’s earnings and income equitably distribute there need be no fear of further crises arising from “overproduction” or “underconsumption”, and. moreover, the fear that civilization may be overthrown by an eruption of war or Bolshevism would evaporate also. When we recall that no true reform has ever damaged any proper and honest interest, but on the contrary has benefited them all, it is clear that all the world would be better off if all our economic maladjustments were adjusted to the requirements of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is a nice way of telling Big Business that -it has been and is dishonest. And that is the truth, and everybody knows it; so why hesitate to tell it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Confession </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By a Subscriber</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N THE early part of the present century, a company was organized for the purpose of manufacturing tooth paste and other toilet articles, such as tooth brushes, tooth powders, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brushing of teeth at that time was usually done by only those of the laity who had artificial dentures (false teeth). It was a rare thing indeed for a youngster under twenty years of age to own a tooth brush, and a rare occurrence that he ever used it. Often children’s teeth were neglected by the parents, who apparently did not know that the “six year” molars came in back of all the “first” teeth. These teeth would decay, which often caused their loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this fact the leaders of the organization above referred to conceived the idea that tooth brushes, pastes and powders could be sold in great quantities, if we could just convince the parents that all their children’s teeth should be brushed about three or four times a day. It even w’as hinted that probably many grown-ups w’ould catch the “disease” and w’ould also buy some of our powder and paste; probably some of the tooth brushes also. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How to bring in larger dividends to our stockholders was the paramount issue, and the line of action decided upon w<sup>y</sup>as to have our agents attempt to interest school boards throughout the country, to place dentists in schools to make examination of the pupil’s teeth and incidentally to recommend our tooth products. This scheme utterly failed. Not a school hoard “fell for it”. This attempt upon our part brought out several interesting features. Wide publicity in newspapers w<sup>7</sup>as given to a discussion. of the subject and the dentists themselves w<sup>r</sup>ere “much interested in knowing who or which one should have the “privilege” of meeting all the pupils. This apparently gave an undue advantage to the lucky one W’ho would succeed in getting the appointment for the w<sup>7</sup>ork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This wms new<sup>7</sup> business for school authorities, and great diplomacy had to be exercised by our general agents in conducting the campaign throughout the country. After much effort and money spent on our part, school boards were induced to consent to have the appointed dentists make the examinations and recommendations, but not in any case w<sup>r</sup>ere school funds appropriated to pay for this w’ork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our only hope was to just “keep up the work” long enough and the habit would become established, at which time the school boards would be compelled by popular demand to do our advertising free. This is now<sup>7</sup> being done to an extent never dreamed of, even by our worthy president of the company. Even the dentists are now being paid from the public treasury, in some cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Usually the dental organization was visited in each city for the purpose of selecting a dentist or dentists, who would be properly instructed along certain lines; for instance, he was not to ask any of the children examined to call at his office; he w’as not to recommend any particular dentist to do the work necessary to be done; he w<sup>7</sup>as not to do any w’ork at the school for w’hich he received compensation; he was to fill out a chart or card (furnished free) showing what the pupil needed along dental lines, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our previous experience taught us that no particular goods should be recommended. These various requirements w<sup>r</sup>ere necessary to safeguard the financial interests of all the members of the. dental association. The nonethical as well as the ethical dentist profited by the card system w’hich the examiner used for the children: they all received packages of our goods free of charge; so even the parents who brought the children for dental service would be instructed as to w’hat preparations to buy. Usually men w’ere selected for the school w’ork w’ho were not very busy an*d could conveniently spare so many allotted hours a w<sup>7</sup>eek to this new<sup>7</sup> “stunt”. In order to have this properly done without much cost, the “rotating” rule w<sup>r</sup>as instituted. This w<sup>7</sup>ould mean that each dentist desiring to do so would take his turn at the school in making examinations and recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When this w<sup>7</sup>ork became general throughout the country, much time w<sup>7</sup>as spent and undoubtedly much good W’as accomplished, but a tremendous amount of evil also was done. A tooth brush drill w’as made a part of each day’s program of the child’s work. He is given proper credit in his W’ork if he show’s that he has a tooth brush and uses it vigorously three or four times a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The writer believes that the pendulum has swmng clear to the opposite side, and lives in the hope that it will soon start back and will stop at some point where common sense should prevail. It is almost “heresy” today to make or to offer to make any suggestions to school authorities along dental lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When another one of the little children is brought to my office by his parents, with most of his gums brushed away from his teeth or has pyorrhea definitely established in his jaws at the usual age of thirteen years, I feel that we should ask the parent some questions, although the parent is not to blame for the condition of his child’s mouth or the vile use of a tooth brush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first ciuestion I always ask the child is, “Do you like to see a good picture show?” “Yes.” “Do you always use some good eye lotion with a stiff brush, to clean your eyes after seeing the show?” “No.” “Do you like to hear the beautiful music over the radio?” “Yes.” “Do you use an ear powder with a stiff brush on your ears after hearing the music?” “No!” “What would you expect to happen to your eyes or ears, or even the skin on the back of'-your hands, if you .treated these parts of your body as you do your teeth and gums ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point the parent usually jumps into the conversation with a “holy horror expression”, “Why, Doctor! don’t you believe in children’s brushing their teeth?” “Surely I do, when they are ill or need medical attention; otherwise, not. until they are at least fifteen years of age, not before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this time the parent lias partially recovered his composure and I venture to ask if they have a fine cat, or if they own a dog- that they are proud of, and if so, do they see that the cat or dog has its teeth vigorously brushed after each meal or oftener? If this would be done to the dog as is now’ being practiced upon our youngsters, it also would have the diseases of the mouth, now common to our children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do we think more of our dogs than we do of our children ? NO! We have been taught these things, and parents accept them wholly as the correct procedure of that which is taught in our schools. It is the earnest hope of the writer that parents will think and soon demand that the evil, done to our children by the use of the tooth brush, and the tooth brush drills .or brigades, SHALL STOP. And that my dividends will become smaller and smaller, until they reach a normal amount.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Renovated Fable </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font4">NCE upon a time there was a man who had a goose that laid eggs of pure gold. Every day this goose laid one egg. But the man decided that the eggs were coming too slowly, and he wanted to get them all at once; so he killed the goose—I just remembered that is another guy’s story and is probably copyrighted. Well, it wasn’t a goose, anyway. It was a nice little factory, and the man built machinery to weave cloth and had a nice little business selling looms and parts for repairing those already sold. But he thought that if he could sell more looms he could make more money; so he built a loom that would weave more cloth and was 'more automatic’, and found that a weaver could run more looms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then a mill bought the new looms and found that it could make lots of cloth cheaper than other mills could make the same kind of cloth, with less help. So the cloth was made and sold</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Wm. T. Knight (Massachusetts)</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">at a lower price. And the other mill did the same; and others followed along, each laying-off some of the help, until now<sup>7</sup> there is no need to keep the mills running all the time, for there would be so much cloth that the people could not use it all, and, anyway, lots of the people are not working and have no money with which to buy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In other words, there is no market; for in the final end the working people are the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I just discovered that I forgot to give the man’s name. It is Industry, and he is a very sick man; and there is not much hope, for it is rather hard to make a bad little boy take castor oil. It takes a big, strong man to do it, and Industry is a real big 'bad little boy’, and at present there is no man big enough to make him take it. Anyway, I said at first that the goose is dead; and my experience with dead things is that—well—they stay dead.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Federal Council Associates</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America has a circular letter out, at least one of which went to a wealthy Jew, telling how one can become an “Associate” in the work they are doing, and naming six kinds of saints that they are willing to recognize, together with the titles of such, all based upon the amount of coin of the realm such associate is willing to give up for the privilege of being listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one coughs up $5 or less a year he is just a plain “Associate”, but if he goes over the $5 mark and falls short of the $25 mark he is a “Contributing Associate”. Suppose now a man has been so foolish one year as to make it just an even $5 bill. He goes down in history merely as an “Associate” of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America for that year. But if he loosens up and lets go of $6 he gets something for his money. And what a dignified look that has, “Contributing Associate.” Few’ Jews will go higher than $5 when they find they get nothing more up to $24. Why ’would any Jew throw away $19 a year? You would have to show him, and it would be a hard show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But at $25, and from there up to $99 a year, one makes another surge upward in the quest for titles. At $25 he becomes a “Sustaining Associate”, and anybody can see that it is much more dignified to be called a “Sustaining Associate” than to be a “Contributing Associate”. If one is merely contributing to a thing he might be contributing merely because he was bluffed into it. But- not so with a “Sustaining Associate”. Here is somebody who helps to carry the load of clerk hire, paper, envelopes, printing, etc., which is such an important part of the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not until one gets to $100 a year that the height of what might be called 'annual titles’ is reached. At that.dizzy height one becomes a “Benefactor Associate”. This is really something worth while, for a “Benefactor” is not only an “Associate”, a “Contributing Associate” and a “Sustaining Associate”; he is more: he helps to pay what the others do not pay, and what they cannot be coaxed to pay. He is like a revolving beacon to an airman that is lost in the fog. And the Federal Council is all that, and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is too late now to be a “Charter Associate”. To get that title you had to come across with your contribution during the year 1930, at the beginning of which year the Federal Council was twenty-one years old. But there is another title still to be had. This last and highest and most supreme of ‘Associate’ titles comes to the man who digs down enough to become what is called a “Life Associate”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point the circular letter withholds vital information. All that can safely be said is.that not $5, not $6 to $24, not $25 to $99, and not even $100, will get you into saints of that class. The circular just says, warily, “One who endows a department, a worker, or some phase of Federal Council work (sums required will be furnished on request).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One can almost imagine a wealthy Jew pondering this last offer of titles. The first thing he will wish to know is “Vot haf you got?” It will be necessary to show the Avhole line and quote prices. There will be haggling over the price, and much shrugging of shoulders and waving of hands to and fro. Then comes up the question of discount for cash, or other terms of payment. And finally the blunt offer, “I gifs you so much; take it or leave it.” And the Federal Council takes it, and is glad to get it. And the purchaser gets his title of “Life Associate”, which probably carries with it his ‘Diploma’ to that effect, and the only thing he will ever get in return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">U</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">nited States Senator Shipstead struck the nail on the head when in writing about the cause of hard times he said in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Magazine of Wall Street:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not enough of the gross income of the corporations goes back into immediate and broadly distributed individual income. In other words, the potential buyers are not adequately provided with the means of buying. When the gross amount paid out in wages decreases as the volume of the product increases, an impasse is sure to come. It has been recently shown, contrary to what we have all thought, that labor is receiving a smaller* proportion of the value it assists in creating than it did 90 years ago. The corporations are accumulating too much capital from profits and unwisely holding back dividend disbursements. Eich men and corporations tend to withdraw a greater part of their income from the consumptive use than do average individuals.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark155"></a>Who Is Jehovah?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">An address by Judge Rutherford </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">K</span><span class="font4">NOWLEDGE of and concerning Jehovah is of paramount importance to all creatures. The proper study of mankind, therefore, is Jehovah and His works. In general the people are ignorant concerning Him. That ignorance is not confined to the illiterate. The most learned men of the world and who are fully versed in the literature and science of the world are totally ignorant concerning Jehovah God. If the people understood and appreciated the importance to themselves of a knowledge of Him there would doubtless be a tremendous effort put forth to acquire that knowledge. The purpose of this effort is to aid the people to a better understanding of Jehovah and His works and of men’s relation thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why is there so small a number of people who know Jehovah? The great dearth of knowledge is due to the fact that man’s worst enemy has subtly and deceitfully blinded the people to the truth. Not even this can be understood until something is known of Jehovah, who He is, and of who is the enemy that possesses and keeps the people in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah reveals himself by His Word and His ■works. He reveals himself under various names, each one of which has a deep significance. The works of Jehovah that are visible to the human eye call forth adoration and praise of the reverential creature. The works of Jehovah that are invisible to the .human eye are discerned by the reverential student of His Word. Both the invisible and the visible bespeak the wisdom, power, majesty and glory of the great King eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible is the Word of God. Its contents are proof conclusive that it does not come from man, but that its origin is divine. It is reasonable, logical and consistent with itself, and it is true. It will be conceded by all that no human creature can with certainty state exactly what will come to pass centuries in the future. The Bible is the only book in which the history of the human race was written long before the events came to pass. For this reason we say the Bible contains prophecy. There are many prophecies set forth in it, but that which relates to Jesus alone is conclusive proof that the Bible is the Word of God, and not the word and work of man. That prophecy relating to Jesus is here mentioned for the purpose of authentically establishing the fact that God caused it to be WTitten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The histories of the 'world, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles, state that about nineteen, hundred years ago there lived on earth a man of unusual ability and wisdom; that he was a great teacher; that he was persecuted, tried, and put to death, by crucifixion upon a cross of wood and that the claim was made for him that he was the King of the Jews and that he died in Jerusalem. These things and much more were foretold in the Bible long centuries before Jesus came to earth, and the conceded facts disclose the clear harmony between the Scriptures and ■what came to pass. Moses wrote that God would send a man into the -world who would save the people. (Dent. 18:15, 18) Another prophet named the town in which the Savior would be born. (Mic. 5:2) Still another prophesied that he would be born a Jew and that he would be rejected by his own people and despised and persecuted and put to death. Another foretold that he -would ride into Jerusalem on an ass and offer himself as King and be joyfully received before his death. Another prophesied that he would die a violent death but not for his own wrongdoing and that not a bone of his body would be broken. (Isa. 53: 8-12; Dan. 9: 26; Ps. 34:20) Still another prophet foretold that he would be raised up out of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Centuries after these prophecies were -written Jesus came to earth and fulfilled all of them. This alone is sufficient to establish the fact that the Bible was not ■written by man. There is an abundance of corroborative proof, however, which time will not permit me to submit now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the Bible is God’s Word, then it must be true and it must be taken as authority for matters mentioned therein. Having a sure and correct record, then, by the Word or Record of Jehovah God we can prove all things concerning His creature man, what is his course and what is his destiny. Every known means has been employed in an effort to destroy the Bible and rid the earth of it, and all of these have failed because its great Author safeguarded it. Who, then, wrote the Bible? The answer is: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy [spirit].” (2 Pet. 1:21) &quot;The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.”—2 Sam. 23: 2.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">no</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The spirit of Jehovah is His power invisible to man and which He causes to operate upon the m</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font4">d of man. The Scriptural proof, therefore, is that the spirit or invisible power of Jehovah operated directing men who were devoted to Him to vrrite down the things that God desired to be kept of record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reverential man who takes serious notice of the marvels of the earth knows that some power greater than man created the earth and all that is therein. When lie looks at the planets and the millions of stars that appear beyond the earth, and learns that each one of these moves on in its own fixed orbit, he knows that wisdom and power beyond the understanding of man put them there. One of Jehovah’s prophets was moved to write ivith reference to the visible creation, in Psalm 19:1, 2: “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.” On another occasion the prophet wrote (Ps. 104: 24, 25): “0 Lord, how manifold. are thy w'orks! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.” Who, then, is the Creator of these marvelous things? The Bible answers fully and completely, and. that answer is true. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is the great First Cause, and He reveals himself under various names, each one carrying a peculiar meaning. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font4"> is the name by which the Bible first reveals the Mighty One. That name applies to Him specifically as the great Creator of heaven and earth and the fulness thereof. He is thus designated as the responsible One, the Supreme One, and He who is the source of all life and the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Almighty God</span><span class="font4"> is the name by which He revealed himself unto Abraham, who previously had knorvn Him only as God. Abraham had been called and God was about to make a covenant with him and He revealed himself by the name </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Almighty,</span><span class="font4"> thereby strengthening Abraham’s faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham and his wife had no children and they were both beyond the age of begetting children. God made a promise to Abraham that he should be the father of a great nation and that He would multiply his seed as the stars for multitude. It seemed impossible to a man like Abraham that such a promise could be fulfilled. And then God said to him, in substance (Gen. 17:1-5): 'Abraham, even though you are an aged man and your wife is past the age of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">child</span><span class="font4">bearing, yet I will make you the father of many nations; and as a guarantee, my name is Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou perfect.’ The title “Almighty God” means that there is no limitation to His power. His name was therefore a guarantee and a full assurance to Abraham that what He had promised the Almighty would carry out. The Scriptural proof is that such was the effect upon Abraham, because it is written: “He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he Avas able also to perform.”—Rom. 4: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later the Eternal One revealed himself by the name </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font4"> Translators of the Bible render this title &quot;Self-existing Ono”. It is true that it means that; but it means much more. The people of Jehovah were domiciled in Egypt suffering persecution. God called Moses and sent him there to act as the visible deliverer, and to Moses He revealed himself by the name Jehovah. That name signifies His purpose toward His creatures. Prioi’ to that time He had not been known by the name Jehovah. To signify the meaning of it God said to Moses (Ex. 6:3): “And I appeared unto .Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.” Then God told Moses the purpose of sending him to Egypt and directed him to deliver a message to the Israelites and to say to them: T am JEHOVAH, and I will bring you from the borders of Egypt; I will rid you out of bondage; I will redeem you with an outstretched arm; I will take you unto me as my people; and I will be to you a God, and I will bring you into the land which I sware to give unto Abraham.’ He thus emphasizes the significant importance of the name Jehovah, and that its meaning is His purpose concerning His creatures. Wherever the name Jehovah is disclosed by the Scriptures it means His purpose to carry out that which is expressed and that nothing can prevent Him from so doing. Men make plans and then attempt to carry them out. Jehovah does not make a plan or plans, because such is wholly unnecessary with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Him. The term </span><span class="font4">“divine plan” often used in speech is wholly unsupported by the Scriptures and is not founded in reason. There being no limitation to the power of Jehovah, a plan with Him is wholly unnecessary. He lias but to purpose a thing and it shall be done. Once His word is given it must be carried out. Concerning this it is written: “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. 46: .11) It is the purpose of Jehovah, long ago expressed, that in His own due time He would complete a new creation, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and that such new creation He would use as His instrument to enlighten the peoples of earth concerning the truth. By His prophet He therefore says (Isa. 42:5, 6): “Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He having expressed His purpose by His word, that w-ord cannot return unto Him without the result’s being accomplished. By His prophet He says (Isa. 55:11): “My word . . . that goeth forth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that &quot;which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He reveals himself by the name and title </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Most High,</span><span class="font4"> which name signifies His relationship to all creation. That title applies to Him as the Supreme Ruler over all powers and principalities. In Him reside all power and authority. Anything and everything- that is held in possession by any creature is from the Most High and subject to His sovereign will. The name “Most High” bespeaks His supremacy over all as the One to whom all governments and powers, visible and invisible, must be subject. All power possessed or exercised by creatures is power that is delegated by Jehovah or that &quot;which is exercised by His permission. Because He is supreme the prophet speaks of Him (Jer. 10:10): “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah alone possessed immortality from the beginning. Immortality means that which cannot die. He is the Self-existing One, possessing- life within himself. Concerning this, Jesus said (John 5:26): “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” Furthermore, it is written (1 Tim. 6:15, 16): “[He is] the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see, to whom be honour and power everlasting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was a time when God was alone. The beginning of His creation was the Logos, who is also called Jesus Christ, His beloved One. Many have been led into the error that God and Jesus are one and the same Being. The following words accredited to Jesus in Proverbs 8:22-25 are conclusive proof that there is but one Jehovah God and that Jesus Christ is His beloved Son: “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with -water. Before the mountains &quot;were settled, before the hills was I brought forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Logos, which is the Christ the Son of God, has ahvays been faithful and true to Jehovah. He was made the Redeemer of man; was and now is and forever will be the great executive officer of Jehovah to carry out His purposes, and Jehovah has exalted Him and given Him a name above all names and commanded that every creature shall bow the knee to His 'beloved Son. Jehovah., being the source of life by and through Christ Jesus, gives life to those creatures who obey and remain in harmony with Him; and for this reason it is written (Eph. 1:10) that in the fulness of time God &quot;will gather together in Christ all things, both those which are in heaven and those on the earth. For this reason Jesus said (John 17:3): “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>Ignorance</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">If Jehovah is what the Scriptures claim for Him, why is there so much ignorance concerning Him? and why are there so few people who speak of His great name ? There is one primary reason for such ignorance, and there are other contributing reasons. The primary reason is that Satan, the Devil, by his deceptive pow-er and influence, blinds the people; and the contributing reasons are a failure and refusal to accept the Bible as God’s 'Word of truth and a failure of those who pretend to teach the Bible to teach it in fact. God’s clear promise, however, is that in His own due time all creation shall be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth. That time is now beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;When Moses and Aaron went before the king of Egypt with a message from Jehovah demanding the release of God’s chosen people, that haughty potentate replied: ‘Who is Jehovah, that I should obey him ?’ The Egyptian king was ■ the representative of Satan, and is used in the Scriptures to foreshadow Satan and his organization. Some of the distinguished legal lights of America have recently said: “Who is Jehovah, that we should heed him?” The theological schools, universities and -seminari.es that claim to educate the young men to fill the pulpits of the churches today openly state that they 'do not believe there is a God. Let the people judge whom such men represent and whose servants they are. They could not be the servants of God, even though claiming thus to be. Concerning such it is written (Ps. 53:1, 4): “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity. . . . Have the -workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jehovah laid the foundation of the earth preparatory as a home for man He assembled the hosts of heaven, among -whom were the Logos and Lucifer. Those two are designated in the Scriptures as the “morning stars”, and it is recorded that they sang an anthem together to the praise of the Eternal One and that all the hosts of heaven joined in and shouted the praise of Jehovah for joy. Seeing the worship given to the great Creator by His millions of creatures, Lucifer coveted that honor for himself. Of him it is written in the prophecy (Isa. 14:13, 14) that he said: T will be like the Most High; I will ascend above these other stars of God’s creation.’ To accomplish his lawless purpose he resorted to fraud, lying, deception and murder. God caused His prophet (Ezekiel 28:1318) to write concerning Lucifer these words: T have set thee in Eden; thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation until lawlessness was found in thee. Thy heart was lifted, up because of thy beauty. Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. Thou hast defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities.’ Then Jehovah changed Lucifer’s name, and ever after he was and is known as Satan, Dragon, Serpent and Devil. From then till now that wicked one has resorted to all manner of deceptions to turn the people away from the true God and keep them in ignorance of Him. Concerning Satan it is written that he is ‘the god of this world and blinds the minds of men lest the truth should shine unto them’. (2 Cor. 4:3, 4) When Jesus was on earth His speech was chiefly that of instruction and honor to Jehovah God, and He said of Satan that he is the prince or invisible ruler of this wicked world, that he is against God, and that he is the father of lies and a murderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The policy of Satan is to use any means necessary to turn men away from Jehovah. One of his methods is to induce and encourage men to worship heroes. The Bible discloses that lie began this with Nimrod, the founder of the first nation, of whom it is written that ‘Nimrod was a mighty hunter preferred before Jehovah’. The history of every nation that has been on earth shows that the people have worshiped men and set them up as great before them. The nations called “Christian” are no exception. Christianity was organized with a pure motive, declaring its loyalty to God and to Christ Jesus, but soon fell into the trap of Satan and set men up before it as heroes and honored them and deified some of them. Today in every land the name of creatures is exalted and the name of Jehovah pushed aside, and Satan is the real cause for this.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>The Issue</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible plainly sets forth the purpose of Jehovah, which briefly stated is this: That, following the disobedience of man that brought death upon the race, Jehovah promised to redeem man from death and this He would do by the perfect sacrifice of a perfect man; that He would send, and He did send, Jesus Christ His beloved Son, who became a man for that purpose and died upon, the cross, and God raised Him up out of death and exalted Him to heaven and made Him His Executive Officer; that when Jesus ascended into heaven Jehovah directed that He must make no effort to overthrow Satan until Jehovah’s due time. Jehovah further expressed His purpose to set up a kingdom, with Christ Jesus as the Head of that kingdom, through which all the families of the earth should be offered a full opportunity for knowledge and life everlasting. During the past nineteen centuries Jehovah has been preparing those who are to be associated with Christ in that kingdom, and this work is now about done. God further expressed His purpose, in His Word, that He will destroy Satan and his organization and establish righteousness on earth. Just before doing so God declares His purpose to have a witness given to the peoples of earth that He is God in order that all who may desire may take their stand on the side of Jehovah. For this reason He gives commandment to the followers of Jesus, saying: ‘I have put my words in thy mouth and covered thee with the shadow of mine hand, while I plant the heavens and lay the foundation of the earth. Ye therefore are my witnesses that I am God.’ That is the reason why today the few people on earth who are really devoted to God are preaching the good news of God’s purpose to establish His kingdom and telling the people that Jehovah is the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jehovah chose the Israelites as His people He gave them the law (Ex. 20:3): “Thou shaft have no other gods before me.” That He did for the protection of the Israelites from the influence of Satan. The kingdom of Israel foreshadowed the kingdom of God, and those who shall come into harmony with Him; and these are to have no other God besides Jehovah. The issue now is, Who is God? and whom will ye serve? For the benefit of the creature, God causes announcement to be made, that He is God; that He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and that He is the Giver of every good and perfect gift; that He is the source of life, and that none can have life except by and through the way He has prepared. This He does for the vindication of Ills name and to open the way for all men who will obey Him to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites under King- Ahab fell to the blandishments of Satan, and worshiped Baal, which is another name for the Devil. Elijah, God’s faithful servant and prophet, challenged the four hundred priests of Baal to a test by fire from heaven to prove whether Baal or Jehovah is God. The test was on, and the pleading of Baal’s priests availed them nothing, and they failed. Then Elijah the prophet, in the presence of the people, prayed thus: ‘Jehovah of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God. . . . Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Jehovah God, and that thou hast turned their hearts back again. Then the fire of the Lord, fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice. . . . And when the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and said, Jehovah, he is the God! Jehovah, he is the God!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today professed Christianity, under the leadership of the clergy, makes a pretense of believing and serving God. In the language of His prophets, ‘they draw near unto Him with their mouths, but their hearts are turned faraway from Him.’ They are induced thus to do by the teaching of their professors and clergymen; and whence the invisible influence comes must be apparent to all, namely, from God’s enemy. The time is at hand when another great test is before mankind, and in this test God will manifest His name before all creation. He has declared it shall be done by fire from heaven in the worst trouble ever known. But before so doing He is causing notice to be served upon the nations that He is God and affording them the opportunity to gain this knowledge and take their stand on. His side. The people must determine foi' themselves whether they -will longer heed and obey the speech of leaders who deny Jehovah God and deny the Bible as His 'Word of truth, who deny the blood of Jesus as the redemptive price for man, and the kingdom of God as the means of restoring and cleaning up the world. The test is at hand! Choose ye this day whom ye will serve! If Jehovah is God, then serve Him and learn the way to life everlasting. Give Him the honor that is due H.is holy name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Canada Still Uses Hash</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font4">ANADA still uses the lash, and is to that extent tied up to the medieval ages. An 18-year-old boy in Winnipeg has just been given five lashes for his part in stealing ten dollars. This has aroused, all Winnipeg, and 1,100 citizens have met and demanded that this relic of barbarism be dropped from Canadian law. At least, say they, if it is to be applied against 18-year-old boys, let it also be applied against stockbrokers who have robbed the people, not of ten-dollar bills, but of thousands of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Birds Dodged the Alumimim </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Lucy Templeton (Tennessee)' </span><span class="font3">[Reprinted from the Knoxville </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4"> HEARD a terrific scuffling around under the persimmon tree and knew that there was a chewink somewhere about, for they can make as much noise with one dry leaf as an old hen scratching for a brood of chickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sure enough, lie presently appeared, jumping up and down and scratching with both feet. In the tree over his head a catbird was complaining of the heat, and in the crepe myrtle bush just outside my window a redbird was flitting about, uttering the tuneless “chip-chip” that AVilson says sounds like two pebbles struck together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I thought how much they must be suffering from the heat, especially since the drought has dried up so many of their pools and drinking places. No puddles in the road, no tiny drink in a cupped dried leaf in the wood. So I decided to supplement the bowlful of water on the other side of the house with another that I could watch from my window.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I went to the pantry, rejected a white enamel bowl as too glaring and finally selected a shallow’ pan of aluminum as more like the silver color of water itself, filled it with cold water, placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">it underneath the tree and shut Boots up in the house so she could not disturb the visitors to the Spa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I then brought my work to the window/, possessed with that unreasoning feeling of benevolence that so often fills one who has done a good deed to gratify himself, and prepared to watch the birds avail themselves of my bounty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you know that not one of those ungrateful little wretches ever came near my pan? It has been out there four hours and not a single bird citizen has patronized the municipal swimming pool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And I had intended to write a piece about it’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(From the same -pen, later.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some unknown friend has sent me a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> published at Brooklyn, marked at an article on “Aluminum Poisoning” -with a reference to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Outdoors</span><span class="font4"> of last week wherein I mentioned having put out an aluminum pan full of water for the use of the birds which was not patronized. The inference is that the birds do not approve of aluminum ware.</span></p>

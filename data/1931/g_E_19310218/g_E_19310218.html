<p><span class="font11">The Handicap of <sup>a</sup>Tlie Sunshine City”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font8">F ALL places that have been favored by the Lord with an ideal location for a home the year around, probably nothing could exceed the beautiful peninsula, Pinellas County, Florida, which juts down into Tampa Bay, one of the finest harbors in the world, and upon which stand the lovely city of St. Petersburg and the village of Clearwater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In respect to its climate, St. Petersburg is as fortunately situated as it is with respect to its splendid frontage of Tampa Bay on one side and the deep blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico on the other. The peninsula is long enough and ■wide enough to provide all-the-year-around homes for a million people without crowding one another at all, and only some great error of judgment, some trespassing upon the rights and liberties of the people, could prevent St. Petersburg from being a rival of Los Angeles or of the Wonder City of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A little below the 28th parallel of north latitude, the climate is subtropical; but on account of the trade winds which blow steadily across it, climatic conditions are almost as perfect as in San Diego, the city of eternal spring. As in San Diego, the growing season extends throughout the entire year and sunshine is eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, recently, something of great importance has happened to retard the development of St. Petersburg as a desirable permanent home for those who are tired of wintry storms and the baking heat of less favored climes. This is not the fault of the climate, although, oddly enough, even the climate itself protested against the unwisdom and injustice of the extraordinary phenomenon brought to the attention of our readers in the following paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Has Learned Setter</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Subscription Department tells us that we have four subscribers in the Fiji Islands. There, a hundred years or so ago, it was quite a common thing for a man to divide his mother-in-law amongst his friends and to enjoy eating her for the evening meal. These subscribers, who are now entirely “civilized”, will be astonished that they now<sup>T</sup> have rights and privileges which some would vainly attempt to withhold from the highly intelligent citizens of St. Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have eighteen subscribers in the Hawaiian Islands, where, not so long ago, young men and women were encouraged to throw themselves into Kilauea’s boiling crater to prevent its lava from pouring forth upon the fields and villages below. These Hawaiian subscribers now wonder if such things were ever possible; and they will wonder still more when they hear about what has been undertaken in St. Petersburg in the last few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have forty-three subscribers in Alaska, where the natives, only a few years ago, undertook to eat some of the explorers who were wrecked upon their shores. .Alaska is more civilized now. It would not undertake to eat explorers now. It has learned to extend a little more liberty of movement and thought to its visitors and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the opposite end of the world, in Tasmania, we have forty-six subscribers; and in New Zealand, 218. Here, only a little while ago, the tattooed and savage Maoris brandished their spears and sought in vain to guard themselves with their bullhide shields against the onrush, of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And so we could go on and on around the world, touching here and there what have been its dark spots, only to find that old prejudices and customs have given way and are giving way and the light of the new day is breaking. And this brings us back to the strange occurrence at St. Petersburg in the latter part of December, 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">210 Varieties of Clergymen</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is admitted that in the United States today we have 210 kinds of clergymen. At this point it is perhaps well to let some of their own spokesmen say just what they have accomplished and are accomplishing in the way of establishing in the earth the ideal conditions for which Jesus taught us to pray in the petition which embodies the expression, “Thy will Ire done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">323 &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Gypsy Smith, the evangelist, is highly esteemed by the clergy and has been used by them in campaigns all over the earth. Quite likely he has at some time been, thus used by the clergy of St. Petersburg to help them to do what they esteem to be their duty to do, namely, uphold the 210 denominations which, collectively, Mr. Smith considers to be the church. Well, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Delineator</span><span class="font8"> Mr. Smith said, in substance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ehureh has education, art, music, position and money, but we have lost hold upon the common people, lost hold upon the coming generation, lost hold on God. I know churches in which nothing could he done even if Christ himself would preach to them; he would not even be welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Charles M. Sheldon, author of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">In His Steps, </span><span class="font8">and editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Herald,</span><span class="font8"> is another gentleman with unusual opportunities to know what has been accomplished, and in the March (1930) issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Herald</span><span class="font8"> he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Say what we may of activities in the church programs, and brag as loud as we often do about church doings, it is a fact that at no time in the history of the church, was it ever so empty of spiritual life. The prayer meetings in the churches would be a joke if they were not a tragedy. In churches of over one thousand members it is rare for fifty members to be found in the prayer service. I have questioned hundreds of ministers in conference meetings with them, and giving frank and honest answers to my questions, almost all of them say the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Certainly it- is a great error for a city like St. Petersburg to put its destinies in the hands of men who have made nc» better use of their opportunities for teaching the people the truth than is indicated by the expressions of Gypsy Smith and Charles M. Sheldon, which every honest and thoughtful man today knows are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A Stupendous Contrast</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While, as above plainly shown, sectarianism has been losing its hold upon the people, the Lord has been raising up and using a layman to do the work which the clergy have not done and cannot do, that of explaining the Bible to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is the reason why in the last ten years Judge Rutherford’s works in explanation of the Bible have been distributed to the extent of 93% million copies, and every week in America -alone his lectures on .Bible topics are broadcast by more than 190 radio stations? It. is because he sticks to the Bible, and the Bible alone, and lets sectarianism go just where Mr. Smith and Mr. Sheldon show it has gone and is going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is there any reason why St. Petersburg should lag behind Orlando, Miami Beach and Tampa?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can it be true that the citizens of St. Petersburg cannot be trusted to hear what goes out regularly from Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah, Columbus, Thomasville, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery. Meridian, Bristol, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, Little Boek, New Orleans, Shreveport and the ten biggest cities in Texas?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of these cities hover around the Gulf of Mexico. How does it come that their citizens are freely permitted to hear regularly what the clergy of St. Petersburg would fain deny to the people of that community ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is there any reason why St. Petersburg should be content to be thrust into the Clearwater village class when it could just as well line up with Nev; York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, Boston, and all the other biggest cities all over the country, 190 of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is there any reason why a program that is acceptable to the great pioneer broadcasting stations KDKA (Pittsburgh.) and WGY (Schenectady) should be withheld from the citizens of St. Petersburg who wish to listen in to programs of their home station, WSUN?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A Contract Violated, and Why</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On November 18, the Radio Control Board at WSUN entered into a contract for twenty-six broadcasts of electrical transcriptions of Judge Rutherford’s lectures on the Bible. These broadcasts were to be from 12:15 to 12:30, noon, each Sunday from December 7, 1930, to May 31, 1931, inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The village of Clearwater has been accorded some privileges in connection with the city of St. Petersburg in the use of Station WSUN on Sundays. Now it happens that the head man of the village, Mr. Baskin, is a dry candidate. As such, he apparently does not know that Jesus turned water into wine in violation of the Volstead Act, nor that Jesus was called a winebibber, noi’ that He had wine at the last meal He ever had on earth. No doubt Mr. Baskin would be equally shocked if he knew that the Apostle Paul advised that the aged women should not be given to much wine, and thus indicated that the old ladies took an occasional nip, and that he told Timothy that he also could take a little now and then without getting some friendly physician to write him a special prescription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Baskin thought it was too bad that in one of his booklets Judge Rutherford should have drawn attention to these and other scriptures, and he also seemed to think that Judge Rutherford's concept of the value of sectarianism is as bad as that held by Gypsy Smith or Charles M. Sheldon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accordingly, Mr. Baskin, of the village of Clearwater used his influence with the city of St. Petersburg to violate the contract which had been entered into for the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford's lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How the Violation Was Brought About</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The way the violation was brought about was that all the “ministers” in St. Petersburg were invited to hoar the records at 3: 00 o’clock p. m., Saturday, December 13, 1930. About half the “ministers” of the city came. Among them were those whose names are preceded by asterisks (*) in the following list of the city's recognized religious leaders:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">To make a long story short, these clergymen, although they said they could find no fault with anything they heard, nevertheless emphatically objected to having Judge Rutherford’s lectures go out, for the reason, as they insisted, that “they would cause controversy”; that is, they would cause the people to see and know and recognize the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whether through his contact with these clergymen, or however it w<sup>T</sup>as, the head man of the village of Clearwater insisted that the records should not be broadcast. Mr, Baskin seemed to agree with the St. Petersburg &quot;minister” who testified at the “censorship” meeting that the lectures of- Judge Rutherford were “’worse than Russian communism”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hoivever, after hearing the records, the president of the Radio Control Board could still see no reason for not putting on the program, although he was unwilling to take a stand individually against -the opinion of the “’ministers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a result, the contract was canceled, Mr. Baskin (the prohibition candidate) and the clergy being the only ones who wished it done,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The People Will Decide &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the long run the people of St. Petersburg are bound to sometime come to a decision as to w’lio is to run their beautiful city: whether it shall be run by intelligent, progressive men, or W’hether even its thinking is to be censored for its residents by men who have accomplished the results pointed out by Gypsy Smith and Charles M.

<p><span class="font8">In order to give everybody a fair opportunity to see just what it was that the “ministers” of Si. Petersburg 'dreaded to have come to the ears of the people o£ their city, we append hereto the three -’lectures which they heard and which speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems to us that “The Sunshine City” should remove its handicap by getting rid of .its e’ergy censorship ol<sup>!</sup> Scripture and common sense. Why try to hang </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">on to a</span><span class="font8"> Jonah who is only rocking the boat and sinking the ships There is plenty of room for him elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">*Be sure to read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A-&lt; Possible Explanation</span><span class="font5"> (page 348) after carefully considering the three lectures, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, The Bible. Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH, the Almighty God, the Most High, is the Maker of all things good. He is from everlasting to everlasting, and there is none other. lie covers himself with light for his garment, and all light proceeds from him. He created the heavens and stretched them out like a curtain and filled them with </span><span class="font15">his </span><span class="font6">reflected glory. He laid the chief corner stone and foundations of the earth and built it according to his sovereign will. In its youth he made the cloud for its garment of covering and the thick 'darkness for its swaddling-cloth. He set the sun in the heavens for the light of the earth by day, and the moon and the myriad of stars for its light by night. He even numbered the st:<sup>!</sup>.rs and gave each one a name. With him everything Is order and there is no confusion. He causes the stars and the planets to take their respective places and move continuously in their assigned orbits. He has made the mountains to lift their heads high above the sea and has commanded the eagle to mount up above the rocky crag and to make her nest in the strong places, fie has clothed the earth in verdure and filled the great forests with beasts and fowls of the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He created man in perfection and made him the prince of the earth. The eternal destiny of all creation he holds in his mighty hand. The depth of the riches of his wisdom and knowledge, and the height of his power and love, are too great for the comprehension of man. The Almighty One, however, condescends to invite man to come and reason with him and to learn of his way. To know and to obey God means to have life everlasting in peace and happiness. Where then should man expect to find knowledge and wisdom, except in the revelation of the Almighty God? His Word is a fountain of knowledge and wisdom,, ever flowing- to supply refreshment and life to those who drink therefrom. He is the Fountain of life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is the origin and source of all true prophecy. In proof of this statement it is written in Isaiah 44:6: “Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God. .And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? and the things that are coining, and that shall come to pass, declare unto them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great Creator has revealed himself to his creatures by several names, each one of which is deeply significant. By his name JEHOVAH is meant his purposes toward his creatures. His name GOD denotes that ho is the Creator of everything that is good. His name ALMIGHTY signifies that his power is without limitation and that nothing can successfully resist him. His name MOST HIGH means that ho is supreme and above all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why is there such gross ignorance concerning God and his goodness toward men? The correct answer is that long centuries ago Satan the enemy of God turned man into the paths of unrighteousness, and rebellion and since then lias blinded men to the truth. In doing this Satan has employed divers agencies, many of which, have claimed to represent Ged but who in fact have misrepresented him. Practicing hypocrisy these men have been used by Satan to turn the people away from Jehovah and. into darkness. God could have prevented this, to be sure, but his wisdom led him. to permit the enemy to do .his worst, 'that God might in his due time prove to all intelligent creation that he is supreme and that those who would have life must obey him and walk in the way of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest truth that all men must learn is that of and concerning- the kingdom of God. That kingdom, will completely vindicate God’s 'Word and his name and it will, bring paradise and endless joy to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no government on earth, that is satisfying to honest men. There never was a government that was satisfactory to honest men. The reason is that there is so much dishonesty practiced amongst men; and. all people are afflicted with disease, sickness and death. That unhappy condition began more than sixty centuries ago, when perfect man was in Eden. The. rebellion of Satan led to the downfall of man and brought death upon all human creation. In that hour of distress God gave his word of promise that ‘the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of him who brought death upon mankind’, The “woman” there</span></p>

Tens of thousands of dogs are disemboweled, burned alive and otherwise tortured in vivisection experiments every year by the alleged medical scientists of America and Europe.

In October it concluded to lay off 2,500 men at its Staten Island plant, but Mr. Mellon, for some inscrutable reason, had this postponed until after election.

Occasionally when a film breaks one may hear one of these operators say something like a prayer, but it never just occurred to us that it would be appropriate for Sunday use in Mattoon. But Mattoon is a wonderful town, and they will no doubt stand for it all O. K. if the mayor says to do so. Anyway, it will be said in a closet or booth; and that is something.</span></p>

In the Colorado school where I taught, the children received consistently lower marks after they were vaccinated, and nearly all of them suffered from some skin disease within three months. ... I have proved beyond the peradventure of a doubt that vaccination impairs the mentality of children, reducing the Intelligence quotient’ in a marked degree.”</span></p>

He said in part: “When on the one side you have a vast volume of production, and on the other side you have millions of men insufficiently supplied with the requirements of life, such as food and clothing, the obvious conclusion is that failure proceeds from inadequate facilities of circulation and exchange rather than from excessive ability to produce. The gold standard of the world lias become unstable. The deficiency in the supply of gold will become more marked in the course of a few years, and there is no likelihood either that tl ic production of gold from the mines will increase, or that the nonmonetary demand for gold will fall off. Relief must therefore be derived from remedial measures in the management of'.gold, a greater economy in its use, and a more intelligent utiliza-tian of the reserves whidi exist&quot; The address west on to say that France and the United States own more than half the total gold reserves of the world, and the inference is that this congestion of gold is causing stagnation of world trade.</span></p>

Natives are not allowed to buy or hire land, except in certain scheduled areas, without special permission of the governor-general; thus they not only hold less than a tenth as much land as the whites, though they are four times as numerous, but their land, on the whole, is poorer.” To which we merely add that Jesus said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,” and, ‘Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so to them.’</span></p>

Wise man. He did well to get a job while one was to be had. By the time some of these preachers and priests get ready to lend a hand in the world’s work they may have to wait quite a while for a job. But they will all come to it, sooner or later. The business of resting at other people’s expense, and whining, and shaking collection baskets at them, is about-over. Better days are ahead.</span></p>

She had enough money to pay for a night’s lodging at the Y. W. C. A., and 35c besides. The 35c she promptly invested in Christmas cards at 1c each, which she sold on a street corner at 5e each. She did this twice and went to supper on the profits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Women have been known to run up stairs rapidly so as to squeeze on board an elevated train just coming into the station, and on arriving at their destination have had nothing to do but amuse themselves. by sitting down and watching the trains go by, for quite a considerable time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A railroad watchman testifies that he has often seen, people risk their lives by running under the gates after he has lowered them., and having gained the opposite side of the tracks they have stood and watched the train pass. Often a passenger will fight for a place in an overcrow’ded bus when one right behind it will take him to his destination within a few seconds of the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A British philosopher declares that the modern world is a place in which no one knows where he is going, but wants to go there faster and faster. That would seem comical if it were not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures tell us that “he that believeth shall not make haste”. Jehovah God does not seem to be in haste about anything. Leisure seems to mark every act. It takes but a day to make a moth, but it takes thirty years to make a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The lower animals can be stampeded, because they cannot resist the impulse to move when others of their kind move. A mob is the same. Anybody can start a stampede. Rise from your seat in a railway coach several miles before the train gets into the station, and press toward the door, and you will have half the people in the car on their feet in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The craze for speed has brought an end to the appreciation of leisure, to the reading of good books, to thoughtful and extended conversation and correspondence, to grace of manner, and to much that is best in art. Who can enjoy nature -when it is rushing by at the rate of over a hundred miles an hour? Even the sense of color is lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What It Accomplishes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It can he said on the other hand that valuable time is saved by speed, but if the time saved has to be spent in a hospital the net saving is negligible. It may be and often is a valuable advertisement for some railway or steamship line, and occasionally there is a very busy man ■who can make good use of every moment saved in travel, but there are hosts of people who travel swiftly who could drop out of the world and never be missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Youth seems to adapt itself to the speed mania more readily than, those of us who were born in the days when the horse and buggy were the vehicles of speedy transport. It is the young men that do the work in American factories. The old men cannot keep the pace. After 45 out they go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is said that men who get lost in a desert run furiously until they drop from exhaustion. The running provides them with something to do which enables them to forget that they are lost. By some the speed mania is declared to be another kind of this peculiar form of dread. It is a rush that- is pictured to the mind as a necessity, though the necessity really does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not to be wondered at that children love speed, when their mothers were driving racing ears or skipping around in the clouds only a few minutes before they were born; but at the same time it is just as well to remember that the asylums are overcrowded and new ones can. hardly be built fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The manager of the largest theater , in New-York declares that he keeps its 6,254 seats filled because everything is speeded up, even the overtures. He has found that speed, not jazz, is what the people want. If they have action, and plenty of it, and at high speed, they are contented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Describing the time-saving devices now in vogue, the Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font8"> mentions the ‘quick lunch tablet’ in which the concentrated essence of a full meal can be sw’allowed instan-ter, and a special electric chair in which in three minutes a man can he given the benefit of an hour’s violent exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul Morand, French writer, says of America : “The notion that a thing done quickly is badly done is still deep rooted in European minds. The expression </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘a V americaine’</span><span class="font8"> means to us a mixture of speed and bluff. Twenty million autos in the United States. Trains and carriages</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Century</span><span class="font8"> magazine says: “Science persists in teaching us how to prolong life by means of right eating and sun bathing; and then it destroys us with its inventions for shattering our nervous systems. Those who are educated to the modern rhythm declare that they think hotter when being whirled along at sixty miles an hour; that the grandeur and glamor of the city is stimulating; that the noise and haste breed ideas and stimulate action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Animal* Speedier than Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man is not such a speedy animal. The best he has ever been aide to do is to cover 100 yards in a little less than, ten seconds, or at the rate of about 31% feet a second. A camel can go just a little faster, when it is hurried up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A rabbit can go more than twice as fast as a. man. The driver of a motor ear in Switzerland trailed a rabbit in the road for over three miles and had to operate his car at 34 miles an hour in order to keep up with it. This is at the rate of 50 feet, a second, the speed of a giraffe. Rabbits can do up to 58 feet a second for a considerable distance. A fast horse is faster than the fastest rabbit, but they are of about equal speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An English fox hound will make 60 feet a second, and a man running on skis 72 feet. The fastest deer ever accurately timed was a roebuck, which made 74 feet in a second. Some of the smaller antelopes are much more speedy than the larger deer; the Indian cheetah goes at 88 feet a second: and there are trained dogs which are said to have run 90 feet in a second, or about three times the fastest pace of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An eagle is a comparatively slow bird on the wing, making only about 75 feet a second. The ostrich makes 80 feet a second, the albatross 88 feet, and a man leaping on skis 100 feet. The homing pigeon has been known to maintain a speed of 132 feet a second for 100 miles; and a falcon has been known to maintain a speed of 133 feet a second for ten times as far, having flown? a distance of 1,000 miles in eleven hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great, heavy, wild goose has been known to rush through the air at the astonishing rate-of 175 feet a second. The ordinary flight of the-swallow is 210 feet a second, and in full flight it has been known to go at the rate of 290 feet a second. The fastest bird in the world is the spine-tailed swift, which skims over the mountains of Asia at the rate of 323 feet a second. This is more than ten times as fast as man can get over the ground unaided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fastest fish, the tarpon of Florida, has been known to cover 112 feet a second. The jumping mouse of the African deserts makes eighty leaps of ten feet each a second. This is more than twenty-five times as fast as man can perform the same stunt. The flea can beat the? mouse, with a velocity of 850 feet a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fastest thing on this earth, so far as is now known, is the deer fly, which has the most perfect motor apparatus of any creature. The breathing apparatus is such, that their bodies are virtually all air cells or chambers, which gives them extreme lightness. The' muscles which operate the wings are marvelously powerful, and for short distance this little creature can travel at the incredible speed of 1,175 feet a second. This is thirty-seven times as fast as poor man can navigate on his unaided legs. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fast </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Travel Only a Century Old</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Up until 1830 the fastest that man ever traveled was with the use of horses on land and sails on water. The development of the steam engine quickly ran the speeds up to 30, 4.0, 50 and 60 miles an hour. Some of the efforts to forestall or prevent these speeds seem comical now. The British parliament refused at first to grant a charter to Stephenson because lie claimed that his engine would be able to travel at the terrible speed of 12 to 15 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wise college professors, such as are now on the Power Trust payroll, gave forth opinions that at 60 miles an hour goods would disiistc-gratc, iron bars would melt, and onions would lose their smell. Even when the speeds had been made, the record was denied and declared an impossibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Magellan’s ship circled the globe in 1,083 days. In 1872, Jules Verne sent Phineas Fogg around the world, in fiction, in 80 days. Some of ns remember when Nellie 'Bly was sent around by the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font8"> in 72 days. Since then the Lime has been repeatedly reduced, until the Graf Zeppelin made the trip in less than 22 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In June, 1899, Mile-a-Minute Murphy, riding behind a Long-Island railroad train,-within a hood built on the end of the last car, rode a measured mile on a bicycle in sixty-odd seconds. Shortly, the motor cycle and the automobile appeared on the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just at present we are witnessing the beginnings of rocket propulsion. There is almost no limit at which rockets cannot travel. With adequate fuel supply they could probably go 1,000 miles an hour. A rocket-propelled vehicle has already made 150 miles an hour. Thirty-six rockets were used. The spokes of all four wheels snapped during the test, but the machine remained on the track and finished the course on its hubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If man ever travels outside of earth’s atmosphere it will be in a rocket-propelled vehicle. A rocket ear, ascending to the region of the vacuum outside the earth’s atmosphere, would lose thereby none of its force of propulsion. On the contrary, its speed would be increased by virtue of the absence of air resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Speed on the Sea</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would seem that profitable speed on the sea had about reached its maximum,. The Mauretania held the speed record for more than twenty years, and although the Bremen and Europa have both reduced the Mauretania’s record by eight hours, yet there must now be an enormous addition to the size and power of the propelling plant to effect any considerable further increase in speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course those who do not have to consider the expense of anything can still build destroyers, cruisers and airplane carriers that will run around anything else afloat, but transportation companies cannot, afford to design and operate boats that have little or no space for cargo or passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not certain that some of the newest boats can be operated profitably year in and year out; and if they cannot be so operated, then the humbler travelers who go on the slower ships will he made to pay the difference. Travel de luxe ought to be self-sustaining; but it is not, and it is well known that celebrities usually get their hotel and steamer fares at much less than other folks have to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The greatest speed ever attained on water was by Sir Henry Seagrave, on. Lake Windermere, in the Miss England II. The boat overturned and Sir Henry was killed, but before his death he had covered one mile at 96.41 miles an hour, and a second mile at 101.11 miles an hour. The mean between the two, which now constitutes the world's speed record on water, is 98.76 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Speeds on Railways &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are at least seven well authenticated records of passenger trains doing better than 100 miles an hour away back at the beginning of the present century, between May, 1893, and October, 1904. The first of these was on the New York Central, near Batavia, N. Y., over a measured mile, slightly down grade. The engine was the famous No. 999, and the time, 32 seconds for the mile, was at the rate of 112.5 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The climax was in March, 1901, when the Plant system operated a train between Fleming and Jacksonville, 5 miles, in 2 minutes and 30 seconds, or 120 miles an hour. The Pennsylvania, Burlington and Michigan Central have each operated trains for short distances at over 100 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fastest scheduled train in the United States is on the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, between Camden, N. J., and Atlantic City. The 55% miles between the two cities are covered in 55 minutes. A noteworthy long-distance train on the American continent is on foe 334-mile Montreal-Toronto run. The Canadian National Railway hauls twelve steel ears over this run at the rate of 55.7 miles an hour. Fastest of all is the Michigan Central’s Wolverine, which averages nearly 58 miles an hour for 228 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fastest train in the world is the run on the Great Western Railway, England, where the 77% miles from Swindon to Paddington are made in 70 minutes. The Canadian National Railways sent an oil-electric locomotive through from Montreal to Vancouver, 2,944 miles in 67 hours. The Santa Fe Chief is on a 56%-hour schedule, Chicago to Los Angeles, 2,231 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">British crack trains are faster than American. Fourteen daily trains over one line between London and Birmingham make more than 55 miles an hour, while the thirty-odd daily trains between London and Manchester and the twenty-eight between London and Leeds are unmatched elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In France the Paris-Calais express makes 53.7 miles an hour, and the Paris-Lille express 55.6 an hour. There are twenty passenger trains out of Paris that make 50 miles an hour. Else-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">where in Europe the top speeds are 38 miles an hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The president of the Pere Marquette Railroad predicts that the time will come when concrete ways with reinforced steel beams will crisscross over the country, and trains will run on roller bearings, safely, at 100 miles an hour, or about 147 feet a second. Under the most favorable conditions a distance of nearly half a mile would be required in which to effect a stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Freight trains, the country over, stops included, averaged 10.3 miles an hour in 1930, which is 20 percent slower than in 1928. The Erie and some other roads have through freights which are scheduled to make 25 to 30 miles an hour, These trains are carrying double what they carried a few years back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In driving a train at fast speed it becomes necessary to know how fast the mind will operate in coming to conclusions and acting upon them. In a case in Germany it was demonstrated in court that four seconds was ample time for a conductor to notice that the engine driver was negligent and did not set the brake at the right time, to perceive the danger to the train, to remember his duty to take action, to decide to set the emergency brake and to carry out his decision. This was in. a ease where the engineer was asleep at his post and fourteen persons were killed as a result of the accident which ensued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">AntGrsmbile Speeds</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world’s speed records for automobiles are made at Daytona Beach, Florida, where there is an eleven-mile stretch of disintegrated coquina rock and ordinary sand, wave-rolled and water-packed, which defies duplication as a natural motorway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In ‘trying for a speed record over this course Sir Henry Seagrave had specially built for him the fastest motor in the world, 900 horsepower, at a cost of above; $50,000. In practicing for the test four miles were needed to pick up speed before entering the mile on &gt;’111011 he was timed electrically and five miles were needed in which to stop. The tires had to be changed after every trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The speed with which the nervous system carries messages to and from the brain is about 108.4 feet, a second. Major Seagrave drove his car at the rate of 339.33 feet a second, three times as fast as his brain, was capable of working. To guide him he had a number of red bull’s-eye lights strung over the center of the course. At the end of the course was another guiding light. On the front of the car was a small circle with crossed wires, and in the cockpit an ordinary naked rifle sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the record of 231.36246 miles an hour was made, Mr. Seagrave said, on the one side, was an immense black wall of spectators; on the other side the flagposts rushing by looked like a straight line drawn across a piece of typewriter paper. Spectators said the ear seemed to flutter over the course. Each pebble caused it to leap, as the ordinary spring’ suspension had not time to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">California has abolished speed laws. It says to the motorist, in substance, <sup>£</sup>You are subject to punishment for misdemeanor if you drive a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard to the traffic, surface and width of the highway? This means that you must not drive at a speed too great to permit you to exercise proper control of the vehicle and to avoid colliding with any other person or vehicle using the liiglnvay in a mechanical manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the last twenty years the speed at which automobiles traverse city streets has almost doubled. Every year the auto kills about 30,000 persons. It seems a high price to pay for speech In actual practice the safe cruising speed is around 30 to 35 miles an hour. The faster speeds, 70 to 80 miles an hour, and up, are supposed to be merely for use in emergencies, but the possession of them invites their use, with the consecjuent disasters now<sup>7</sup> so common. An automobile which is to make sixty miles an hour must have engines not twice, but eight times, as powerful as those required to make but thirty miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Speeds in the Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When A. H. Orlebar flew in the Schneider cup races at a speed of 368.8 miles an hour lift was projecting himself through space at the rate of 541 feet a second. And this ought to be fast enough; but higher speeds are contemplated, and it is believed that in a sealed cockpit 1,000 miles an hour would be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At such a speed it would not be possible to make any turns, or to make any movements up or down, as the centrifugal force would either drain or flood a man’s brain, and cause either unconsciousness or death. On the downward thrust of his famous outside loop, when traveling at the rate of 300 miles an hour, Lieutenant James Doolittle states, he felt as if his eyeballs were being torn from their sockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At speeds above the reasonable cruising speed of 90 miles an hour there are technical difficulties to be overcome. Thus the resistance in the air increases as the cube of the speed. If to go 200 miles an hour requires an- engine of 500 horsepower, to go at 400 miles an hour will require one of 4,000 horsepower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That some men are seriously thinking of undertaking flights at 1,000 miles an hour is clear from the fact that the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics is experimenting in the wind tunnels at their Langley Field (Va.) laboratories with velocities up to that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is within the bounds of imagination to conceive that, when power can be broadcast, some man may yet go around the entire earth traveling with the sun. But what would be the sense of it, even if such a thing could be done? It would be but insanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not generally known that an object falling’ from an altitude never attains a greater speed than 118 miles an hour. This velocity is reached within six seconds after falling about 600 feet in quiet air. Thus, Mr. Orlebar flew through the air more than three times as fast as he could have fallen through it, when he attained the record speed of 368.8 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The average velocity of a service-rifle bullet is 398 feet a second, or 271 miles an hour, so it would have done no good for anybody to shoot at Mr. Orlebar for breaking the speed laws, unless they shot ahead of him and counted on his overtaking the bullet and Tunning into if, for he traveled through, the air nearly 40 percent faster than the bullet could go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The direction and force of. the wind makes a big difference in flying, or even in driving a car or a railway train or a boat, for that matter. In flying the 700 miles from New York to Chicago the journey may be made one way in. seven hours, and in the other in five hours if the aviator has a twenty-mile wind behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shape is an important element in speed. The air resistance of a cylinder with semispherical ends is only one-fifth that of a cylinder with flat ends. French locomotives save 15 to 20 horsepower by having rounded boiler fronts. America must do the same and round the corners of freight and passenger cars, to save time and fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It lias been observed that ducks and other swimming birds, fast fish and such stvift flyers as the albatross, are rounded and blunt in breast or head, the part that cleaves the air or water. A swift bird on the wing always draws up its legs close to its body and stretches its neck as far ahead as possible. Airplanes are now being designed to make full use of this information. Even the running wheels are tucked away in some designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the greatest speeds and at the greatest heights not only do the fliers need to be provided with artificial supplies of oxygen, but similar provision must be made for the engines, as they choke and die in the thin air the same as humans. At the highest speeds the positive pressure on the nose tends to force the front of a vehicle down, while the suction behind tends to force the tail upward. These and many other exceedingly valuable things have been learned in the operation of the laboratory wind tunnels now connected with engineering schools in all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buff alo—Rochester—Hamilton—Toronto</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font8">UFFALO, Rochester, Hamilton and Toronto all lie within a few miles of each other’, with Niagara Falls in the center, supplying electric current to all four. Does it make any difference which way the current is ’'shipped'? It should not, but it does. The reason it makes a difference is that the people themselves own the Canadian transmission system, while on the American side the people are at the mercy of what are euphonically called “private corporations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quoting from a state report, just published, under the Ontario commission, here are a few comparisons: A domestic consumer using thirty-six kilowatts a month would pay $1.59 in Buffalo, $2.69 in Rochester, $1.98 in Syracuse. But in Ontario he would pay 95 cents in Hamilton and $1.03 in Toronto. Now note between a large consumer in these cities: If he used 175 kilowatts a month in Buffalo he must pay $5.01, $9.75 in Rochester, $6,15 in Syracuse. In the two Ontario cities for exactly the same service: .Toronto, $2.33; Hamilton, $2.71. Even up to 10,000 kilowatts a month the rates in the two Canadian cities are lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">U</span><span class="font8">NDER the title “Dear Canada!” the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Magazine,</span><span class="font8"> contains an article by Grattan O’Leary concerning the high cost of living in this country, from which we quote in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada has vast grain fields, raises 350,000,000 bushels of wheat more than she can use. She raises livestock, sheep, pigs; has an abundance of butter, cheese, milk, eggs. Has, at all events, all necessary facilities for the production of such things. Canada, too, has millions of acres of forest, the raw material of shelter: has tens of thousands of square miles of soil producing vegetables and fruits. From the standpoint of food supplies she is self-contained, raises more food than she consumes. And as with shelter and food, so also with fuel. Our scientists never weary of telling us that we have enough coal to last us a million years,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this being true, how comes it that in Canada food and fuel, clothing and shelter, cost so much ? Why are they costing more now than twenty years ago? Why, • ■specially when we know that transportation and distribution facilities have been improved, and when, as we are assured by the economists, scientific research and modem machinery have increased and cheapened production, reduced overhead costs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That prices are high, that they are higher than twenty years ago, and that, even more serious, they are higher in Canada than in most other countries, there is no doubt at all. On this point comparative official figures are clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us take a few illustrations. Bread in 1913 sold for three cents a pound. Today the price is seven cents a pound. Milk in 1913 sold for nine cents a quart. Today it sells for 13 cents a quart. Eighteen or twenty years ago, anthracite coal could be bought for $7.90 a ton. Today it can be bought only at $15.00 a ton. And beef, which sold for 22 cents a pound in 1913, sells in 1930 for 39 cents. The figures are from government publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dominion Bureau of Statistics and Labor Department keep tab on these things. From their official records, provided by experts after thorough inquiry, the following comparative prices on actual living commodities for the years 1913 to 1930 are 1aken:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Then he asks the question, Who is profiteering? and in answer says: &nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All that we know, and we know this for a certainty,, is that the producer is getting little more for his. produce than before the war, that the middleman is getting a lot more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is the effect of farm products raised in Canad.a selling higher here than they sell elsewhere? The effect of Canadian flour, and Canadian bacon and other things from Canadian farms selling' lower m England, for instance, than they sell in Canada?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effect may be considered in two ways: (1) the consequences to the average Canadian householder or working man; (2) the consequences upon Canada’s development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us consider the individual. The average Canadian worker, not a skilled laborer, and working at full time, receives in wages, roughly speaking, about $1,200 a year. What does ho have to pay out ? According to the most competent economists, he must, if he is married and has a family of four, pay out the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fuel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;105.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Food &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;750.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clothes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Drugs and doctors’ bills &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Carfare &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1,430.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus, according to this budget, which certainly seems conservative, a Canadian worker with four of a family, and working full time, would find himself at the end of the year $230 behind. And this assumes that he would have worked full time, that he would not be laid off by illness; assumes, also, that he would pay not a cent for insurance, nor give anything to a church, nor pay out a cent to take his wife and his children to a movie. The idea of recreation, of a vacation, of travel, or of having a radio, or indulging the slightest luxury, is not even considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the unemployment situation going from bad to worse, with an unfavorable trade balance, with elevators full of grain and no market therefor, conditions in Canada are becoming somewhat desperate to large numbers in this country, and this is reflected in a revolutionary spirit taking hold of the needy' in the city of Port Arthur. Under the caption “Lake City Mobilizes to Combat Red Force”, the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Citizens of this city today enrolled in hundreds at the Canadian Legion headquarters as special constables to combat the Red threat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is thought the enrollment, is sufficient to prevent such incidents as those of Monday night, when policeofficers were mobbed and a prisoner taken from them by the rioters. The volunteers will also be ready to prevent the Communists from putting into effect the threats they have made to loot stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demands made to the city council, which, if not met, will result in the looting of the stores, according to threats, are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“1. We demand that a council, elected by the unemployed themselves, be allowed to participate in organization of relief work and in giving assistance to the, unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“2.</span><span class="font6"> We oppose the so-called ‘relief basket’ method to families and the soup kitchens for single men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“3. We demand that groceries will be given on credit from the stores to families and that necessary clothing will be given to the unemployed according to their needs. The municipality to pay rents, water and electricity bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“4. We demand free-fare to places of relief employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“5. We demand the delay of payment of debts until such time when steady employment is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ 6. Tickets to be used by the unemployed that would enable them to eat at ordinary restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ 7. The municipality to pay the rent of single men during unemployment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Even the liquor trade is feeling the hard times the country is passing through. A news item in this connection from Saskatchewan, reported in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font8"> Toronto, reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Twenty-five beer stores in Saskatchewan are to be closed down by the Liquor Board before the end of the present year and, if conditions call for it, still more will be closed accordingly, Hon. M. A. Mae-Pherson, K. C., Attorney-General, announced, at the closing session of the Saskatchewan Prohibition League convention. The announcement was coincidental with a resolution passed by the convention calling for the suspension of Government control during the present economic crisis by the closing of all liquor and beer stores for as long as the depression lasts. The resolution urged that the. Government take this step as an emergency measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The president of the Radio Manufacturers’ Association, at a banquet in Toronto, declared that Canada heads the world in radios. We quote him in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More money is spent by the people of Canada per capita for radio receiving sets than that by the people of any other part of the world, United States not excepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Canada during 1928 there were produced radio receiving sets, parts and accessories to a value of almost $13,000,000. In 1929 this figure increased to $21,000,000, an increase of 62 percent, a remarkable and almost unbelievable growth, particularly during a period that was very trying to most Canadian industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are, at present, in Canada, eighteen plants producing radio receiving sets, and it is estimated that in 1930 there will have been produced between 175,000 and 200,000 radio receivers. There are four factories producing tubes. Last year the production was in excess of three million, and it is estimated that in 1930 the production will approach the five million mark. There are some 600,000 radio receiving sets in Canada; in the province of Ontario alone there are in excess of 250,000 sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking of the phenomenal progress of aviation in Canada, Major-General J. II. Mac-Brien is reported in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Globe as </span><span class="font8">saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Canada has much useful and important work for aircraft, probably more than any other country. Aviation is organized into four main divisions. These are now given with some of the work in each division:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Military training for defense purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Civil government operations—forestry protection, aerial survey, exploration, crop and tree dusting, timber cruising, forest sketching, fisheries, protection, customs work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. Commercial aviation—most of those activities mentioned in item two are carried out by commercial companies as well. Then there is: Air transportation —of mails, express and passengers; aerial service— flying schools, taxi service, sightseeing, aerial photography for industrial advertising, air pageants, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. Private flying—for business oi<sup>-</sup> pleasure.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Canada’s geographical position will make her one of the most important units in Empire and world transportation. This fortunate position is a result of the curvature of the world’s surface, and also of the distribution of the population of the world. Long airroutes, as long sea routes, are laid out along “Great Circles’“Great Circle” is the navigator’s name for the shortest distance between two points on the earth’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An examination of a world globe will show that the shortest route from:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(a) Western Europe to Japan, China and the Ear East, is across Canada.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(b) 'United States to Northern and Western Europe is over the central and eastern part of Canada.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(e) United States to Asia and the Far East is over the western part of Canada.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">On account of Canada’s fortunate geographical position and splendid flying climate, our airways are of very special importance, and can he made one of our greatest national assets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font8">ERHAPS no stranger conference than this one has ever before been called together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost by chance a great continent populated by a fifth of the human race fell under the control of the British Parliament. For many years we have governed it to the best of our ability; increasing its economic resources, giving its people law, order, education of sorts. We. have been ruthless often; we have made mistakes often; our general attitude has been one of benevolent arrogance. But it is beyond question that British rule has conferred great benefits on India. Along with the material things that we brought to India from Europe came also Europe’s ideas. Huge dams and steam engines revolutionized India’s economic life, and Western ideas revolutionized her spiritual life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nationalism was born and nationalism flourished, and it is with nationalism more than anything else that the Round-table Conference will have to reckon. Over and above the smaller interests of communities and princes and merchants it will hang, a wold, dominating force, based on our own ideas and our own enthusiasms, on ideas and enthusiasms which have grown worn and stale in the West through the grim history of the last twenty years but which speak back to us from India with all their old freshness. For India, as Asia generally, is reborn. It is we who are old now and she who is young. That ancient civilization.which slept for so many centuries has awakened and will no longer meet us except as equal to equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oppression at Every Tom</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8"> AM a farmer (tenant), and as I see it we farmers are in a fix, due to oppression by big business organizations. We have to sell at their bidding. When we buy, we pay the price demanded or do without.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here let me cite to you some observations of my own: My workshirt made of cotton cost 89c. It weighs one pound. The farmer who produced the cotton got about 10c for it. Recently I sold a calf hide of twenty-five pounds for $1.00. At the same time I bought a pair of shoes, about two pounds, costing me $4.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My overalls cost $1.50; about two pounds of cotton in them. I was talking with a man who has worked in a cotton mill. He said an operator of the weaving machines could turn out one thousand yards a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By D. L. Gipson (Tennessee)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another thought has struck me. Here we have a law that prohibits a butcher’s buying fresh-killed meat from the farmer unless killed in a slaughterhouse. The specifications for the slaughterhouse are such that the farmer cannot afford to meet them. This forces the farmer to sell to the big packer, and the butcher to buy from him; therefore the packer has both ends of the rope. This law is supposed to be a pure food law, but if my sense of smell is right it is the law of the big packer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Cancer—'Why the Increase? </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Uy Dr. Mae Johnson Work (New I'ork)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[Read at the Seventh Annual Convention </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> the American Electron's Research Association.}</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8">X TITTS paper I filial I give the overwhelming statistics to show you the great increase of cancer in the past two to three years and the call for help from every quarter. Also, the cause for the increase, and the remedy for it. It is a stupendous task that I have undertaken, but I have been thoroughly impressed and convinced that we as eleetronists have in our hands the weapon to smite the dread enemy if we but know the great cause and reach that before we try to eliminate the reactions of cancer. When Dr. Abrams first made his announcement of E. R. A. to the world, cancer, its cause and cure, was the subject and main theme back of all his work. In his “New Concepts” he said, &quot;Cancer is on the increase. During the year 1915 the cancer mortality in the United States (Continental) was over 80,000 and it lias been suggested that cancer in time may exterminate the entire human race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lot us now observe more recent statistics. In 1927 the Metropolitan Life Insurance company gave the following report on their findings. I quote in part from a booklet they issued: •'‘Cancer-.....-the Universal Menace! More</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">people over forty years of age die of cancer than of pneumonia, tuberculosis and typhoid fever; one woman in eight and one man in eleven of those who reach forty years of age will die of cancer. This high death rate shows that cancer is a menace to every one; your family; you. The menace of cancer lies in the fact that it does not cause pain in the first stages. Its victims, therefore, do not know that they have cancer until the disease is well developed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same report they also make this statement: &quot;Cancer is increasing strikingly among mon, in a number of organs in sites which are not now segregated for statistical study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. William F. Koch, of Detroit, says: &quot;Cancer has become so prevalent in the last twenty years that the public has a quite definite conception of its nature. Indeed, this conception is even more in accord with practical experience with the disease than the statement issued by the profession. Many millions of families have witnessed the progress of cancer in one or more of their dear ones from its earliest inception to its ultimate conclusion on the deathbed. They have usually observed it follow a course contradictory to the promises and explanation of the family physician and all his expert consultants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;In every instance, in spite of the most drastic surgery and X-ray and radium therapy, failure of a cure and aggravation of the disease has indelibly stamped the impression that this is a disease that is not to be conquered, by .local procedure, no matter how expertly and thoroughly performed, and no matter how ea.rly the attempt is made. The conclusion the public has reached is simply that the profession does not understand the disease at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Chas. Mayo makes this statement: &quot;In all my experiments, in plant and animal life, and in patients, I find that cancer is hereditary. We find that 65 percent of all humans die of diseases which killed their ancestors. Put conversely, we can tell, by a study of a man’s ancestors what he will die of—again with 65 percent of success.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">G.</span><span class="font8"> Fichera, in an article in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prensa Medica,</span><span class="font8"> says: “Cancer reaps its harvest, 500,000 yearly. No climate or race of people is exempt from cancer and one-half million die each, year of the disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A clipping from the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American.</span><span class="font8"> Jun e 18, 1930, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">COOPERATIVE CANCER RESEARCH PLAN URGED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Baltimore, June 16. (A. P.)—All sciences were called upon today to join in a national, cooperative research for the causes and cure of cancer. The call was issued at a three-day cancer meeting at Johns Hopkins University which began today, and was made by Dr. Joseph Coit Bloodgood. He said: “A start on the cooperative work already has been made in establishment by the Chemical Foundation of a special cancer journal, designed to make full details of cancer research available to the medical, profession, in reorganization of the American Society for Control of Cancel’ and in establishment of the Garvan Cancer Research Laboratory here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Chas. T. Betts, of Toledo, Ohio, has written a book as well as many pamphlets as to the prevalent cause of cancer. I quote from an article that appeared in the Toledo </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> December 13, 1925:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Don’t cook in aluminum—it sows cancer—grave maladies often caused by poison from these cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Disorders, he avers, began to gain high prevalence when wares were put on the market fourteen years ago. Cancer, nervous indigestion, gastritis and ulcer of the stomach are caused primarily by the use of aluminum utensils for cooking food, according to Dr. Chas. T. Betts, of Toledo, who reached his conclusions after several years’ research and experimental work. “Use of aluminum utensils in preparing foods produces a hydroxide of aluminum which becomes mixed with the foodstuffs and is taken into the stomach, resulting in the various stomach ailments now prevalent among Americans,” he said. 'There was a time, a few years ago, when the cause of these ailments was attributed to bad teeth and infected tonsils. This resulted in a teeth-extracting orgy, but the removal of the teeth and the tonsils has failed to check the prevalence of these particular stomach ills.’ Dr. Betts said that prior to 1911, when the sale of aluminum became general throughout the country, there were few cancer cases. “Since aluminum came into general use in 1911 stomach troubles and ulcer of the stomach have increased in astounding numbers,” he said. “In 1915 cancer of the stomach began to add to the death list of this country in an alarming degree, and in the United States, in 1924, deaths caused by cancer moved from 20th to 5th place as cause of deaths. It now (1930) occupies 2d place. It is my opinion that aluminum is the cause of most of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his book on aluminum poisoning, Dr. Betts cites an article by Dr. James Ewing which appeared in the New’ York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> of September 23,1926, from which I quote in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Ewing Pleads at Mohonk Lake for Wider Program of Prevention, Hits Hereditary Alarms, and Opposes the Theory that the Malady Is Due to a Universal Parasite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mohonk Lake, N. Y., Sept. 22.—Overemphasis on hereditary tendency toward cancer and ill-grounded announcements of the discoveries of alleged cancercausing organisms have retarded the course of cancer prevention and cancer control, according to Dr. James Ewing of New York, who addressed the conference of cancer specialists meeting here at the call of the American Society for the Control of Cancer. “Many cancers are the result of known irritations and are preventable,” said Dr. Ewing. “Cancers of the lip, mouth, tongue and tonsil,” he added, “are due mainly to broken or sharp-edged and uneven teeth or to tobacco. Gastric cancer is generally traced to abuse of the stomach. Early and abrupt weaning is a frequent cause of mammary cancer, although these and other cancers arc the result of known causes and can be prevented. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same book, Dr. Betts also refers to another article of importance along this line, from which I quote. This appeared in the Toledo (Ohio) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times,</span><span class="font8"> July 30,1928:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">MURPHY CANCER FINDINGS STIR THE ENTIRE MEDICAL WORLD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">N. </span><span class="font6">Y,, July 29—Indicating the extreme importance and significance of the announcement of Dr. James Murphy, associate of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, before the International Cancer Conference at London, that cancer is induced by a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">chemical ferment</span><span class="font6"> and not by a virus, the entire medical profession is in a furor. A canvass among the highest of available authorities shows the majority of the physicians and surgeons hesitate to characterize Dr. Murphy’s findings, since their information thus far is only fragmentary. Dr. Murphy admitted that his new postulate completely upset all previous work on the virus theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Betts said of Dr. Murphy’s announcement: “It is of interest to note that Dr. James Murphy made his discovery that cancer is induced by chemical poisons, for the Rockefeller Institute, New York, at the Cornell University, in collaboration with Dr. James Ewing, Professor of Pathology in that institution.” •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Betts further comments, in his book on aluminum poisoning, the following regarding these revelations: “The above findings of Dr. Murphy and Dr. Ewing substantiate the author’s finding upon metal aluminum poisoning as the cause of cancer.” Dr. Betts made this announcement two years and eight months before, as noted by my previous citation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the past two years in my practice in electronic medicine I have treated various cases suffering from digestive ailments, principally carcinoma in which there was some irritating cause aside from the ordinary intake of food and water, and I began to experiment on such cases. Having regulated the diet, and having reduced the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">carcinoma reaction</span><span class="font8"> and apparently cured the case by means of the E. R. A. diagnosis and treatment, I still found many cases having much distress after eating and in some instances they returned in six months or less with almost as much trouble as they had previously to the treatments. Upon diagnosis I found a return of the former carcinoma reactions. About that time Dr. G. Schmidt, of Lake City, Minn., gave a lecture before the A. E. R, A. Convention in Chicago (September, 1928) on the subject “Some Unusual Sources and Results of Al uminmn Poisonwg’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I wish to quote a few points from this lecture. He said, &quot;Coffee boiled ir. aluminum coffee pot is <sup>:</sup> darker than normal and has an off taste. Most candies are prepared in aluminum dishes and thus tliis is a prolific source of this poisoning, one lemon drop, one orange drop, and one peppermint separately giving this poison reaction inside of ten minutes. We all know about the aluminum baking powder, but we often forget this in buying bakery cakes, etc., made with that same baking powder. . . . The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sym-p-toms</span><span class="font8"> of an acute poisoning of even a medium dose are a peculiar feeling in the stomach which I would describe as a cross between a mild pain and hunger, coming within ten to twenty minutes and lasting about one-half to one hour and followed by a lazy, sluggish feeling all over, lasting from four to eight hours; after you have noted these symptoms on yourself several times you will know at once when you have been poisoned by aluminum.” Dr. Schmidt further stated, “.Tn a recent retest of over a hundred cases of cancer in various parts of the body I found this aluminum poison at the point of candor in every case.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After reading Dr. Schmidt’s lecture in the-journal and noticing the points he brought out regarding aluminum poisoning I began to put his suggestions in practice by suggesting to my patients the use of ware, for cooking utensils, other than aluminum, and. I found by the elimination of aluminum utensils there was a marked improvement in many eases, especially in stomach troubles, bronchial coughs and kidney disorders, but I found that even with that some trouble still existed. I concluded and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">later proved</span><span class="font8"> that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">unvitdlized aluminum</span><span class="font8"> was still in the system as a continual irritation and poison, and the eliminative organs having been overworked for so long a time were not strong enough, to throw off the poison without the electronic treatment for same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have examined since February of this year upward of 65 cases where carcinoma in the inflammatory stage and also the malignant stage appeared having an intensity of from 6 to 10 units and in every case the aluminum poison reaction was there and mostly of a higher amount than the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few of these eases for illustration of diagnosis and treatment might 'be interesting: last winter suffering from stomach distress and bronchial cough..The carcinoma energy had reappeared and I -would have been at a loss to determine the reason for it except for the fact that by now I was able to make a chemical analysis of the blood. Upon inquiry I found she had been eating food cooked in aluminum ware. I made the aluminum test, using the (periodic) atomic number and found she had 9 units of unvitalized aluminum and 6 units of carcinoma at the pylorus and. also in the entire alimentary tract and extending also to the bronchial tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the treatment, first, I insisted that she discontinue the use of aluminum, and then gave treatment on the oscilloclast until the entire aluminum reaction had disappeared, then, in a comparatively short time I cleared up the carcinoma with rate 6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all, she had about six weeks treatment. She has been discharged, is now in fine shape physically, and that has been some months ago. However, she reported recently having been, invited to the home of a friend and .having eaten, one meal that was cooked in alumiinmi. ware and for twenty-four hours she suffered the symptoms of aluminum poison, namely, a peculiar feeling of dull pain, and emptiness in the stomach, which appeared soon after eating and lasted about an hour, and then a sluggish, feeling lasting about six hours. After that experience she was extremely careful to inquire about the cooking utensils before eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another case: Miss I. W., age 40. A case suffering from carcinoma of the tongue, also stomach carcinoma, was cleared up and relieved of her trouble two years ago. Sho returned last winter complaining of distress and. uncomfortableness in the kidney region, also some stomach irritation. Upon electronic diagnosis of her blood I. found a carcinoma reaction in both locations and an aluminum reaction of 8 units. Upon, localization the reaction appeared in liver, spleen, kidneys and stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">She was immediately placed on treatment applying to all four of the locations one-half hour for each organ, the treatment lasting two hours. She improved,. but not satisfactorily, considering that amount of treatment. The aluminum reaction persisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">iaqiiuy I .found she had discarded all aluminum cooking utensils except a tea kettle for boiling water. As soon as I learned that I could see the cause of the slow progress. Since she abandoned the tea kettle she has steadily improved and is now recovered completely. Many other cases with similar symptoms and results could be quoted, but the above will give you the general idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an institution in our neighborhood in Brooklyn there are 200 people. During the past seven years we have treated various members of the institution, using to a great extent electronic treatment. The people there are of all ages, doing office work, printing books, etc. During five years of that time we had numerous cases of stomach and bowel trouble. But in the past two years, we have been surprised to notice in our diagnosis and treatment for the institution a great decrease in stomach and digestive ailments. We learned that two years ago, after hearing of the bad effects of aluminum cooking utensils, they had replaced them with enamel ware and iron pots. They serve three meals a day to the same people, many of whom have been there for years. We have had a very good opportunity to study the aluminum poison situation among so many, both by blood tests and other observation, and the improvement in general in two years • has been wonderful. It could not have been proven more thoroughly. Two hundred persons, given three meals a day for two years and in good health, should he proof sufficient for the use of ware other than aluminum in cooking. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Alfred W. McCann, who is quoted as “the world greatest food authority”, and who writes regularly for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span><span class="font8"> of New York city, recommends the use of aluminum. In the December 25, 1929, issue someone asked, concerning his mother avIio suffered from an ulcer of the stomach and chronic infection of the gall bladder, this question, “Is aluminum ware used for cooking purposes poisonous?” Mr. McCann’s answer was: “There has been a great deal of foolish talk about the so-called poisonous properties of aluminum cooking ware. Many articles have been sent to me on this subject. I can see nothing in any of them. Since my earliest boyhood I can'remember our aluminum cooking utensils at home. We use them constantly to this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Chas. T. Betts, of Toledo, in answering this, says, in part: “Mr. McCann has no doubt been very careful with his diet and given attention to his bowel tract. He has exercised and kept his body quite normal, Such persons, as explained by Dr. Harry Gideon Wells, pathologist of the University of Chicago, can throw off aluminum poisoning; but when persons are subnormal they will not eliminate the poison and then the 'body </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">re-absorbs</span><span class="font8"> it, which forms a continuous process of poisoning that results in the various evil effects mentioned by him under oath to our federal authorities and in his later work published in the ‘Archives of Pathology’, August, 1,929.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A letter in this connection appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> written by Dr. Betts to Mr. McCann. I will quote in part from this letter: “Many of our surgeons have taken to removing ulcers by the knife. This recently occurred with Valentino of your city, with similar results— death. It seems a shame that men like you continue to advise people that there is nothing to a potent poison like aluminum chloride and that ulcers of the stomach, gall stones, etc., are not caused by these poisons, when you could have that information at your finger tips for the asking.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He states further, “A simple test can be made to prove ‘old mother nature’. Let milk stand in an aluminum dish for twelve hours and the same amount in an enamel dish for twelve hours. Place a hventy-three-day-old puppy in the room with these two dishes and he will single out the enamel dish every time for his food. Some tiventy-three-day-old puppies seem to know more than some of our so-called ‘health writers’ because they are nearer to nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A patient who came to us some time ago suffering from severe indigestion, Mrs. L. A. C., gave us the following history: “Over a year ago I had the first signs of the dreaded disease, was examined by the Life Extension Institute here in New York, and was advised by them that I was in a serious condition and should have an X-ray that very day, as I was suffering severe pain and, had lost considerable weight. I had a feeling that my trouble was due to cooking in aluminum, so I had taken along one of my sauce pans to show the discoloration, etc. The doctor laughed and said, ‘You couldn’t find a better utensil to cook in’.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a day or so after this incident she learned, from someone who had benefited by it, the value of E. R. A. in such cases. As soon as she began treatment with us we advised her to give up all aluminum cooking utensils. You may be sure she was glad to find the cause of her stomach carcinoma. She responded to the electronic treatment splendidly and was cured in some ten weeks, and has remained well ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a recent report of the International Typographical Union, “Mortality from 1912 to 1929—the leading cause of deaths among printers/’ cancer shows by far the highest percentage. In 1912 to 1918, covering a period of six years, they report 139 deaths, a mortality rate of 33 per 100,000 members. In 1929, covering a period of one year, they report 94 deaths, the rate being 123.7. Commenting on the foregoing, Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman, consulting statistician of the Prudential Insurance Co., says, &quot;Cancer is shown to have increased continuously from an average death rate of 33 per 100,000 during 1912 to 1918 to 123.7 per 100.000 during 1929. This conforms to the general increase in cancer, but the rate of increase has been somewhat more pronounced in the population at large.” _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Quoting again from Dr. Albert Abrams: “Cancer is on the increase. During the year 1915 the cancer mortality in the United States (Continental) was over 80,000, and it has been suggested that cancer in time may exterminate the entire human race.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Dr. Albert Abrams were living today he could see that his prediction is slowly but surely coming true. As you all know from loading the papers the whole country is alarmed. E. R. A. is in its infancy, and during the past seven years lias weathered many storms, but it still lives and our methods of diagnosis and treatment have proven their value, and electronic medicine is on a firmer foundation today than it lias ever been. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oar greatest battle now is against the cancer menace, which unquestionably has increased in proportion to the increase in the use of aluminum cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 hope that in this paper I have aroused some of our physicians and friends to the great curse that besets us on every hand. If you inquire at the eating places they will proudly tell you that they use the best of aluminum ware. </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font8"> fact, it is almost impossible to go into a restaurant today and get a meal that has not been cooked in aliimimini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You can easily prove it by trying a restaurant or home meal prepared in aluminum ware yourself, the symptoms being a feeling of hunger and mild pain coming on in ten or twenty minutes after eating and followed shortly by a lazy, sluggish feeling all over, lasting sometimes for hours, and if you have a tendency toward indigestion naturally and continue to use aluminum-cooked food you will- notice heart symptoms, such as a slow<sup>7</sup> pulse, and in severe cases, unconsciousness from gas pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In case of such poison continuing* over a long period of time you will find associated with the stomach and heart symptoms an asthmatic cough sometimes severe, but regularly after eating you will notice difficulty in breathing. This condition so depletes the system that you have colds upon any slight exposure, and, as you. know, this may lead to pneumonia and tuberculosis. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We can make the test for cancer, both malignant and incipient, and the electronic treatment will relieve the disease; and now that we know that food cooked in aluminum is poisonous and makes a fertile soil for the growth of cancer, let us each do our share in suggesting to our patients that they abandon the use of aluminum ware and maintain good health. We have it in our power to help reduce the menacing cancer mortality and smite this dread enemy which now casts its shadow over this fair country of ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Uses of Solid Carbon Dioxide</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font8">OLID carbon dioxide, or “'dry ice”, as it is called, is completely transforming the problem of marketing perishable foods. It is claimed that on a sixty-mile route a two-and-one-half-ton truck will now deliver as much ice cream as could formerly be handled on a five-ton truck using water ice, and that the daily saving is $4.40 in money and two hours of time. In Springfield, Massachusetts, frozen foods cf every kind are on sale, and popular. Experiments have shown that quick freezing at very low temperature preserves the original flavor of the fruits or other frozen articles. This method expands the commercial value of the product.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Being always interested in the progress of hocus-pocus in the earth, and having a keen appreciation of the value of Latin chants as an aid in that direction, I have more or less familiarized myself with the line of ballyhoo served out to the uneducated, and pass up no chance to find new material that can be worked over into modern pulpit practice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">mentioned symbolically pictured God’s universal organization of righteousness. The promised “seed” is the offspring of that woman, or universal organization of God, and constitutes his kingdom. At the beginning God put his kingdom to the fore as the most important of all truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Years thereafter God gave Abraham and his wife the promise that by their seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. God used them to make a prophetic picture. Abraham was a picture of God himself, while his wife Sarah pictured the universal organization of Jehovah God. The promise then made further disclosed that the “seed” that would bring blessings to the nations of the earth would be produced by and through a long period of testing and suffering and. when brought forth to completeness, shall constitute the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To meet his requirements Jehovah has kept this seed shrouded in mystery for many centuries. Gradually he has unfolded this mystery to his prophets and faithful servants. He gave his Word of promise that the mystery should be completely solved and understood at the end of the world, otherwise known as “the last days”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That time has now arrived, We are at the end of the world and in the last days. That does not mean the end of the earth, because the earth abides forever. It does not mean the end of time, because time shall never end. It means the end of the long dark period</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">of time in which wickedness has predominated. It means the lifting of the veil of darkness and ignorance from the people to the end that the great light of God’s loving-kindness may shine into the mind of every man. That time is first marked by a great amount of trouble and suffering culminating in the greatest tribulation that earth has ever known. That trouble will be brief and will be the last, and it will usher in the rule of righteousness on earth. That rule of righteousness will bring the desire of every honest heart. As it progresses the earth will be filled with a happy and joyful race of people who will give honor and glory to the Most High God. To gain a knowledge of the kingdom of God is therefore of greatest importance to all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These precious and satisfying truths are set forth in the Bible, which is the Word of God. The study of the Bible is the most profound in which man can engage. Its understanding is to be preferred by far to all the gold and silver the world can produce. It enlightens the mind, makes glad the heart, and gives much strength to the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been claimed that the understanding of the Bible is limited to a few men called “the clergy”. That claim is not the truth. The Bible is given for the understanding, aid and comfort of all who love righteousness and who earnestly seek to know and to do God’s will. It is the Word of God. In Psalm 25:14 it is written: ‘ ‘ The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.”</span></p>

A godly fear is awe and veneration of the creature for .the Creator. It is man’s proper appreciation of the majesty and loving-kindness of the Most. High, the man being deeply apprehensive lest he should transgress God’s righteous and unchangeable laws. The fear of man leads one into a snare. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and leads one in the way of life. In order for man to obtain life everlasting it, is necessary for him to be brought to a knowledge of the truth. The truth of primary importance is that concerning Jehovah God. It is written in the Scriptures that ‘this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent’.—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has not pushed his name to the fore. At stated intervals he has brought his name prominently before his creation. This he has done by a demonstration of his unlimited power, which has always proved that the Devil is powerless against Jehovah when the latter deems'it proper to exercise his great power against the wicked one. At these stated intervals God has brought his name before his creation, not for a selfish reason, but for the benefit of his creatures. Unselfishness has been his motive. This is another proof that “God is love”.</span></p>

A knowledge of the Bible is now within the roach of all.. Learn its contents and be greatly blessed. “Where do we get our Bible ? ’ ’ many ask. That question shall, be answered in another address.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark12"></a>The Bible</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH God is the Creator of man. It is reasonable to expect that the Creator would give some revelation o.f himself and his purposes to man. The Bible purports to be that Bevelation. Is the Bible true, and is it the Word of God? Modernist clergymen say, “No,” and they say it is unreliable. I here submit some proof that the Bible is God’s Word of truth, and that it is the only safe guide for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The physical facts prove beyond any question that there was once a great flood of water that covered this earth. Noah was brought, over and saved from the world that was destroyed by that flood. Noah was the most important, man on earth of his time. He possessed a personal knowledge of things that no other man on earth at that time could know so well,. From the creation, of Adam to the flood was a period of 1,656 years. In those days men lived for nearly a thousand years. Adam was on earth three hundred years after the birth of Enoch., Being a good man Enoch would gather from Adam all the facts he knew concerning Eden and what occurred there. Naturally Enoch would tell those things to his son Methuselah, who was the grandfather of Noah. From Methuselah and from Lamech his father, Noah would receive all the information, then obtainable by man, the most important part of which would be that which took place in Eden and following thereafter. Noah lived 350 years after he came out of the ark. Only two years after his death. Abraham was born, and naturally Abraham would learn the history of man from Shem his father, who was the son of Noah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham, w-as the beginning of the people of Israel, otherwise called the Jew’s. He is designated the “father of the faithful”. No man could have faith without knowledge; therefore the conclusion must be that Abraham was informed of God’s dealings with man. Jacob was a grandson of Abraham, and the father of Joseph who became a mighty ruler in Egypt. Moses, an Israelite, was born in Egypt, and it is written of him that he was learned in. all the 'wisdom of Egypt, which naturally would include all the information handed down by his ancestors. It is not unusual for an American boy to learn from his father the important facts of American history. With stronger reasoning Moses would learn from his father the history of his people. Moses was eminently qualified to write the history of man. Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible. It is therefore seen that this information could easily have been handed’down from one generation to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' Enoch, Noah, Abraham and Moses were men devoted to God and naturally would obtain all the information they could concerning God’s dealings with mankind. The New Testament mentions these men as being approved by Jehovah. If we had no other proof concerning the Bible except tradition, that would be sufficient proof to warrant us in, accepting it as the history of the human race. We have much more than that, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be conceded that man is the most intelligent of earth’s creation. He has a natural tendency to keep a record of events for the benefit of himself and succeeding generations. This in itself is proof that his Creator desired man to keep such record and hence planted in his mind the inclination so to do. It logically follows that the great Creator would provide the means for keeping such record. Since it had to do with his own word and name he would supervise the keeping that it would be correct. If Jehovah had to do with the keeping of such record, then we may know that the record contains the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both tradition and the Bible agree that Moses was devoted to God and that he was sent to Egypt by Jehovah on a specific mission. He was the very kind of man that God would choose to make the record of his purposes concerning man. Moses, therefore, in writing was merely an amanuensis to write .for Jehovah. The same is properly said of all the other writers of the Bible. God directed them what to write. Concerning such, David, the faithful king of Israel, said: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. ’ ’ The spirit of God means his power, which is invisible to man but which he causes to operate upon the mind of man and to direct him what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men of old who were, faithful to God and who wrote portions of the Bible are called prophets. Concerning those men it is written, in 2 Peter 1: 21: “Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.” Those men wrote foretelling the coming of events which they did not understand and knew not about; which is proof that they were merely instruments in the hand of Jehovah used by him to write such prophecy. The prophecies written centuries ago are now being fulfilled by the facts coming to pass and which are well known to all who think seriously. That is conclusive proof that no human mind could conceive or formulate the words of the prophets, but that they were dictated by Jehovah and that those men wrote as God’s power moved upon their minds. Daniel, one of the prophets, asked God when these things would come to pass, and was told to close up </span><span class="font15">t </span><span class="font6">he book of the prophecy and seal it until the time of the end and then it would be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5o one will dispute the fact that Jesus lived and filed in Palestine about 1900 years ago. What lie said surpasses in wisdom the sayings of any other man ever on earth. He spoke with authority from Jehovah, and his words concerning the prophets were words of approval, and he quoted their words with approval. Centuries before the birth of Jesus many of those prophets wrote concerning his birth, the course of action he would take, his persecution and his death and resurrection. The admitted facts concerning Jesus fully and completely support these prophecies and show that they were correct. This proves that no human mind formulated those prophecies but that they proceeded from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus repeatedly stated that he is the Son of God and that he was sent by Jehovah from heaven to perform a work in the name of his Father and for the benefit of man. He was born, a man that he might be a witness for God and to speak the truth to men. His words recorded in John 18: 37 are these: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” It was on that same day and shortly before his death that Jesus said concerning the Bible, God’s record: “Thy word is truth.” To reject the Bible means that we must reject Jesus as the Son of God and deny the truthfulness of his testimony. Anyone who believes that Jesus was and is the great teacher must believe that the Bible is God’s Word of truth,. That part of the Bible called the New Testament was written by men who personally associated with Jesus and who learned of him and who wrote under the power and direction of the spirit of God, and what they wrote is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The original manuscripts of the Bible were kept, in the custody of God’s chosen people, the Israelites. The indisputable historical facts, aside from the Bible, show<sup>T</sup> that from the time of Ezra forward there was a rewriting or copying of the original manuscripts and that this work continued until A. D. 900. Three of these manuscripts are in existence this day. The Alexandrine manuscript, is in the. British Museum, The Sinaitie is in the library at Leningrad, and the Vatican manuscript is in the Vatican at Rome. There have been many versions and translations of these ancient manuscripts made by faithful men. It is from these that we have the Bible that we use today. Every attempt that has been made tn destroy the Bible lias failed; which is proof that God has preserved it for man’s benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the Bible is the true guide for man it is written by one of the holy prophets in Psalm 119:105: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. ’ ’ God, ’s law to man is set forth in the Bible. To know and obey that law means to walk in the way of righteousness. In Psalm 19: 7, 8 it is written: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sui-e, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The devout student may come with confidence to the. Scriptures, knowing that, these set forth the will of God concerning man and are given to man for his instruction in righteousness. Upon the Scriptures he can confidently rely. The Bible constitutes the basis of his faith in God and a knowledge thereof enables him to understand something of the great love of God toward the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A full discussion of the origin and the authenticity of the Bible is found in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font6"> The reason there is so much ignorance amongst the people concerning the Bible is because Satan the enemy of man and of God lias interfered with the people’s understanding- the truth. Satan through his agencies killed many of the men who faithfully performed their work in connection with the Bible, but not until after their work was done. Thousands of copies of the Bible were destroyed by those same evil agencies, but Satan with all of his efforts could not stop the progress of God’s unfolding purposes and the revelation of himself to the people through his Word. Being unable to stop the publication of the Bible the Devil has sought through his representatives to corrupt the meaning thereof and to put into the minds of the people an improper understanding of its text. He has used every power at his command to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah and from his pure Word of truth. For centuries many of these wonderful truths were obscure and taken away from the people. In God’s due time these pure doctrines have been restored to the honest seekers after truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is now God’s due time for the truth to be known and nothing Satan can. do or will do can prevent ths truth from being known. The time has come for the standard of Jehovah to be lifted up, that the people may know which way to go. This standard is found in the Bible. Around this divine standard the right-•eous and truly honest-hearted will rally. The tide of truth is rising higher and higher, and will continue so to rise until it has filled the whole earth as the waters fill the deep. All this shall be to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time has come for Jehovah to make known his name in the earth, and he will make this known through his Word and through the manifestation of his power. And be it noted that the truth does not belong to any man. It is God’s truth. God has used men or human instruments at different times for his o-wn purposes and to his glory, but the truth has always been and always will be Jehovah’s. The Bible is his Word of truth given to guide those who seek righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark14"></a>S a</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH GOD did not create Satan. He did create Lucifer, and because of Lucifer’s rebellion and extreme wickedness God gave him four names, to wit: Satan, which means opposer of righteousness; Devil, which means slanderer of all who do right; Dragon, which means the one that devours the good; and Serpent, which means the great deceiver. The history of that wicked one is briefly this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God made the earth as the habitation for his creature man he assembled his heavenly creatures before him. Among the ones present, were the Logos and Lucifer, which two were designated “the morning stars”. Doubtless God disclosed to these mighty creatures thus assembled his purpose to create man and put him on earth and to give him dominion over his other creation of earth. That information called forth a song of praise to Jehovah. The Bible record is that these two &quot;morning stars” sang together and all the hosts of God shouted for joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God created man and placed him in the paradise of Eden he made man a part of Lucifer’s organization, God appointed Lucifer as man’s overseer or overlord. Lucifer must have been a very beautiful as well as a powerful creature. God by his prophet Ezekiel, in the twenty-eighth chapter, gives a description of Lucifer in these words: ‘ ‘ Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering. . . , Thou art the anointed cherub that</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark16"></a>a n</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. . . . Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom, by reason of thy brightness.” This proves that Lucifer was a high official in the great organization of God and was an overseer of one part of God’s universal organization. “Iniquity” means lawlessness; and this scripture shows that Lucifer became lawless, or rebelled against God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The perfect man was in Eden, and Lucifer was there. Man being a part of his organization and under his lordship, the duty devolved upon Lucifer to safeguard man’s interest and aid him to obey rather than to disobey God. Lucifer knew that God had delegated to man the power to produce a race of people that in time would fill the earth, and that all<sup>1</sup> this creation would worship Jehovah God. By his prophet Isaiah, in the fourteenth, chapter, Jehovah says: “0 Lucifer, son of the morning! . .. Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is proof of Lucifer’s ambition to possess that which God had not given him and to have the worship of creatures, and that he determined to have it for himself. He set about to carry out his ambitious desire, and in doing so he resorted to lying, fraud and murder and, above all, he was guilty of treason and rebellion, against God. His first move was to alienate man from God, and this he began to do by his subtle influence over Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He knew that God had said to man that ‘if you eat of this forbidden fruit you shall surely die’. Being reminded of this statement by Eve, he replied to her: ‘Ton shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day you eat of that fruit you shall be as wise as gods.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His argument was like this: ‘If man cats of that fruit in violation of God’s law and God does kill him, that will prove that God’s creature is imperfect, and lienee God’s word unreliable, and that he cannot make a man that will maintain his integrity, and therefore God could not afford to kill man. On the other hand, </span><span class="font15">if </span><span class="font6">man sinned and God did not kill him, that would prove God a liar, because he said that he would kill him, and therefore none of his creatures would believe him.’ Lucifer thus reasoned that in any event he would ba able to turn the major portion of creation away from God and these he would have for himself and for his own worship. Eve fell under the false reasoning and broke God's law. When Adam, learned </span><span class="font15">i </span><span class="font6">hat Eve had violated the law and still lived he readi</span><span class="font15">ly </span><span class="font6">and willingly joined in the rebellion against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of this rebellion God sentenced man to death and expelled him from Eden. lie also announced ills purpose that in due time he would destroy Lucifer, whom he now named Satan, the Devil. From that time until now Satan has been the violent opposer of God, and man’s worst enemy. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God could have killed Satan immediately, of course. He could have killed man. immediately and started another race. His wisdom directed that he take the course he did take. Satan denied that Jehovah God is supreme and that Ills word is true. Had God killed Satan, at once, that would have proven that the power of God is supreme, but .the opportunity to prove the truthfulness of God’s word would have been absent. At the time of the tragedy in Eden God had given his word that he would bring forth a “seed” which, would destroy Satan and that the ‘ ‘ seed ’ ’ would be taken from amongst men. Satan knew that God would not select anyone who would be unfaithful to him, and knowing that all men on earth are imperfect he defied God to find a man that would prove faithful to God under the most severe test. Time was therefore required to demonstrate the truthfulness of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the issue should be decided in Satan’s favor, then all creation would turn against God. Should the issue be decided on God’s side that would prove to all creation that God is supreme, his word is true, that Satan is a liar, and that life and blessings must come from God alone. In due time the issue will be decided in favor of Jehovah. But until that time God will permit Satan to put forth every possible effort to sustain his own contention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the history of man Satan began to organize men into forms of government, that he might more fully control them. To accomplish that purpose he exercised his power over men and induced them to form an. organization with Nimrod as the leader of the people. Nimrod was a tool of Satan, and his organization belonged to Satan. That organization was called “Babylon”, which from Satan’s viewpoint meant the “gate to god”. Evidently his purpose was to induce the people to believe that the way to their god (Satan) was by and through this organization of which Nimrod was the visible head. From God’s viewpoint the name “Babylon” meant ‘confusion’, because after the building of the tower of Babel God demonstrated his power to the people by confusing their language. That is the reason there are so many different languages spoken amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan’s fixed policy is to employ fraud, deceit and. lying to accomplish his purpose of bringing reproach upon God and to thereby turn the people away from God. For this reason, in his organization there are, three elements or governing factors, to w<sup>r</sup>it, the religious, the political, and the commercial. In Babylon the religious element was in control, and the people were dominated by a false religion. Since then Satan has organized other world powers, and in all of them these three elements appear. The political element of the governments makes and enforces the laws. The commercial clement controls the business or commerce ; and the religious element of the organization lends a sanctimonious air thereto and claims that the entire organization exists and operates by divine power. This is Satan’s chief method of practicing fraud upon the people. By his deceptive operations Satan blinds the people to the truth. For this reason it is written in the Scriptures, in 2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4, that Satan, the god of this world, blinds the rain ds of men, lest the Light of truth should appear unto them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that from time immemorial all religious organizations have had some particular man who appeared as leader and to whom great honor has been given. After his death the memory of that man is revered, and often worshiped. This is another subtle -means of Satan to turn the people away from. God and cause mankind to forsake the Creator by worshiping the creature. Throughout all these centuries God has had a few men on earth who have held fast their integrity and faithfully served him. By nature these men have been no better than other men, but they have had faith, in God’s Word and have refused to yield to the deceptions of Satan. Their faithfulness and devotion to God has brought to them Jehovah’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The &quot;seed” God promised to raise up and through which his name shall be vindicated is The Christ. The faithful men who have followed in the footsteps of Jesus Christ shall be of that &quot;seed” according to the promise that God gave, and will be used for his purposes. During the past fifteen centuries Satan has fraudulently induced religious leaders to believe that their duty is to convert the world and get men into their churches. Satan’s real purpose has been to turn the mind of the people away from God’s kingdom. God has not been attempting to convert any part of the world, nor to get anyone into heaven. He has merely had his truth placed before men in order that those who prefer to stand firmly on his side may do so. In his due time he will have selected every one that will be of The Christ, and then God will put his kingdom in full control of earth’s affairs. Then, and not until then, will the world be converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first great act of God’s kingdom under Christ that will be seen by the people will be the destruction of the wicked organization of this world which is under the control of Satan. There is an abundance of Scriptural proof as well as proof outside of the Scriptures that God’s kingdom is at hand and that within a short time Satan’s organization will be completely destroyed. Then all hindrances will be removed and the people will have a full and fair opportunity to know and to understand that Jehovah is the only true God, that his word is true, and that his name is worthy of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God’s kingdom takes full sway, never again will Satan have control of the people. All the wicked God will destroy. All the obedient ones of mankind God will fully restore to health and give them life everlasting in happiness. The tvork of Jehovah God will fully demonstrate to all that he is supreme in power, perfect in wisdom, and exact in justice, and that he is the very embodiment of love or unselfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because we are today entering that great period of transition from the old to the new world, a knowledge of the truth is of vital importance to all. The people now need to study the Bible together with such helps as have been provided to understand it. Every one who will be free from the oppressive hand of the enemy must have a knowledge of the truth; and the truth of the salvation of man is found only in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* * # ♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A Possible Explanation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pondering as to what possible motive the clergy of St. Petersburg could have for not wishing the people of their city to hear what Judge Rutherford has to say on the above and kindred topics, an idea presents itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of these clergy may have heard /A’ his advanced studies in the book of The Revelation; and may not like what he has ha'd to say in his work </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> Book Two, Chapter 10, on “Hypocrisy Exposed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In that chapter Judge Rutherford has quoted many, many scriptures and made applications to the Pharisees, Sadducees, popes, cardinals, doctors of divinity, right reverends, reverends and the principals of their flock. It makes hard reading for those that have only taken their first lessons in New Testament Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But because Judge Rutherford has had considerable to say in his book about the clergy of today, their loving titles, and loving, as in Jesus’ day, to be seen of men, and to make long prayers, standing in public places, or by radio, is that any reason why those who really love the simple truth of God’s Word should be deprived of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">None can deny that Judge Rutherford is rigid in claiming that hypocrisy is the greatest crime committed against God and deserves the greatest punishment. If the clergy of today, and the principal of the flock, are the greatest hypocrites on earth, and if Jesus himself would say the same thing’ today if He were here in the flesh, why should any object because Judge Rutherford has said the same thing in a book? And how did the “ministers” of St. Petersburg know<sup>T</sup> for sure that having said these truths in a book he 'would also say them over the air? The answer is that they could not have known, but it is likely that they feared he would. But if it is the truth, why not let him tell it, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Jesus thought that in His day the scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites made their converts twice as bad when they got through with them as when they started with them, because they made worse hypocrites of them, could not Judge Rutherford be given a chance, in a book, to point out that the same thing- is taking place today, without their trying to rule him off the air ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppose now’ that Judge Rutherford has evidence that some of these clergymen, the loudest shouters for prohibition, have plenty of Avine in their cellars. Must he keep silent about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppose he knows that the sticklers for Sabbath observance have in many places tried to prevent honest and faithful children of God from preaching the truth on that day. What then? Must he keep still?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is there any reason why Judge Rutherford, knowing what Jesus said about some who gar-wished the tombs of the prophets, should avoid mentioning those today who have so much to say at the tombs of the boys that, were done to death in the World War!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Must lie keep still when the Bible speaks of the religious leaders of our day as men that are “lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that- are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people of the land are entitled to the truth. If the clergy object to what is being said, that is the best evidence that they are deceiving the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why do not the clergymen give answer to the questions themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have no fight against men, but our fight is against deception and falsehood, bmI. our only purpose is to aid the people in understanding what is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The law says that radio stations should broadcast that which is of public interest, convenience and necessity. The truth comes clearly within this provision. It is a necessity for the people to have the truth. It is convenient for them to have the truth, because it builds them up in the right way. It is of public interest because it shows the people the reason for the present depressed times and what is the remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Extracts from Interesting Letters</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font8">ANY of our readers will be greatly interested in the following reports from various sections of the country showing how the electrical transcriptions of Judge Rutherford’s lectures on Bible topics are being received by the public. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bangor, Me. Radio station WLBZ put on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font6"> program this morning, 9:45 to 10:00, using the electrical transcription. We were surprised to hear it come in so clear and natural, just as though the speaker were in the room. When I first heard that the chain broadcast was to bo‘ discontinued and these records put on I was disappointed and thought programs would be greatly inferior in quality, etc.; but since listening to the first broadcast I am compelled to change my mind, and I now think that this will bo quite the program. The great increase in stations, and doing away with wire connection expense, is to be greatly desired. I also think more people will listen to a 15-minute talk than to a 30- to 45-minute talk. Time will tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reading, Pa. The electrical transcriptions of Judge Rutherford’s lectures are simply wonderful! They come in very clear and natural over the Reading station WRAW. Not only is Mr. Raymond Gaul, the station announcer, a credit to the station, but his clear and earnest expression cannot help but add weight to these wonderful lectures. Using the newspaper cut of Judge Rutherford, we advertised </span><span class="font15">this </span><span class="font6">series of lectures in both morning and evening papers here. We feel confident that there will be a much larger number listening in than ever before and that this will increase the demand for books, thus spreading truth to the glory of Jehovah. You can also see by the reports of our official “listeners” that the. first two programs, at least, came in. 100 percent. So, all together, we pronounce these, programs a great success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Roanoke, Va. This is to advise that the new radio program over WDBJ was carried out nicely over December 7 10:00 to 10:15 a. m. period as per arrangement. This program was heard by many people in Roanoke, and also at various distances from Roanoke as well. It was highly satisfactory in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coldwater, N. Y. I have been privileged to listen in to the first record lecture of Judge Rutherford, in Rochester, N. Y. How it rejoiced my heart! It surely brought tears of joy. May the Lord’s blessing rest richly upon this new phase of the work, and. continue until the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the earth as the waters cover the great deep. It makes me feel more anxious to go forth with the message from door to door, The announcement following the record, concerning Judge Rutherford and his work, and regarding the books, was given just splendidly. If it was the regular announcer here in Rochester, he gave it as though he believed what lie said. It does not seem as if it could have been given any better. Praise the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bismarck, N. D. What a joy to hear Judge Rutherford’s voice so distinctly and clear over the air this morning! Meyer broadcasting station surely handled it very nicely, giving a. little music before and after. Everything came in very clear and distinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Miami, Fla. The radio message last Sunday was fine, both, in content and rendition. Judge .Rutherford’s voice was very pleasing. Surely all listeners were blessed and should find some point to greatly interest them in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pushing the Wrong Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8">N AN address at Huron City, Michigan, Prof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">William. Lyon Phelps, of Yale University, said some good things. One of these was that “Jesus wanted the kingdom of God on earth more than anything else. He wanted the world filled with unselfish men and women. Above all things Jesus hated hypocrisy, a cold heart and calculating selfishness. All events of history point to the fact that the kingdom of God is at hand”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the professor spoiled it all when lie said additionally that 'the kingdom of God would soon be established on earth if churches would make it the principal platform in their world. The churches, practically all of them, are strong for war in this life and “hell” in the next, and look upon these lying aggregations of politicians and plutocrats that have filled the world with machine guns, cannons, battleships, submarines, flame throwers, gas bombs, chaplains, tanks and zeppelins as parts and parcels of that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If he had turned his statement the other way around and said that if the churches 'would have the decency to quit work altogether, and let the truth have a chance, in their absence, to approach the people under favorable conditions, the work of the kingdom of God, notv active in the earth, would be greatly assisted. The professor has the kingdom of Satan mixed up in his mind with the kingdom of God. The two are as far apart as the East and the West.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">A Scheme for Dishonoring God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font8">HAT the average city mission is a scheme for dishonoring God, and causing the poor and downtrodden to hate Him instead of love Him, and that it is therefore most emphatically a part of the Devil’s organization, seems well illustrated in the following article clipped from the illustrated </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Detroit Daily</span><span class="font8"> of November 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beneath a series of streamer headlines announcing in glaring letters, “Rescue Den Reeks with Filth; Christianity Used as Mask for Tortures; Sleepless are Clubbed into Wakefulness; Rescue Mission Forces Christianity Down Hungry Outcasts’ Throats”, appeared this expose of the method by which some manage to find employment for themselves in a job of which it would seem that even the Devil himself would be ashamed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Filthy, pestilence-spreading “Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unwashed men reeking with the fetid odor of sweat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matted hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lice. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All in one clot of humanity,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Mission'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last, night there were 200 men in a small building on Rivard st., between Jefferson and Larned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These men had tramped the streets all day searching in vain for work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They sat in hopeless silence while a half dozen preachers harangued them from the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every few moments they were called on to rise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of them didn’t rise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A husky usher came along the aisle and shook him until his teeth rattled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next time he rose.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Three hours of this <sub>( 5</sub> for a bowl of soup and a roll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The men were tired and half starved. They were not allowed to sleep or to even nod. Eagle-eyed ushers paced the aisles, and the men eyed them with the bitter stare of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Detroit City Rescue Mission Number 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Stuckey in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Supported by contributions, most of which according to Stuckey, come from down town business men and stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men begging on the streets in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The drug store adjoining forced to call on the police for constant protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No toilet facilities. No soap. No running water. Only scores of unwashed men who are forced to sit through-three hours of preaching for a bowl of soup. Then another half hour for the privilege of sleeping on the hard pews which line the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Forced Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Detroit board of health has already complained against this outrage perpetrated on humanity in the name of “Christianity.” These gospel mongers who force a man to say “I’m saved,” before they allow him his ration of soup and bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religion by force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is the mission principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tired men forced to keep their eyes open and their bodies alert to go through a routine which is meaningless—to listen to words that blur and rumble in their numbed brains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You can’t make a good Christian of a man with a bad liver,” Henry Ward Beecher said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Rescue Mission seeks to convert men with empty stomachs and tired, pain-racked bodies.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">FEBRtAUY tS, 1«J31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One man last night dropped off to sleep after a particularly long standing session. He moaned in his dreams.<sub>::</sub> The usher' started <sub>:</sub> for the seat. . Qf„the, noise, but other men in the line, knowing what was coming, Wakened the sleeper. The men seek to protect each other from the gaze of the watchful wardens who constantly crane their necks for a glimpse of a sleeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a Little Grub</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prayer. More prayer. Ahvays standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4 4</sup> Jesus saves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is the title on the sign board outside the mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the Jesus of this institution saves only standing men. Those who would sleep after a day of heartbreaking disappointment arc lost unless the watchful usher prods them to their feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the scanty meal, or before it, the men can go to the filthy lavatories. In the summer they go down to the river to wash their hands and faces; In the winter they simply don’t wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cleanliness is next to godliness. Did Reverend Stuckey ever hear that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Godliness is the supreme aim of the Rescue Mission. For a bowl of soup and a roll they seek to buy men's souls—if those unfortunate men -still have souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a night- on a hard, wooden pew, they ask a man to believe in their God and accept their Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The men do it—or they say they do—and eat the soup and 'bread. And in their hearts they revile the system that brings them to abject groveling that they may obtain enough food to keep body and soul together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These men are being victimized by an organization that takes a terrific toll of their strength each nighr lor their ration of food. Strength they need to seek work is spent in. the rising, sitting, rising, standing routine which saps their energy for three-hour stretches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christianity is being robbed of whatever convert-, it might make from these hordes who come and pay with their meager strength for food. They will avoid this thing when they are able—avoid It like a pestilence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rescue Mission Number 2 has become a threat to the community which houses it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spreading disease through, the filthy practice of allowing men to sleep side by side in their clothing, unwashed, even though they want to be clean, it is a threat to the health standards of Detroit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are laws which regulate the sanitary conditions of places where men are allowed to congregate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No other organization could get by with, such fiilli to convert men to their beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only the guise of Christianity throws the mantle of impregnability around this mission.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font3">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it is the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that the kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel of the kingdom must he preached.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ABOMINATIONS IN CHRISTENDOM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.”—Ezek. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH makes it clearly to appear in his Word that he gives fair and full warning to the workers of iniquity before he inflicts upon such his judgment. He sent Noah to give warning of the flood. He sent Moses to give warning to the ruler of Egypt. He sent his prophets to give warning to Jerusalem of his purpose to destroy that city. Knowing that these things foreshadow the destruction of the wicked organization that rules the world, and particularly have reference to Christendom, should we not expect to find in the Scriptures that Jehovah has given command that notice of warning must be served upon Christendom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* One of the titles which Jehovah gave to his beloved Son is “ The Son of man “ The Son of man ” is God’s ‘elect servant’. (Isa. 42:1) When Jehovah sent Jesus to his temple he sent him for judgment and to select out the approved ones that these might ‘offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness’. (Mal. 3:1-3) Such offering in righteousness means full and complete devotion to Jehovah, and therefore full obedience to his commandments. There could be no faithful obedience on the part of those in the covenant without bearing testimony to the world of and concerning Jehovah’s purposes. The approved ones selected at the temple by Jesus Christ are designated collectively as the “faithful and wise servant ’ ’ to whom are committed the kingdom interests, which means the giving of the testimony that was committed first to Jesus Christ. Such class is made a part of God’s “ servant ’ ’, and therefore when the Lord addresses Ezekiel by the title “son of man” it is certain that Ezekiel was used to foreshadow that class known as the “faithful and wise servant”. If God’s purpose is to give warning to Christendom, it reasonably follows that he would use this people who compose the “servant” class to do that work. The Scriptures abundantly support that conclusion. That being true, there is a responsibility resting upon the “servant” class, otherwise called the remnant, that cannot be avoided. Concerning this Jehovah says: “When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. ’ ’—Ezek. 3:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> It should be expected that we would find a correspondency between Ezekiel and the work he did and that to be done by the class whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, because we know that these things came to pass by God’s will to foreshadow greater things to come to pass in the future days. It was in the year 617 B. C. that Ezekiel, together with other Israelites, was carried away as captive to Babylon. (2 Ki. 24:15,16) The fact that God used Ezekiel to write down the prophecy foretelling his purposes upon Jerusalem, the unfaithful city, proves that Ezekiel was not taken captive because of any wrong that he had done, but that God permitted him to be taken into captivity to be used to accomplish his own purposes. During the World War many of God’s children were taken captive by Satan’s organization, quite a number of them incarcerated behind prison bars; and the fact that these have been permitted to serve God since that time is proof that they were not taken because of any wrongdoing on their part, but because God would use these circumstances to accomplish his own purposes. Some who want an excuse for fault-finding have stated that brethren were in prison during the war because of meddling in affairs that were not theirs. This is wholly unsupported by the Scriptures and by the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The captivity of God’s people began in 1914, when the World War put restraint upon many of the consecrated. By the end of 1918 God’s covenant people on earth who were devoted to him were practically all in captivity because the work was stopped by the agents of Babylon. While some were actually behind prison bars, others were as effectually restrained, almost, so far as their work was concerned. In 1919 the work of the Lord by his covenant people was again revived. The year 617 B. C., therefore, corresponds with 1914, and the year 612 B. C. corresponds with the year 1919 (A. D.). Five years after Ezekiel’s captivity God began to use him to prophesy. Ezekiel was then thirty years of age, that being the age required</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">for one to perform the duties in the priest’s office. While we have no way of definitely fixing the date, the circumstances seem to indicate that those who were faithful, upon the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918, were anointed to serve in the priestly office by 1919, when the work in the field was resumed. Jehovah used Ezekiel as his witness to the Babylonian captives, that is, the Jews in Babylon, and against the corrupt religionists of the Jews in particular. Correspondingly, therefore, Ezekiel foreshadows that class that would be used to give testimony to God’s people in captivity and to the corrupt religionists who are the workers of iniquity. Ezekiel’s first vision was given him by Jehovah in the fifth year after his captivity began. At the corresponding date, to wit, 1919, God’s people learned that there was a work yet to be done, which work was foreshadowed by the Prophet Elisha; and they began to proclaim God’s message to this end. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4"> August, 1919) Christ Jesus was then at Jehovah’s temple for judgment, and “the temple in heaven was open’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* It seems reasonably to follow that Jehovah God will give his people on earth some understanding of his prophetic Word relating to the serving of notice upon the workers of iniquity and giving warning to all such before that service work is completed. It was after the coming of the Lord to his temple that God revealed to his people that hideous organization that Satan has builded up, and also disclosed to them that such organization is made up of three elements, to wit, commercial, political and religious. They have also been made to understand that “organized Christianity” is the most hypocritical and the wickedest part of the religious elements that rule the world. Those of the temple class would see and do see and appreciate these things; but it is hardly to be expected that those who do not believe that the Lord came to his temple in 1918, and is there now, would see them; and surely they would not appreciate them at all. There are a number of people today claiming to be consecrated to God and in the covenant for the kingdom who have been favored with a knowledge of present truth and yet who deny that the Lord Jesus Christ is at his temple, and who have no vision of Satan’s organization; nor have they any vision of God’s organization. This would explain not only why they refuse to have any part in giving testimony against the corrupt religionists and other portions of Satan’s organization, but also why they oppose those who are actually engaged in giving that testimony. For some time after the coming of the Lord to his temple for judgment elders and others in the ecclesias who claim consecration, and who now oppose the work of giving testimony, sat in the same assembly with the faithful witnesses and heard discussed matters concerning the temple of God, but did not understand and did not appreciate the same.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">• Those of the consecrated who have been favored with a vision of the purposes of Christ at the temple of God and who appreciate the same may now well realize that there rests upon them a great responsibility to be obedient to God and to give warning as he has directed. A refusal to give such testimony of warning would put such in great jeopardy. To aid them in doing the work thus assigned to them by the Lord those things that have long been a secret and mystery hid in the prophecies Jehovah is now unfolding to his people. In the eighth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy Jehovah makes known to his anointed ones some of the hideous abominations that are done in his name. Therefore the obligation is laid upon his “servant” class to give notice and warning of God’s purpose concerning such abominations and of his judgments telling of their destruction. There seem to be some now who continue to associate with those who are the faithful witnesses, but who do not appreciate that there is any responsibility upon them to do anything toward giving the notice of warning. Some of these even express themselves as believing that little or nothing should be said about Satan’s organization. God caused the prophecies to be written for the aid and comfort of those who love him and who should be on the earth at the end of the world, and we should expect, therefore, to find instruction and consolation therein at the present time. To this end the Lord discloses to his people the hideous things of Satan’s organization, and particularly in Christendom, to the end that they might have an appreciation of why they are giving warning to those who defame Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> Jehovah has favored his covenant people with a knowledge of his purposes and has laid upon the leaders of each ecclesia the obligation of feeding and instructing the flock of God in his Word. (1 Pet. 5:2) The Lord is using and has used </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower </span><span class="font4">from its foundation as his channel of communication to and between his people; and during the past few years </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> has repeatedly called attention to Satan’s wicked organization. In the face of all this, however, there have been in the ecclesias certain elders wise in their own minds who have not been persuaded that the Devil has an organization at all. ' At least, ’ say they, ‘ we should go easy and say nothing about the preachers and their allies in the organization that controls the world. ’ The policy of these elders is to speak softly that even the clergy might be won over to the Lord’s side. Some of the weaker ones in the ecclesias who desire to hear nothing against the clergy say in substance: “Our oldest elders, who are most fully developed in the Lord, say nothing about the Devil’s organization; then why should these younger ones, who have recently been brought to a knowledge of the truth, say anything against them and others of the organization of this world?” The Society has been severely criticized because of the plain statements made in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> and in its other publications concerning Satan’s organization. These publications, however, must tell the truth or else they will cease to be used by the Lord. Now let those who have objected to any speech or publication about Satan’s organization and the various elements thereof give consideration to the eighth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy. If they believe what the Scriptures say, and if they understand the commission God has given to his covenant people, then let them take the proper attitude toward Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Ezekiel began to prophesy in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, which corresponds with the year 1919 (A. D.). It was one year and two months later that the events in the eighth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy came to pass. This marks the beginning of a new vision and series of prophecies by Ezekiel. At the time when this prophecy began to have its final fulfilment, the Lord Jesus Christ was in the temple of Jehovah. He inspects the defiled “organized Christianity”, so called, and points out to the “faithful servant” class, pictured by Ezekiel, the conditions there found, and the “servant” class is enabled to understand and appreciate the same as never before. As the vision appeared to Ezekiel, so the “faithful servant” class in every instance has seen that there is and has been the worship of the creature rather than the Creator. Such is Devil-worship, the Devil’s method of fraudulently claiming to worship God, the purpose being to turn man away from Jehovah. An officer of Jehovah appeared in the name and by the power of Jehovah God and lifted Ezekiel up and showed him how the temple had been defiled. The fulfilment of this is that God through his duly constituted officers lifted up the “faithful servant” class, and showed that class how Satan had reproached and defamed God’s name. “And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward at the gate of the altar, this image of jealousy in the entry. ” (8:3-5) Thus the Lord lifted up the faithful anointed “servant” class between earth and heaven and brought them in vision to Jerusalem, the heavenly organization, to the door of the inner gate of the temple that looks toward the north from which divine authority and judgment proceed, and there appeared the image of jealousy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">• The Devil is the very image or personification ,of jealousy and envy. He was jealous and envious of the worship given by man to Jehovah and coveted the same. Therefore Satan said: “ I will be like the Most High.” Everything that God has done for human salvation the Devil has tried to imitate, out of jealousy and for the purpose of deceit, to draw men away from Jehovah God. The Devil is the mimic god and vigorously endeavors to turn all creatures away from Jehovah and from the truth. This mimic or image provokes to jealousy. In giving his law to Israel God said: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. ... I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.” (Ex. 20: 3-5) That law was not given for Jehovah’s benefit, but was declared for the benefit of Israel and all who thereafter should come to a knowledge of God. All life proceeds from Jehovah, whereas Satan is the one who has unrighteously taken life. Envying the honor and glory that is properly bestowed upon Jehovah by his creatures, and coveting that honor and glory for himself, Satan has resorted to all manner of crime to turn creatures away from God. For the benefit of creation and for his own honor and glory, and that his creatures might know him and live, Jehovah God must in his own due time vindicate his name against this jealous one. All the images that have been reared up for the purpose of being worshiped were reared up by the Devil, and therefore the Devil is “the image of jealousy”. The truth discloses the true situation, that man may have the opportunity to know God and know the way to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup>As the image of jealousy seen by Ezekiel depicted the Devil, so the organization of the Devil on the earth is the true image of the Devil, morally, mentally, and in practice. Today God’s “faithful servant” class sees “the abomination that maketh desolate”, spoken of by Daniel the prophet and by the Lord Jesus Christ, standing in the holy place. (Matt. 24:15) It is the Devil’s product, his organization, and it is “the image of the beast”, the League of Nations. It has its seat in the holy place of organized religion which calls itself by the holy name of God and claims to be the favored one of Jehovah God; and thus the name of Jehovah is reproached and desecrated. Its prime promoters and chief supporters are the nations which call themselves “Christian nations”. “The image of jealousy” and the League of Nations, the product and offspring of the Devil, is anti-kingdom of God. All who support it, either actively or passively, put themselves in a position antagonistic to the kingdom of God. Those who profess to be consecrated to God and who hold that “the higher powers” means the ruling powers of this world deceive themselves and deceive others. Many of the elders of the ecclesias or Bible classes insist that “the higher powers”, described by the apostle in Romans thirteen, means the ruling powers of this world. Being selfish, they have become blind to the revelation of God’s truth. “God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.” (2 Thess. 2:11) These also fail to see the organization of Jehovah, and therefore fail to appreciate the fact that the kingdom is at hand. They do not see the kingdom of God, and therefore refuse to take a stand for it. They insist on treading softly so far as the Devil and his organization are concerned, and are led in the way of outer darkness; and, as the Scriptures declare, the same fate awaits them that God has provided for the Devil. They are anti-kingdom of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The elders, leaders, or clergymen of Christendom, practically as a unit support the League of Nations and falsely claim that the abominable thing is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth, and these likewise insist that “the powers that be” are the kingdoms of this world, which the Lord plainly declares constitute the visible organization of the Devil. Anyone who is devoted to the Lord and who receives the Lord’s approval must take his stand unequivocally on Jehovah’s side and speak the truth concerning Satan’s organization and Jehovah’s organization, to the end that he might have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Then the officer of the Lord in charge of Ezekiel continues the inspection, and Ezekiel sees more abominations. “And he brought me to the door of the court [of the temple]; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall; and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients [elders] of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.” (8:7-11) The abominable beasts and idols portrayed upon the wall of the house or temple of the Israelites foreshadowed the abominable things that have been brought into professed “Christianity” which claims to be the temple of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The modernist clergy, while claiming to be ministers of God, are the leaders and teachers of evolution and are guilty of ancestor worship, in this, that they claim that ‘ ‘ every form of creeping things ” or “ abominable beasts” preceded man on the earth, and that these are man’s ancestors or blood relatives. These clergymen hold on to their jobs and draw their pay from the people on the pretext of being interpreters of the Word of God, and they occupy so-called “Christian pulpits”. In their discourses they take a Bible text as a pretext to teach evolution. They read their text and get away from it immediately. These elders or leaders, otherwise called “clergymen” of “organized Christianity”, burn incense in the house which they call the house of the Lord, their church, while they busy themselves in turning the people away from God and from the Bible. Therefore in the picture each one is shown with a censer in his hand with incense round about. They deny the existence of the supreme, allwise God, the Creator of heaven and earth. They are so wise in their own conceits that they believe they can teach what they will and that the people will not understand them and that no one will see them. Therefore says the Lord to Ezekiel: “Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients [elders] of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth.”— 8:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> These distinguished clergymen, wise in their own conceit, are, in the language of God’s Word, fools. They say: ‘There is nothing to show that God made the earth and its creatures,’ and they tell the people that ‘the Bible account thereof is mere nonsense and imaginations of unlearned men’. They laugh at the statement: ‘Your Father in heaven seeth in secret.’ They are hypocrites of the worst kind, because they claim to represent God and yet they deny God and, in fact, represent the Devil and defame and desecrate God’s holy name. Anyone who is a child of the Lord and in the covenant for the kingdom, and who would put on the “soft pedal” concerning such men, and fail to point out that they are the Devil’s servants, would be unfaithful to God and to his covenant. The “faithful servant” class, each one of which will do his duty, will tell the truth, that God’s truth may sweep away these hiding places of lies, that the glory of the Lord may be seen by those who love righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The inspection continued, and more abominations were seen by the Prophet Ezekiel; and what Ezekiel saw foreshadowed what the “faithful servant” or remnant would see shortly preceding Armageddon or the destruction of Christendom. “He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.” (8:13,14) Tammuz was the name of a Phoenician god, which the Devil had provided, of course, with which to deceive the people. Whatever the Tammuz represented, it is certain that women adored and idolized it and worshiped the creature and ignored the Creator, and that death overtook it, and they wept bitterly. This fits the fundamentalists, who worship their church organizations and give no heed to the kingdom of God under Christ. They profess to be defenders of the Word of God and the followers of Christ Jesus, but their devotion is entirely to their organization, which Tammuz fitly represents. These church organizations are patronized chiefly by women. Their men look upon religion as taught in the orthodox churches as being fit only for women and children and weak-minded persons. The women well pictured the Epworth League workers, the managers of church affairs, and like organizations within the church, which they idolize and worship because they are attached to the church. Those represented by the women have for some time seen the steady decline of their church organization, and they weep because the church is dying or practically dead and they know that soon it must die. They believe that with the passing away of these churches Prohibition, and morality and human reformation, will die also and that the entire world will be lost. They pretend to make much over Jesus, who died, but they have no time for nor interest in the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ as the means of vindicating and honoring Jehovah God’s name and for the blessing and uplift of the human race. The second coming of Christ and the establishment of his kingdom does not interest them. Their interest is centered in doing the work of their organization. They think that, because some self-constituted “wise” men have said that ‘the church must clothe the earth in the moral achievements of man, so that Christ can come’, the work of the church therefore is to carry out this announced slogan and clean up the world. And now, seeing that the church is in a dying condition, and is practically dead, they weep and wail. They look to the clergy of their church to clean up and save the world, and the clergy go to the political rulers and ask for instruction as to what they shall do to accomplish this purpose. Hence the members of their church look upon their organization as dying and almost dead. The fundamentalists, while claiming to support the Bible, ignore every part of it with reference to God’s kingdom and ally themselves with this world and are led by the god of these world powers, the Devil. They are deceived, to be sure; and this statement is made here because it is a fact, and in order that those of good will may get their eyes open to a realization of the facts. The preachers themselves have ‘become as women’. They sense the end of their organization, and they weep. All of them have great cause to weep, because they have drawn near the Lord with their mouths while their hearts are far removed from him and now no more is the blessing of the Lord with them. They have allied themselves with Satan’s organization and looked to the League of Nations, the Epworth League, and other leagues and peace pacts, to accomplish the desired end of reformation and upbuilding of the human race. They are therefore an abomination in the sight of the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The inspection continues and more abominations are exhibited to Ezekiel; and hence more abominations are revealed to the temple class. “Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, 0 son of man? Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.” (8:15) It is a well known fact that in modern times human intellectuality or the wisdom of this world is placed before and above the worship of Jehovah God. The clergy, acting as Satan’s instruments, and hypocritically claiming to be God’s representatives, are chiefly responsible for this condition in the nations called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. From the pulpits discourses are regularly delivered, not in explanation of the Bible, but upon what is called “scientific matters”, and the Word of the Lord is ignored. “And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house [the temple]; and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar [the place of sacrifice, and near the location of the laver, which symbolizes the Word of God by which one is made clean and which is by these ignored], were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.”—8:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> In this modern day, called by the self-wise “the brain age”, young men are required to take a course in the secular colleges and there have all faith in God and his Word destroyed, before they are admitted to the theological seminary. By the time they have finished their education in the theological seminary and are turned out for preachers, and labeled as such, although they occupy a place in a church called the house of the Lord, their worship is of the creature and to the utter disregard of the Creator. Modern colleges and theological seminaries are therefore mere hatcheries of infidelity. It is these worshipers of so-called intellectual power and great men and their institutions that are put forth as the saviors and deliverers of the world. These modern “brain-age” men, together with their institutions, are held forth to the people as the “sunlight of the world”. As Ezekiel was shown this condition in the temple, even so the class whom he represented, God’s faithful anointed ones, had a vision thereof in fact and so declared themselves. On August 29, 1925, in convention assembled at Indianapolis the consecrated passed a resolution known as the “Message of Hope”, and sent it forth to all peoples of good will of Christendom. Amongst other things that resolution said:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">World powers, science and philosophy, commerce and religion, have each in turn offered their respective remedies for man’s relief. In the name and under the guise of democracy, these combine in offering their joint and several powers to meet the requirements of man. Together they claim to be the sunlight of the world, holding forth all the light that shines to enlighten and guide the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Intrigue, duplicity and trickery are freely resorted to by the political and commercial powers; science and philosophy are marked by vanity and self-sufficiency; while the religionists, both Catholic and Protestant, are conspicuous by their arrogance, self-conceit, impiety and ungodliness. Therefore it is apparent that the remedies offered by any and all of these aforementioned elements are vain, impotent and powerless to satisfy man’s desire.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 130.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The twenty-five men that Ezekiel saw at the door of the temple of the Lord represent the modern clergymen and the ‘principal of their flocks’, who are the chief ones in the organization of the religion of Christendom and hence claim to be in the house of the Lord. While they claim to be the representatives of God, they are in fact the servants of Satan the Devil, and hence are constantly practicing hypocrisy before men. These self-wise “sun worshipers”, meaning those who worship intellect, science and power, greatly defame and reproach the name of Jehovah God. They are an integral part of Satan’s organization. It is the solemn duty and obligation laid upon every member of the “servant” class to tell the truth concerning such hypocrites, that by the grace of the Lord the truth might sweep away the lies and expose the hiding place thereof, that the people might know that Jehovah is the only true God and that their hope rests entirely with him. For any of the Lord’s anointed ones to slack his hand in declaring the truth concerning Satan’s organization and the visible representatives therein would be to show unfaithfulness to God and to his covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> It is a fact well known to all that since the ending of the World War a great crime wave has swept over the land called “Christendom”. Who is responsible among men for this great crime wave? The prophecy of Ezekiel lays the responsibility for the crime wave at the door of “organized Christianity” by reason of its perversion of the true worship of God and the forsaking of his Word. This was pictured in the false religious practices that Ezekiel saw going on in God’s holy temple. The clergy and the principal of the flock of Christendom claim to represent God and Christ and to rule by divine right, and yet they pursue a course of unrighteousness and have brought great reproach upon God’s name and upon the name of his Christ. They have attempted to induce the people to believe that Jehovah approves of them. The people know that they are hypocrites, because they claim to be for God and righteousness and at the same time practice unrighteousness. They claim to be advocates of the law, while they themselves break the law. By reason thereof the people have lost respect for law and order and have no regard for God and the Bible. The sanctity of human life is no longer held by the great mass of mankind, and hence “the everlasting covenant” is transgressed and frequently broken. This was shown to Ezekiel and foreshadowed the condition existing today in Christendom: “Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, 0 son of man ? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here ? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger; and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.” (8:17) “The land is full of bloody crimes, and the city [Christendom, Satan’s organization on earth] is full of violence.” (7:23) “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. ’ ’—Isa. 24: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah has laid the responsibility for this crime wave at the door of the hypocritical religionists; and any attempt on the part of the “servant” class to hold back the truth of and concerning that part of Satan’s organization would be a mark of disloyalty to God. Anyone who now professes to be in the truth and a follower of Christ Jesus, and who fails or refuses to declare the vengeance of our God against Satan and his organization, thereby gives evidence that he is not anointed by the spirit of Jehovah but, in fact, is God’s enemy. All who are anointed of the Lord are specifically authorized and commanded to declare the day of the vengeance of our God. (Isa. 61:2) Such must declare the vengeance of God against Satan’s organization; and since Satan’s visible organization is composed of false religious leaders, and the principal of their flocks, the anointed of God cannot prove faithful except by speaking the truth concerning them. It is not a question as to whether some might become offended and refuse to hear the truth. The sole question for determination by the “servant” is: ‘What has my Lord commanded, and am I obeying his commandments?’ The “servant” must declare the truth regardless of whether any one is offended and refuses to hear or whether many hear and turn to the Lord. Let the remnant or anointed “servant” class therefore keep always in mind that obedience to the commandments of God is what is required. Saul did not lose his anointing by reason of disobedience, but he was cast away from the Lord and joined the Devil’s crowd. Those who are anointed will not lose their anointing and fall back into the “tribulation” class; but, if unfaithful to that anointing, such will be cast away from Jehovah and destroyed with the Devil and his other followers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> “Organized Christianity,” under the influence of the Devil and practicing the Devil religion, is responsible for the great crime wave, particularly in America, where crime has increased most rapidly in recent years. Within a short time fifteen hundred persons have been shot to death, many of whom were entirely innocent, upon the pretext that they had in possession or were using intoxicating liquor. This practice must be a stench in the nostrils even of many supporters of ‘ ‘ organized Christianity”. The ancient Persians are said to have held an incense to the nose while worshiping the Devil or practicing Devil religion; and now likewise those who indulge in such Devil practice in the name of God and approve bloody crime and induce other crime, says the prophet, ‘ ‘ put a branch to their nose,” and this evil practice they do in the name of Jehovah and ‘have provoked God to anger’, and he declares that he will visit his anger upon them. ‘ ‘ Therefore will I also deal in fury; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.” (8:18) The breaking of the everlasting covenant by the shedding of innocent blood at the instance of the leaders in Christendom is bad enough, but the worst of all is for them to do so, claiming that God approves their action and that it is done in his name. This defamation of God’s name he declares shall not go unpunished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ That which is disclosed by the prophecy of the eighth chapter of Ezekiel seems to prepare the “.faithful servant” class for the work and obligation laid upon that class, as set forth in the ninth chapter of the prophecy.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>CREATION OF LIGHT AND ANIMALS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font4">ITHOUT the light and heat from the sun man and animals could not exist on our earth. This is by God’s own arrangement. With scientific nicety and accuracy, therefore, the Biblical record of creation sets forth that the sun by whose beams our earth is bathed with light was brought into existence before our earth. Many scientific minds have been stumbled by the thought (and by the way, it is an unscriptural one) that the six days mentioned with respect to earth’s creation were six days of twenty-four hours each. A thorough and careful examination of the Bible and comparison of the scriptures bearing on the point show that each of these creative days was really an epoch or a period of time seven thousand years long. Such a length of day allows for the gradual and regular outworking of the creative forces toward their God-assigned objective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptural account of the fourth epoch or creative day reads: “And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. ’ ’—Gen. 1:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Listeners will recall that the Bible says that it was on the first creative day that God said: “Let there be light.” This in itself shows that the sun was created before our earth (as all scientists will admit), because this light must have come from the sun. If this be true, that the light which appeared at the command of God on the first day was from the sun’s rays, how can we harmonize that thought with the statement that the sun and moon could be seen on the fourth day ? There is no proof in the Scriptures or anywhere else that the sun shone upon the earth on the fourth creative day, or that, if it were possible for a man to have been on the earth, he could then have seen the sun, moon and stars. The sun, moon and stars must have been created long prior to the time which we are now discussing; for the earth is a part of the solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the sun did not shine directly on the earth on the fourth creative day. On the contrary, the proof is quite conclusive that even on the sixth day, when Adam was on earth, the sun did not shine upon it, and that no man could see the sun prior to Noah’s time. This does not militate at all against the fact that the light emanating from the sun illuminated what the Bible calls the “great deep”, that is, the great mass of water held suspended far above and around the earth by the centrifugal force due to the rapid whirling of the earth on its axis. Neither does the same fact militate against the Bible statement that the sun appeared in the firmament on the fourth creative day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be it noted that the statement is that during the first creative day “the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. . . . And there was light”. This light was doubtless from the sun’s rays, and it lighted the great body of water or “deep” above the earth and around the earth; on the second creative day or period God created the firmament; and on the fourth creative day the light from the sun’s rays for the first time reached the firmament. The Genesis record bears this out, wherein it is recorded: “God said, Let there be lights </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the firmament of</span><span class="font4"> the heaven to divide the day from the night.” Never before is there any mention made in the Scriptures of light </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the firmament,</span><span class="font4"> and it must be taken as conclusive that the time here mentioned is the first time that light ever appeared in the firmament; and this was on the fourth creative day. The light from the sun, moon and stars, shining through the depth of waters above the firmament and upon the firmament, lighted the firmament and divided the day from the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the statement follows that God made two great lights to rule the day and the night. It does not follow that he made them at that time (that is, on the fourth day), but they were previously made by him, and now the time had come for one light to rule the day and the other to rule the night. The sun was not then visible from the earth and could not have been. The light of the sun which illuminated the firmament would cast light upon the earth through the rings of vapor and moisture yet remaining in suspension above and round about the earth, and these rings were doubtless by that time translucent; but the sun could not shine directly upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most conclusive proofs that Adam did not see the sun, and that no man saw the sun until the great flood of Noah’s day, is the fact that the rainbow appeared for the first time after Noah was delivered from the ark. This is so stated in Genesis, chapter nine, verses nine to thirteen. That was the first time that the sun’s rays lighted rainfall and produced the rainbow. In the day of Adam there was no rain, but the earth was watered by a mist rising from it. So reads the account in Genesis, chapter two, verses five and six. There could have been no rainfall as long as there was an aqueous canopy or water ring above the earth; and there could have been no deluge (which the Scriptures say did occur) without the existence of such a ring or aqueous canopy. There could have been no rainbow until after the last aqueous canopy fell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The irresistible conclusion is, therefore, that the sun’s rays began to shine in the firmament or aerial expanse on the fourth creative day. Of necessity plants and herbs greatly increased from that day, because the sun shining in the firmament would warm it and cause a condition on the earth conducive to the growth of luxuriant plants. Up to this time, as the sacred record discloses, no living creatures had appeared on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fifth creative day or period of time now opened. The aqueous ring or rings surrounding the earth and forming the watery canopy about it, now receiving the light from the sun, would produce a condition conducive to animal life upon the earth. The spirit or invisible power of the Almighty God, now operating upon the waters in harmony with his fixed law, caused these waters to bring forth abundantly moving, living creatures, such as fish and other creature life, and fowl that flew above the earth. Genesis, chapter one, verses twenty to twenty-three, reads: “And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this fifth creative period God caused to come forth great swarms of living creatures into the waters, whales, reptiles and creatures which could live out on land or in water, also shell-fish and like creatures. Geologists have discovered that there are immense beds of limestone in various parts of the earth wherein are great quantities of shells of fish, and these are called “shell-fish cemeteries”. This would support the conclusion that after the beginning of this fifth creative day there was a falling of one or more of the watery rings near the poles of our earth, and an inrushing of snow and ice which swept to the equator and destroyed great quantities of these living creatures; and afterwards the way was opened for the creation and bringing forth of other living creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the opening of the sixth creative day or period the dry land had been separated from the waters for a period of approximately twenty thousand years. The earth’s surface was cool by this time. It produced grass and herbs and fruit; and these, together with the climatic conditions, were suitable for animal life. The Scriptural account concerning this creative period, and as contained in Genesis, chapter one, verses twenty-four and twenty-five, reads; “And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beasts of the earth have not always been the same. At one time there were upon the earth great numbers of mammoth animals, some of them measuring eighty feet in length. Proof of this is now found in skeletons digged from great depths in the earth. Great numbers of these mammoths roamed the earth. Some have been found frozen in the ice and snow, while skeletons of others have been digged from the beds of earth and stone in the tropical regions. The reasonable conclusion is that each one of the ages or creative periods ended with a great catastrophe, caused by the breaking and falling at the north and south poles of one of the aqueous rings which, in turn, permitted the inrushing of great bodies of water and ice and snow which swept away the animal and plant life and rendered desolate the earth. In the course of time other animals and plants took their places on the earth. Different kinds of animals appeared at different stages of the animal creative period. During these periods a hothouse condition existed on the earth, which condition was destroyed by snow and ice; and this is proven by the physical facts. One of these physical facts was the discovery, some time ago, of the body of a mammoth, in cold storage, by Dr. Herz, in the ice-bound region of Eastern Siberia. It seems that Dr. Herz’s mammoth, like many others found buried in glacier ice, with their food undigested in their stomachs, proves that it was suddenly overtaken with a crushing fall of snow. In this case, with grass in its mouth, unmasticated, it tells an unerring tale of death in a snowy grave. If this be conceded, we have what may have been an all-competent source of glacial snows, and it seems clear that instead of our earth’s having grown cold in order to get its casement of snow, the earth got its snows and then grew cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When it is considered that each one of these creative days or periods was of seven thousand years’ duration, it can be understood how one kind of animal appeared and perished, to be succeeded by another kind and within the same creative day. In due season God created the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth, including all the domestic animals, some of which are still on the earth. Each animal had come in its due time according to the divine will, each kind had its function to perform, and all were necessarily important in the creative work of Jehovah God relative to our earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MAKE A JOY PUL NOISE </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">unto God, all ye lands: sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. Say unto God, How terrible art thou</span><span class="font3"> tn </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHAT IS MAN?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font4">DAM was created in the image and likeness of Jehovah and was created perfect. After his sin and expulsion from Eden he begot children. These children were begotten in the likeness of Adam, the pauper or imperfect man. They were not begotten in the likeness of God. The seed of evil was in them. That condition has existed at all times and all children have been born evil. Aside from Jesus there has never been a child born that has been free from bodily weakness or from the taint of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although there is nothing to indicate that Adam had a hope of being permitted to return to Eden, the record indicates that he would have done so had he not been prevented. God placed at the oast of Eden, which was evidently the only entrance, cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to prevent Adam from returning and partaking of the tree of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the reasons why Adam could not return to Eden were: (1) the divine judgment entered against him, which was final, and from which there was no appeal and which was enforced by his expulsion; (2) the ingratitude of his heart toward God and the lack of regret for his wrongful act; and (3) his desire for things sinful, which was greater than his desire for things that were right. Even if it had been possible to remove the judgment, the ingratitude and desire for sin would still stand in the way. This is strong proof that the way of reconciliation to God when opened can be successfully pursued only by those who have a desire for righteousness and who have gratitude and love for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what was to be the ultimate end of man? He was outside of Eden with the sentence of death against him being gradually enforced. Before their being completely executed the purpose of God was to permit Adam and Eve to bring forth children. What would be the effect upon this offspring ? and what would be the final destiny of these children. Would their offspring go on the downward road until all would be completely exterminated? What effect would sin have upon the angels of heaven?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sin on the earth must have an effect upon the living creatures of God’s realm beyond the confines of the earth. Again the clergy, by false reasoning and by the influence of the enemy Satan, have arrived at the wrong conclusion and mistaught the people on this point. For many years they have taught that the life of man is not extinct at death, but that man continues to live on, and that all those who will not reform will be shut up in a separate place of terrible misery, and there be tormented by living creatures in other parts of Jehovah’s realm, and this to continue with no hope of ever being relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is manifest from the judgment of Jehovah that the ultimate end of the human race must be destruction unless God, in the exercise of his loving-kindness, should intervene in man’s behalf. It is manifest that if reconciliation is ever to be effected between God and mankind the initiative must be taken by Jehovah and he must make it possible for man to return to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Would God do something in behalf of the pauper race? God has not left us in darkness on this point Now after sixty centuries he is making it so clear concerning his purposes that all men can understand that he has provided a gracious way of returning man to himself. It is true that for nineteen hundred years now those who have consecrated themselves to do the will of God, and have faithfully performed that covenant so to do, trusting in the merit of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, have understood in a manner God’s way of reconciliation. The mass of mankind, however, have gone on in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God had his arrangement for reconciliation from the beginning and knew all the minutiae of its execution, because it is written: “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.’’ (Acts 15:18) But only those who have been devoted to Jehovah have had an understanding of his gracious provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The good message of reconciliation has been preached by a few through the centuries past, but this good news has been hid from the mass of mankind. Concerning this it is written: “If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. ’ ’—2 Cor. 4:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A knowledge of God’s gracious provision for reconciliation must be had by man before man can comply with the terms thereof. It has been and is the policy of Satan the enemy to keep men blinded concerning God’s gracious provision. To this end Satan has employed the ambitious clergy to teach false doctrines and to give man the wrong conception of himself and of his origin and his destiny. Among other things they have taught that man is not wholly a human creature but is part human and part divine. This is one of the stumblingstones that must be removed, and it is now being removed that the people may see how God can be just and the justifier of mankind and how he can consistently reconcile mankind to himself and restore to himself all who are obedient to his righteous laws. By and through his Word alone can it be determined what man is and what man’s relationship is to his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So let us examine the question, What is man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is conceded that the mind is a part of the creature man; that by the exercise of the mind man searches out facts, weighs them, and reaches a conclusion upon the question under consideration. Man reasons from effect to cause in his endeavor to ascertain why certain things are so. Many times a man has propounded the question, What is man? Many have earnestly and diligently examined the evidence submitted upon the question. Men of sound mind require the production of the best evidence obtainable in their endeavor to arrive at a just conclusion upon an important question at issue. The highest type of evidence, and that which proceeds from a trustworthy source, is demanded upon the question at issue, What is man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man advances a theory that the moon is made of green cheese. He appears before an intelligent audience and asks that audience to listen to his evidence and argument in support of his theory. The intelligent men and women of the audience look at each other with a smile and say: ‘That poor man is probably earnest and sincere in his belief that the moon is made of green cheese, but it is apparent to every reasonable person and from the evidence within the reach of all that the moon is not made of green cheese. We will therefore not make ourselves foolish by listening to this man. He is a fool, but why should we permit him to make fools of us?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another man appears before an intelligent audience. He has the reputation of being a wise man. He looks wise and is wise in his own conceits and speaks with profound gravity. He is a theological professor, a clergyman of renown, and is called a scientist and savant. He requests that audience to hear him present his argument in support of a new theory concerning the origin of man. He briefly outlines his theory as follows: ‘That man is a product of the force of evolution; that millions of years ago particles or atoms formed themselves into protoplasm; that by the operation of the forces of nature life began to manifest itself in the lowest form; that after millions of years more this evolution process developed a monkey; that the process continued until there resulted an animal which we call man. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He then offers to produce the proof and argument in support of his evolution theory. The intelligent audience hears him state briefly his theory and then says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘That man probably is sincere in his belief, and by his method of reasoning he may be able to convince himself that man is the product of evolution; but he could not possibly have any competent evidence in support of his astounding theory. If he so desires he may believe that his ancestors were monkeys, but we will not stultify ourselves nor dignify his foolishness by listening to him. We believe the Bible, and his theory is diametrically opposed to the Bible. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why should anyone who believes God and believes that the Bible is his Word of Truth waste time listening to or entering into a discussion of a theory of evolution of man? To enter into a discussion as to whether or not the moon made itself from green cheese or is green cheese is foolishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To engage in an argument as to whether man was created by Jehovah or made himself by evolution or evolved from protoplasm is worse than foolishness. It is an insult to Jehovah God. Would any Christian stultify himself by entering into a discussion as to whether or not every good and perfect thing proceeded from Satan the Devil or from Jehovah God? No one can.be a Christian unless he believes that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is God’s beloved Son, the Savior of mankind. The very life of a Christian is faith in God and his Word, the Bible. Why then should a Christian enter into an argument of a proposition the very statement of which makes God a liar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Word of God is plain as to the origin of man. It is in no wise ambiguous. The Word of God is the end of all controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This speaker believes that Jehovah is the only true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and believes that his Word is the truth; he believes that Jesus Christ is God’s great Executive Officer in the creation of all things, and that he is the Redeemer of man; he therefore refuses to consider so-called evidence that is offered in support of the theory that man is a creature of evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theory of evolution of man proceeds from the Devil, regardless of who holds or advocates that theory. The Devil is that wicked one who betrayed the sacred trust committed to him, rebelled against his Maker, seduced the angels of heaven and brought degradation upon the human race. To seriously enter into a discussion of the question as to whether God made the first man or whether man is the result of the process of evolution would be giving countenance to the Devil and would therefore be displeasing to Jehovah God. Some who are consecrated to the Lord have thought it wise to join issue with the advocates of evolution and seriously discuss the origin of man. They have thought it well to enter into the evidence relating to the lower animals and compare this with other evidence offered by evolutionists and then discuss seriously which is correct, the so-called scientific evidence or the Bible. In this they have erred, according to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">O JEHOVAH, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall he destroyed for ever. But thou, Jehovah, art most high for evermore.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>JEWS</span><span class="font7"> AND THE HOLY LAND</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HE Israelites, also called Jews, have a great affection for the land of Palestine. For many centuries it was the land of their fathers. Their desire is to have the land fully restored to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Are the Jews the rightful owners and justly entitled to the full and uninterrupted possession of the land of Palestine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Will the Jews be restored to the possession of the land of Palestine, build there their permanent home, and then dwell in peace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the evidence now available furnishes proof satisfactorily answering these questions in the affirmative, such answer should bring comfort to the heart of every real Jew. Not only that, but proof of this should stimulate Jews to greater zeal and activity in possessing and rebuilding Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only Jews, but Gentiles, should have a keen interest in the question of the rebuilding of Palestine; because, if the time has come for this to be done, it means the great transformation period in the affairs of the world. Candid and unbiased consideration of the evidence now to be presented is invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The land of Palestine is that portion of the earth’s surface known as the Holy Land. It is called the Holy Land because it is the land chosen by Jehovah God as the theater of the most momentous events in the history of man. When Jehovah, through Moses, gave the law to Israel he said therein concerning the land: &quot;The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine.” (Lev. 25:23) That which is specially set aside by Jehovah for his purposes is holy; hence it is properly called the Holy Land.—Zech. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canaan is the name originally given to that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the land which God promised to give to Abraham. Dr. Isaac Leeser, in his translation of the Pentateuch, makes first mention of the land of Palestine, using that word in Exodus 15:14. This reference is to that portion of the land then inhabited by the Philistines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In several places in the Holy Scriptures the word Palestine is used in reference to this land, but in each instance it is from the Hebrew word properly rendered Philistia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Originally, the land of Philistia meant that long strip of land lying along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Through this strip of land was the road or highway between Egypt and Phoenicia and other northern countries. The name Palestine was gradually extended to the country farther inland until it became the name applied to all the land of the Jews, both west and east of the River Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By common usage, the word Palestine is now applied to all that portion of the earth's surface known as the Holy Land. During the period of the reigns of David and Solomon, Palestine, or the Holy Land, embraced all that land bounded by the river of Egypt and the wilderness on the south, Lebanon and the great River Euphrates on the north and east, and the Mediterranean Sea on the west. It embraces an area of upward of 100,000 square miles. Before the desolation this land must have been very rich and productive, because it furnished support and maintenance for millions of people. That land, though made desolate, is capable of being brought again to so high a state of productivity that it can support many millions of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the Jews who lay claim to the land of Palestine and who desire to rebuild their homes there. The question then arises, Who is a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jacob was a grandson of Abraham, the latter known as the “father of the faithful”. Jacob became the possessor of the birthright which descended from Abraham, according to the promise which God made unto Abraham. On a certain occasion the Lord caused the name of Jacob to be changed to that of Israel. (Gen. 32:28) When Jacob (then Israel) was old and about to die, he called before him his sons that he might prophesy and tell them what should take place in the future. At this time began the nation of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Genesis 49:28 it is written, “All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.” The entire 49th chapter of Genesis is worthy of careful reading in this connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judah was the name of one of the sons of Jacob, and he became the head of the tribe of Judah. All the descendants of Jacob (now Israel) were from that time forward properly called Israelites; but not all the descendants of Israel can be properly called Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the religious hopes of the descendants of Israel (Jacob), from the time of his death, rested in the tribe of Judah, because of the specific prophecy uttered by Jacob on his deathbed concerning the tribe of Judah. This prophecy is recorded in Genesis 49, verses 8 to 10:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is the clear and positive statement that the one to whom the people shall be gathered, and the one who shall be their lawgiver, must be a descendant of the tribe of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jacob was a holy man of God, because he believed God and obeyed him. It was the power of God that moved Jacob to speak the words of this prophecy; therefore the words must be taken as the words of Jehovah God. No one can please God unless he believes in the existence of Jehovah, and that he, Jehovah God, is the true and only God and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore a Jew is one who is the natural descendant of Jacob (Israel), and who has faith in the words uttered by Jacob concerning Judah. Such a one will have faith in all the promises that God has made to the Israelites through his prophets, who were holy men of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One may be a natural descendant of Israel, and even of the tribe of Judah, and yet not be a Jew. If he repudiates the promise God made concerning the gathering of the people unto the descendant of Judah, he is as one who has renounced his allegiance to his native land and ceased to be a citizen thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a citizen of England emigrates to the United States, renounces his allegiance to the king of England, and becomes a citizen of the Unites States, he is no longer an Englishman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the same reason, if a descendant of Jacob, and even a direct descendant of Judah, renounces faith in the promises of God, he thereby ceases to be a Jew. There are many natural descendants of Israel who have no faith in God and no faith in his Word. Such are not Jews within the meaning of the scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a clergy class among the Israelites, even as there is such a class among the Gentiles. Few, if any, of those of the clergy class have real faith in the Word of God, because they have become wise in their own conceits, feeding themselves and not feeding the people, and have repudiated the Word of the Lord, even as the Prophet Ezekiel foretold that they would do. Read this interesting prophecy, if you will, in the 34th chapter of Ezekiel, verses 1 to 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a class of natural descendants from Israel, or Jacob, who believe that Jehovah is the only true and living God, and that Moses and others of the holy prophets wrote the Holy Scriptures under the direction of the Almighty God. These are properly called orthodox Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is a statement of their faith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I believe with a true and perfect faith (1) that God is the creator, governor and maker of all creatures, and that he hath wrought all things; (2) that the Creator is one, and that he alone hath been our God, is, and for ever shall be; (3) that the Creator is not corporeal, not to be comprehended with any bodily properties, and that there is no bodily essence tliat can be likened unto him; (4) that nothing was before him, and that he shall abide for ever; (5) that he is to be worshiped, and none else; (6) that all the words of the prophets are true; (7) that the prophecies of Moses are true; that he was chief of all wise men that lived before him or ever shall live after him; (8) that all the law which at this day is found in our hands was delivered by our God himself to our master, Moses; (9) that the same law is never to be changed, nor any other to be given us by God; (10) that God understandeth all the thoughts and works of men, as it is written in the prophets: “Ho fashioneth their hearts alike, he understandeth all their works”; (11) that God will recompense good to them that keep his commandments, and will punish them who transgress them; (12) that the Messiah is yet to come; and, although he retard his coming, yet ‘ ‘ I will wait for him till he come ’ ’; (13) that the dead shall be restored to life when it shall seem fit unto God, the Creator, whose name be blessed and memory celebrated without end. Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That class of natural descendants of Jacob who have such faith in God and in his Word, as set forth in tho quotation just given, really are Jews. Such will receive comfort by now giving careful consideration to the prophecies of God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH SENDING PROSPERITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford and Colaborers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We wish to express our thanks and appreciation to Jehovah God for the light he is sending us at this time. We wish to state we are in harmony with all the work the Society wishes done at this time. We wish to extend to you, Brother Rutherford, our thanks and prayers on your behalf for your labor of love for us. Surely the Lord has opened the windows of heaven and is pouring out his blessings; and how rejoicing it is to carry out the Lord’s work in his appointed way! It energizes one to want to put full time in his service, a service that will bring the only joy, peace, and happiness in these distressing times we are passing through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We surely can lift up our heads and rejoice; and how the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> articles are giving us the necessary encouragement, that we shall be able to stand the fiery darts of the wicked one! These articles are so plain that we could not conscientiously have an excuse for failing to make our calling and election sure. The light is shining so brightly and being made so plain that we fail to find an excuse for not doing our share in proclaiming this wonderful message of the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear beloved Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Love and greetings in the name of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been very busy for some weeks carefully studying the two books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> and recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers.</span></p>

Fitting the “facts to the prophecy’’ in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> is a positive joy. “John to the seven churches ’ ’ is such a vivid rehearsal of my own thirty-five years of class experience that it was positively painful on first reading. It was all so real that it took me some little time to recover from the mental anguish. Lately, as I have glanced back over that long-drawn-out experience since I first came into the truth I have wondeied how it was possible that I did stand up through it all. Now I see. It was by the “comfort’’ and the “guidance’’ of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every page of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> bears evidence that “His angel’’ guided the hand that wrote it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It appears that God has taken the fingerprints of the “man of sin” and there will be no mistake of his identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These people that have the “one man” idea so deeply set in their minds may yet be glad to give up the notion. You remember, back “in the good old days when we were developing character”, the pilgrims would tell us that we were like phonograph records in the making. And now, if they insist, the playing of records should be quite convincing. How happy we are that the Lord Jesus is directing our part in the work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in the joy of the Lord,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LISTENING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just a few lines to let you know that we love you and all that are coworkers with you. Your untiring efforts to encourage have been a great encouragement to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We find that your radio lectures are surely battering down the walls. We called upon those whose names were sent to us, and left with them the books. One of these had been listening to your lectures for more than a year; and he is a graduate of many schools and arts, and had heard and read the greatest authors of the world, but none would compare with the lectures that came to him from the Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He told us of one of his experiences with a lawyer on whom he was calling. He said this lawyer could quote more Bible than any other man he had ever met, and that when he got through quoting it he said he did not believe one word of it. “Well,” he said, “I want to ask if you ever heard Judge Rutherford lecture over the radio.” The lawyer said, “No.” “Well, there is one man I want you to hear.” Then he told him when to tune in; and the lawyer said he would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In two weeks this man said he was back to see the lawyer, and said, “Did you do what I told you!” The lawyer said, “Yes; I have heard him twice, and I want to thank you for telling me to tune in, for he sure knows what he is talking about. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophecy is being fulfilled, ‘He that heareth may come also and drink of the water of life.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dear brother, we are happy to be with you in this great fight for the kingdom by the Lord’s grace; and may the great Jehovah continue to use and to bless you for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren in the service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lehman Party of Colporteurs, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICING, PRAYING, ACTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in the name of our dear Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is with the spirit of joy and thanksgiving to the Lord that we express our appreciation of the “meat in due season” that is being served so richly from the Lord’s table through the columns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> and other publications of the Society. The books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> have been a great source of strength and encouragement, pointing out in a most remarkable way the fulfilment of the Revelation in the events of our day, and verifying that the end of Sa’tan’s wicked reign is at hand. How glad we are to have a part in the witnessing work as members of the Lord’s army, pressing the battle to the gate, to the honor of Jehovah God our great King and Christ Jesus the Captain of our salvation, our Leader and Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems specially appropriate that we assure you of our loyalty and whole-hearted support as director of the Lord’s army this side the vail in this great battle being waged against Satan and his wicked organization. No doubt Satan’s greatest efforts are being put forth to destroy the remnant who are upholding the Lord’s standard, and particularly the ones who are at the forefront of the fight as representatives of Jehovah. But the Lord will not permit him to do so, we are assured, so long as there is service to render to his glory. We are rejoicing in having a part in this work in cooperation with the Society, and are resolved to redouble our prayers for the Lord’s blessing and protection upon you in your efforts to serve and please him, and to quicken our zeal as witnesses for the kingdom. Surely it is no time for idling on the part of the Lord’s children, but for intense activity as servants of Jehovah, and victory is at hand through the power and blessing of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are looking forward with joy to the Columbus and auxiliary conventions as additional opportunities of glorifying the name of Jehovah and advancing the interests of the kingdom. We are glad that Washington has been chosen for one of these conventions, and shall put forth every effort to make it a success, by the grace of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kindly convey our Christian love and greetings to the family of the Lord who are with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in the service of our Rang,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Washington</span><span class="font3"> (D. C.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ecclesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LIVING WATERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The timely articles in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> are indeed great in the unfolding of present truth at this time. Those on the “Holy Spirit” and “The Man of Sin” are indeed an inspiration to me. Human words cannot express my thoughts and appreciation at the outpouring of the ‘living waters’. Wherefore, dear brother, I pray always for you that our heavenly Father will continue to count you worthy of this calling and to fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power, justice, wisdom and love, that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and that you may be able, by the Lord’s favor, to bring forth from the Lord’s storehouse meat in due season to the saints, that the Wicked may be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother by the Lord’s grace,</span></p>

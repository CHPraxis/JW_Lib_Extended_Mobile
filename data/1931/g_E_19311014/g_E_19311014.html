Well, it certainly needs help; there are whole communities, like Taylor, where the mines have been closed because unprofitable and the people are without work and starving; others worked last year but 56 days during the entire year, or but little more than one day per ■week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Here is a district, formerly with plenty of rain, in which no rain has fallen for seven years. Here is a story that four thousand Madrid children are sleeping in the former royal sausage factory, using royal bed linen with crests. Here is another story, that Cardinal Segura tried to smuggle in circular letters addressed to all the Spanish bishops, advising them to sell all possible church properties before they could be seized by the government. With that the Madrid government sent an ultimatum to the Vatican demanding the removal of Se-g’ura and giving the pope only five days’ time in which to make up his mind what to do. Many of the clergy of Spain have discarded clerical dress for citizen attire, because of fear of the people. Lands held by the nobility as a result of loans made by them or their ancestors to the king must be restored to the state. Troops have been moved into the clerical strongholds to prevent a clerical revolt. A decree has been issued preventing the sale or transfer or mortgaging of any ecclesiastical property. This ties up millions of dollars of property held in the name of banks and private individuals for the 38,000 nuns and 10,000 monks who have such great financial interests in Spain. Things are certainly moving in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kingdom Work in Fiji </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By A. L. McGregor 'and A. Aucliterlonie, Colporteurs</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font7">HE beauty and manifold charms and attractions of the islands of the South Pacific have been recorded by many writers. They have written in a romantic and thrilling way that has caused many people to long to visit these ‘Isles of Enchantment’. Many of these writings have been greatly exaggerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the Blue Book of Fiji, Year 1929, the estimated population of Fiji is as follows: Europeans 4,702, Half-castes 3,244, Fijians 91,711, Indians 73,121, and Chinese 1,464. The two main missions in Fiji are the Methodist Missionary Society of Australasia and the Roman Catholic Mission, both under the control of Satan the Devil. Satan, through the Methodist mission, controls 78,000 Fijians; and through the Roman Catholic Mission, 12,979 Half-castes and Fijians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two days after our arrival we started our campaign, in IBSA Week 25th Sept.-5th Oct., in the capital town, Suva. It resulted in the placing of 210 books and booklets. We started by placing a good number of a two-page paper of “Freedom for the People” in the Chinese language with the Chinamen, who are mainly in stores and shops. They expressed surprise at two white men visiting their quarters placing papers in their own language. They are a quiet, hard-working race, and as very few can speak English it is hard to know just what they thought of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The European population in Suva we found to be, in the majority, a selfish, snobbish class of people, a great many being rationalists or evolutionists. In Australia one would term them as the ‘middle class’, but on coming here, and being placed mainly in positions of authority, whether in stores or other places, and being able to ‘lord’ it over a few of their fellow men (yes, fellow men though they be black in color) they become heady and selfish. However, even amongst the Europeans we placed many books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian population in Suva is large. We could only bring the message to the many Indians, who have been educated in the English language. Amongst these we met, in the majority, a civil and generous class of people. These Indians, particularly the young Indians, have a great interest in the world’s affairs. They are ever desirous of increasing their knowledge, and we found great interest paid to the Kingdom message. We placed a big number of JFR sets with them. We have been stopped many times on the streets by Indians desirous of obtaining the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Fijian population here in Suva is also a large one, and some day soon we hope to bring them the Kingdom message in their own language. We found a few who could read English well, and who readily took the books. On the whole the Fijians are a ‘happy-go-lucky’ race, but since they have become ‘civilized’ many in Suva and in Lautoka, two of the main towns, are becoming selfish in many ways. The grand total of books and booklets placed in Suva in three weeks was 700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fiji consists of about 250 islands. Eighty of these are inhabited. Suva is on the main island, named Viti Levu. On finishing off Suva we purposed going round .this island. We traveled by a cutter from Suva to Ligatoka. Ligatoka is a beautiful district situated on either side of the Ligatoka river. Here we met with a great welcome. In two days we placed 200 books and booklets. The Fijians were very surprised to find two white men living in a little tent six feet by eight feet. We have roughed it in our little tent, and with the terrific heat, rains and mosquitoes we have had a grand time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Ligatoka we met a fine class of Europeans; more homely and natural, and we placed sets of JFR and 10 booklets with nearly all of them. We had to finish the district in two days in order to catch the passenger train to our next stop. This passenger train is run by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, wdiich company owns a large portion of this island. This train is something like an IBSA meeting: seats free, and no collection. It is said that this is the only free passenger train in the world. Although the journey is slow, and the seats hard, still one gets there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our next stop was Lautoka. Lautoka is the headquarters of the C.S.R.Co., whose sugar mill is one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Here we found the Europeans divided into three classes. This division is no doubt caused by individuals who feel more important than their’ fellow men. The first division consists of the officers, who are a snobbish lot of individuals and who, in the main, had no time for the Kingdom message. The second class are engineers. They are a more civil class, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">amongst them we placed many books and booklets. The third class are the mechanics. Here we found some </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">men.</span><span class="font7"> Although rough, many of them are honest, and a goodly number of books, were placed. The Indians we found to be very kind, generous, civil, and with a keen interest in the Kingdom message. We placed many books and booklets; also a number of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions were received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here in Lautoka we experienced a hurricane. It lasted about seven hours. It feels queer inside a little six by eight tent when one never knows if the tent and all the ‘gear’ will get blown into the South Pacific. The tent blew down. However, we were near a pavilion and v/e stacked all our ‘gear’ there and waited patiently for the dawning of another day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On finishing Lautoka we packed up and took the free train to the Ba district. On arriving there we found that nearly all of the land was owned by the C.S.R.Co., so that we had to get permission from the manager to camp on the grounds. One of us met him and, after explaining in detail our message, asked for permission to camp. This individual asked what we believed responsible for the oppression of the people, and he was told ‘big politicians, big financiers and big religious leaders under the control of Satan’, and he turned round and with an angry tongue roared to ‘go to blazes, to get out of here’. Mind you, it was only six feet by eight feet we wanted. He was thanked for his kindness. We went to some Fijians, and in the end received some school ground to camp on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here in Ba we met with the same class as in Lautoka, always receiving kindness and consideration from the Indians. The Indians hide may be of a different color from ours, and it was neither of our faults that we w<sup>T</sup>ere born different in color, but we have met them with white and honest hearts. While one of us stopped in Ba one went to Penang. Here he received the hospitality of an Indian whom he had met in Lautoka. He was given a bed to sleep in and food to eat and received kindness and consideration. The Lord will favor him. This gentleman took a set of JFR and ten booklets and is now a subscriber for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> and shewed interest in the work. In one day quite a number of books were placed: 5 JFR sets, 60 booklets and 5 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On returning to Ba we both packed up and, boarding a little boat called the “Adi Cakan”, we set sail for Suva. In all we placed in seven actual working weeks 2,000 books and booklets, including a number of new subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> On our journey around we had many amusing experiences, but they are too numerous to mention. We realize our great privilege in bringing the Kingdom message to the poor groaning, oppressed people of the isles. The words of Jehovah the Almighty through Isaiah the prophet give us encouragement and joy when we realize that His will is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, Ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom Message in Central Africa </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Gray Smith</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS with great joy that my brother and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I heard the grand news that Judge Rutherford had placed most of Africa under care of the Cape Town office, and being allotted the privilege of pioneering in East and Central Africa we speedily had a motor caravan for two fitted up, on a De Soto chassis with two bunks, electric light, petrol stove, cooking pots, roll-up-side canvas, wire netting, etc., knives, shovel, tools, etc., and on the 27th April sailed on the good ship Llanstephan to Mombasa, a sea distance of 3,000 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We duly arrived at Mombasa, which is a mixture of Arabic, Portuguese and Anglo-Saxons, and a town where for centuries thousands of miserable slaves from the interior were exported like cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our caravan was slung ashore from the steamer, and the great adventure began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had to beat the heavy rains, so started on our 400-mile rush to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya (3,600 white population).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After leaving Mombasa and passing countless thousands of cocoanut palms our nightmare trip of four days began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For four days we struggled on through forests and mountains, over tracks and through swamps, often going only four miles per hour, with one of us constantly walking ahead with shovel and knife, filling in holes, cutting tracks, etc., and often passing wild game. Our meals all the journey were fruit and vegetables only. Vve slept in the bush each night and kept going all day and a lot of the night with the one desire to get the message moving in this great virgin land. We traveled over 100 miles without seeing a white man or European house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At last we got to Nairobi, and within 48 hours got busy, and our hearts almost stopped when we looked at our pile of 200 sets of volumes and 600 booklets and saw the small population. However, we had come for a purpose, and set down to work in real hard earnest. We worked all day, Sunday and Saturday included, and vcent through the town like a sieve. Every man “out” we marked him down and went back again and again till we got him. We used each man to recommend us to people he knew, and chased them up, using his name, and also asked the name of each man next door, so as to be able to ask for them by name. The astounding result was such a blessing from the Lord that we must have broken the world’s record, as our average distribution between the two of us was six to ten full sets of nine volumes per day, plus 600 booklets placed the first eight days as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each night we sad writing envelopes and posting price-lists to all the hunters, farmers and country people all over the land we could not get at otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were ordered out of offices, insulted, called liars, and threatened with the police, but on we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The population is very mixed, consisting (other than British) of Indians, Coolies, Par-sees, Sikhs, Arabs, Somalis, Kikuyu and many others, including French Seychelles Islands natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The distances are great, hundreds of miles between villages, often over rough tracks, flimsy bridges, through lion and elephant country, and the rough tracks impassable after rain; but who cares when on the Master’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The message has never been in this vast country before, and already the people are taking sides and the clergy uttering warnings; but the clergy are too late: the “damage” is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to different altitudes one is in 100 degrees one week and shivering the next, and the sun is shining one moment and it is raining the next, in the rainy season. The climate, on the whole, is fine. The products of this land are coffee, tea, maize, dairy products and sisal (the last is a plant, the leaves of which are shredded and made into a fine rope overseas). All work is done by natives, Swahilis and Somalis, and as they are not taught English they will not be able to get the message unless in their native language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people most interested in our work is a class of 'Christian’ Indians from the Bombay district of India known as the Goans, and we placed hundreds of books with them, although, strange to say, thej^ are nearly all Boman Catholics. We placed a number with educated Hindoo and Mohammedan doctors and leading business men. Practically every leading business European man in Nairobi received a set, and this town has been soaked with the message; through and through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We do not know what the rest of the territory will be like, but the message should easily spread from Nairobi right through the country till Africa is linked from north to south and east to west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are about to go through the wildest, grandest and most wonderful part of Central Africa, the great wild game country wdiere roam countless elephants, lion, zebra, buck, etc., but without even a revolver we feel perfectly safe in the hands of our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again w<sup>T</sup>e thank our heavenly Father for the wonderful opportunity of taking the message through this great dark continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[There comes a day when every hero must lay down his arms. No matter how stout the heart, the flesh will some time give way.

<p><span class="font7">TN ITS issue of July 22 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font7"> has an A interesting article entitled “International Bankruptcy in Sight”. Speaking of the strenuous and successful efforts at Basel, Berlin, London and New York, to keep Germany from going to the wall and dragging all the rest of the world along with it, and of the foolish attitude of the French Government, seeking to dicker politically to the last minute, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation </span><span class="font7">says: “It is the gravest financial emergency that the modern world has ever faced, and it is surpassed in its menace to all nations only by the outbreak of the World War on August 1, 1914.” Since this was written Great Britain has fallen into the same trough in which Germany is v,'allowing, but in the latter instance all that was necessary was to overthrow the Labor government, which is what the big financiers have long been planning to bring about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Utilities Companies Fighting the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">U</span><span class="font7">SING the courts as an instrument the public utilities companies are putting up a fight against the people of Logansport, Indiana, because the good people of that city own and profitably operate their own electric light plant. Every possible effort is being made by lawyers to so entangle and harass the mayor by court rulings that he will not know which way to turn, but so far the mayor is too sharp for them. Vvhen the public service commission of the state (which is apparently working hand in glove with the Power Trust and against the people, as it does everywhere) ordered a reduction in the Logansport rates, the mayor refused to reduce the rates as ordered, but brought suit in the name of the city, claiming the city’s right to manage its own property ■without interference by the commission, and then lowered the rates far more than the board had ordered. The case is still in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Sheep and a Goal at Markdale </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Elsie Carson (Ontario)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font7">E ARRIVED in the little town of Markdale, and after a weary search found rooms in a comfortable home with the dearest little lady eighty years young and living alone. “Of course I’ll take you,” she said promptly when I had explained our work, “I have enjoyed having some of your workers at my home before.” There was such a kindly air of hospitality that we felt at home and realized that our heavenly Father had again provided for our every need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two days later, being Sunday and our best day for witnessing, we started early and spent a happy day in the Lord’s service. On Monday morning, after we had gone to work a “reverend” gentleman from two doors away called on our little landlady and with hands upraised in holy horror asked her if she knew<sup>7</sup> that w<sup>T</sup>e were out “selling books on Sunday”! “And what of it!” she replied, “I presume you took up a collection yesterday?” “Ah,” he said, “a very different matter. Why do you keep them, anyway?” “Because I like them,” she replied. “No,” he said, “it is for the money.” “Well,” she answered, “I wouldn’t keep any of your people (“Gospel workers”) again for $5.00 a day each, after the experience I had with them!” Also, she told him she had learned more about the Bible from reading those books than in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man who came to cut the grass, and others, reported about the Sunday‘book-selling’; but, nothing daunted, Mrs. F. had an answer for them all. Her loyalty w<sup>7</sup>as fully tested, however, when, a few evenings later, we were waited upon by an officer of the lav<sup>7</sup> sent from the crown attorney’s office to inquire why v,<sup>7</sup>e were thus “breaking the Sabbath”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He requested that I go with him to Mr. Henry’s office, which I gladly did, the officer carrying my case of books. Both men agreed that they had no personal feeling in the matter; but a great many complaints had come in, and, in answer to my question, they admitted that it was from the clergy. They seemed surprised at the price of the hooks and that there was no salary attached to the work. Not knowing what else to do, the crown attorney said he would have to write to Ottawa because he felt sure we were breaking the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were somewhat uneasy lest our kind little landlady might be embarrassed at our encounter with the police; but not so. Next day she waited on the crown attorney herself and indignantly informed him that if the people of Markdale would attend to some of the things that needed attention and never mind those Christian people that were staying with her it would suit them better. As she was one of his best clients he smilingly agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another attempt to hinder our work was the enclosed advertisement in the weekly newspaper, intended to frighten people into not taking the books. It not having come out openly, we can only guess as to its origin, which without doubt was clerical. An amusing thing about the advertisement was that it was so clumsily written that one woman thought it was an advertisement for our 10c books, and we found only one woman who really understood the notice. A good many books were placed in this town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preacher, who, after repeated attempts, failed to convince our landlady that we were doing wrong refused to oblige her any longer by bringing her mail from the post office, even though he had accepted many favors from her. He did not return her key like a man, but enclosed it in an envelope and left it in the post office. [It was a downright crime against humanity to wean this thing and to dress it, part of the time, in pants.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A week later our kind hostess bade us goodbye, with tears in her eyes, and we also felt as though we were leaving home and mother. We look forward to the time when the Lord will say to her, ‘Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Racketeering of Missions and Evangelists</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font7">N AN article bearing this title in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Real</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Detective</span><span class="font7"> for September, Mike Owsley Letcher, self-reformed pickpocket and drug fiend, says, “Ninety percent of the missions are operated by racketeers. The heads of missions are mostly old thieves or reformed booze fighters who have lost their intestinal fortitude, like Billy Sunday. They are too cowardly to steal and too lazy to work. So they switch to a softer racket. They stagger around the country, in and out of churches, telling good people that Jesus saved them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Billy Sunday staggered into the Pacific Garden Mission one night and was saved. Billy hadn’t been around the place long until his smart mind took in the possibilities of the racket. He quit drinking and got in on the big time. No doubt he has been the most successful of the lot, for he is a millionaire today. Sunday had a keener mind than the average broken-down drunkard or crook who is saved. And he cashed in on it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mike tells us that he was often engaged by mission heads to say that he was saved in this or that mission, so as to help the mission extract support from the merchants and others. He gives names and addresses of mission heads who are making $300 a month shipping and selling out of town clothing which is given to them to distribute to the poor. He says further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> have stood in pulpits of twenty-three churches in the middle West and told religious people how I was saved. And in each church I told a different story. I quit the racket for the simple reason that after I had stood up before the good people in the pews of those churches, people who were willing to believe me and help me, and told them a string of falsehoods which they took for the truth, I couldn’t go home and sleep at night. I was ashamed of myself, and I felt lower than I had ever felt in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ninety percent of the gospel missions of the country are only burdens to the community in which they operate. They take money and merchandise out of a community and return no good. They only attract a lot of crooks and bums to prey on the good will of tire citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Liberty or Obedience——Which ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font7">UE issue of July 8 contains an article entitled “Bible Students Radio Echo”, which please see. It aims to give Scriptural proof of the fact that God has His ways of doing things and that it does not follow that those that were once used by Him will continue to be so used. Several illustrations were selected to prove the point, Esau, Nadab and Abihu, Miriam, the unfaithful spies, Korah, Dathan and Abiram, King Saul and Uzzah. In conclusion we said: As respects the dialogues of “Frank and Ernest”, it is a matter of record that these dialogues were broadcast for several years from Radio Station WBBR, the Watchtower; and it is as apparent that during those years “Frank and Ernest” were greatly used and highly honored by the Lord as it is that Nadab and Abihu, Miriam, the ten spies, Korah, Dathan and Abi rani and their comrades, and Saul and Uzzah were used before their deflections arose. But those who are wise toward God will now have nothing to do with “Frank and Ernest” or with the “Bible Students Radio Echo”, now that these men have ceased their association with the instrumentality God is using in the earth to perform His work at this time, and this regardless of what they broadcast, whether it be good, bad or indifferent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have now before us an eleven-page singlespaced typewritten reply in the form of an open letter to the editor. It occupies the major portion of “Witness Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 1, September, 1931”, and is cleverly written by a capable man. It concludes with information as to where contributions may be sent, and it will be strange if it does not mislead many. Its major appeal is that of liberty, as will he apparent from the following clauses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Christian is called unto liberty.” P. 1, If T-“That precious heritage of Christian liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">P. 1,fl2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“'The same spirit of Christian liberty.” P. 5, fl 6. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Your recent article against Christian liberty.” P. 6, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'To lose the spirit of Christian liberty.” P. 7, fl 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To reassert your Christian liberty.” P. 9, fl 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'And grants full Christian liberty.” P. 9, fl 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You will rejoice to cooperate with your free brethren.” P. 11, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'Then, and not until then, will you be free in Christ.” P. 11, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Be it known to all that there is no liberty so complete as that of the bond slave of Jesus Christ. He submits to his Master’s will, not because he must, but because he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wishes to,</span><span class="font7"> not from compulsion, but because his heart cries out for the privilege of knowing Him and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be said by these that are crying out for liberty that they too are devoted to the Lord, and that they have no desire but to do His will. Very well. Then let them come back and find within the ranks of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in the earth the opportunities for selfsacrifice that they have fled. There is room for all and work for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the ark was in process of building God did not set Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth each at building a little ark of his own. He knew what He wanted to do and proceeded along a single line, the one that finally got results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it came time to deliver Israel out of Egypt God did not send 57 varieties of the elders of Israel into Pharaoh’s court. He </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font7"> them, all right, but He held them back and used them for honorable work of another kind. The ones He used were those of His own selection, best fitted for the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Israel had crossed the Red Sea and started on her march to the promised land God did not say to the people, “Now you have your liberty; just go ahead into Canaan by any route you please, and under any leadership you please, and I will watch over you, order or no order.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are bound to recognize the principle that God keeps His people together. Though the Israelites were often in bondage they were preserved as a people until the great dispersion, because God was pleased to use them for a purpose. Indeed, to this day the Jews are the most pronouncedly separate people in the world, because God still has a part for them to perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And how about spiritual Israel? Is it God’s purpose that they should be split up into any number of companies, all teaching the same or different things? It is unreasonable to so conclude. “Ye are my witnesses and my servant” does not mean “Ye are my 57 kinds of witnesses and my 57 varieties of servants”. No ’ Our liberty is a higher kind than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The liberty to willingly choose a path that brings much of personal inconvenience and humiliation is the highest kind of liberty there is. There is no finer type of heroism in the world than that wdiich says in all sincerity and truth, “Not my will, but thine, be done,” and is willing to bow in submission to God’s will rather than stumble a single saint or retard for an instant the work He is doing in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These who have separated themselves from us have much to say about intolerance, as if that word were usable in only one direction. Have they not left us because they are intolerant of us? Surely. That is precisely the situation. If they had had the true spirit of tolerance they would be with us today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And if one inquires closely as to what reason there is to suppose that a group of men outside of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has become the repository of the truth which they themselves received through the ministrations of that Society, there is but silence. Neither they nor their apologists can deny where they got the truths they possess, nor can they show where any transfer from the Society to themselves took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Occasionally someone who leaves the Society sees the mistake and comes back. It is a pleasure to conclude with such a letter from Walter R. Siewert and Ida E. Siewert, of Pasadena, California, well known to many of our readers. The letter was addressed to the Oak Street ecclesia of Los Angeles and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in July Brother Rippei’ as secretary of the class wrote extending to me the opportunity of serving further at Sunday afternoon and Wednesday evening meetings. I have delayed answering this invitation, not because I wished to ignore it, but because I wished to be fully convinced in my own mind that I was pursuing the right way, according to my own conscience and convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have now arrived at a conclusion in harmony with which I find it necessary to sever my connections with the class. Since I last met with you I have read carefully and prayerful!}' </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> (Books I and II), many issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> I had neglected or not understood, and have reread much of what I had read previously, but then, not with an open mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My study and observations during this interim reveal to me most emphatically that in order to be fully devoted to the Lord and his cause, I must enlist all my efforts to serve God, with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, for the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Since leaving the Watch Tower I, like many others, have not grown in the ‘grace and knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ’. In fact my study and searching of the Scriptures was greatly neglected, and my zeal abated, so that I did not even maintain my former vital relationship with the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2.</span><span class="font5"> Looking over the course of those groups which have separated themselves from the Society during the last fourteen years, not a single group is effectively preaching the ‘gospel of the kingdom’. From the amount of witnessing done for the Lord’s kingdom by these groups, the world would not even know that the Lord purposed to have a kingdom, to say nothing of giving them information about it. The Society, however, is giving out that message in a way that abundantly betokens God’s blessing upon the effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. God has declared that ‘the day of God’s vengeance’ must be declared to the world before Armageddon, the great battle of God Almighty. I hear nobody, anywhere, lifting up a voice against Satan and his wicked organization, except the Watch Tower and those associated with it. While God could raise up the stones to speak His message, from all appearances He has not chosen to do it that way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. My association with separate groups reveals that while there are those who are honestly seeking for the Truth and for spiritual balance, there are others whose fruits disclose that their hearts are becoming embittered, and who are not at all improving their spiritual condition, by the much reading of questionable and vicious literature which emanates from sources afflicted with personal grievances. The Scriptures say “evil communications corrupt good manners”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Since returning to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society I enjoy again “the peace which passeth all understanding”. I am rejoicing in the knowledge acquired of prophecies now going into fulfilment, and am filled with a renewed zeal to preach the Kingdom, the only hope of the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">While I have written very frankly to you in explaining my position., I have only the kindest feelings for all, and the greatest wish of my heart is that all of you who are truly seeking the Lord’s way might find it as I have. If at any time I can be of service to any of you in this connection, I shall be most happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Germane Questions </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Roy D. Goodrich (Florida)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font7">HE article “Germs, the Modern Superstition”, by Dr. E. H. Dresden, in a recent issue of your esteemed journal, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> has been read with much interest. There is a golden thread of truth that runs throughout this article, and no doubt the destruction of fancifu<sup>1 </sup>and superstitious fears among the people will be for their good, particularly if truth be substituted therefor. If certain serum sellers and inoculation mongers should strenuously object, let the very reasonable hope be expressed that many of them are merely blinded and not dishonest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before accepting all of Dr. Dresden’s statements on this interesting subject, in their entirety, however, I find myself in need of the answers to some questions which have arisen in my mind, and which, so far as I am aware, have , never been answered by Dr. Dresden or his germ-eating colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps many other readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> finding themselves in this same predicament, will be glad to consider some of these questions, in connection with the suggestion that perhaps this new and verdant school of doctors, though not superstitious, have much weakened their case by the common errors of exaggeration and the making of unsupported statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of us are so constituted that we require competent evidence and proof or else the proverbial “grain of salt” to facilitate us in the swallowing of large and unusual things as this idea that germs have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">absolutely nothing</span><span class="font7"> to do with causing disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of sad experience with disease and death, it was at first found impossible or impracticable to dig the Panama Canal. Was that great project made possible by the cleaning out of germs or by the mere chasing of superstition from the zone ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many investigators have traced and retraced, under the microscope, the life history of the malaria germ as it is found by them in the sick mosquito, and in the sick humanity bitten by said sick mosquito.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At least they all tell us what they have seen, show us pictures of what they have actually observed, and all the various investigators corroborate one another perfectly, that the periodic chills and fever correspond exactly to the periodicity in the life history of the germs carried by sick mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are all of these investigators liars? Yea, more, have they formed a world-wide conspiracy to lie alike? Explain why it is that people who do not get bitten by sick mosquitoes never have malaria, and those who do receive such bites often do have malaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This new lig*ht on germs not having yet arisen, and measles being prevalent in a light form, my mother sent me to the nearest neighbor, a quarter of a mile awmy, at a tender age, in order that I might “catch” the measly thing and be for ever over with it. It was a cold day, and my girl friend, five years my senior, with the measles, was kindling a fire in a smoky stove. I wondered if they would catch all right in all that smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">My grandma and all the other little boys’ grandmas as well as Dr. McGrew predicted the number of days (nine, I believe it was), till I would break out and get sick. I had never been confined to the bed (after I learned the art of crawling out of it) in my half dozen years before that, nor in my nearly forty years since that have I ever been confined to it more than </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">day or so at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the nine days rolled around. I stayed in bed. My hands were mottled with pink and my mouth tasted like a barnyard. Mama’s nice broth was rotten; our good well water tasted as if it issued from a sewer. How sick, and hot and restless and miserable I was! Only Mama can tell how many dozen times a day her weary steps responded to my cry, “Mama! Mama! I want a drink!” How awful and disappointing was every one of those drinks! I was a sick boy; I had the measles I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now a very germane question: Who is really superstitious, Mama, Grandma and good old Dr. McGrew, or the man who contends that this active little boy ate too much white bread or something else during those particular nine days, and that he would have had the same breaking out and sickness anyhow, regardless of his visit to his girl friend; and that if there were any measly germs around, they were only acting as benefactors to eat up and dispose of some alleged but unseen, untouched, and unknown “poison”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All will freely admit that the little boy’s eating was imperfect enough. But why did those particular nine days of bad eating produce such notable and definitely predicted results, while more than thirty years of exactly similar bad eating, both before and after, produced nothing of the kind? Is there a better or less superstitious answer to this question than &quot;germs”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am sick from a “cold”, whatever that is. I have a terrible cough, my eyeballs pain me, and I have been compelled to lie around most of the time for a week, and am unable to be about my Father's kingdom work. Dr. Dresden accuses me in these words: “It is your own fault, because you alone are responsible for the condition of your body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recalling that that is exactly what Bildad and Zophar and Eliphaz told poor old Job, and that it is recorded that they were all “physicians of no value”, I arise in my misery to ask in behalf of myself and my millions of cosufferers, Upon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">what authority</span><span class="font7"> are we sufferers thus accused?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for myself I have done my best for thirty years to try to learn how to run this body of mine. I have read every issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> from its first to date and have tried to put into practice every practicable health suggestion therein which seemed to have application to my need, and have derived very great benefit therefrom. The result was that in January I had the best health enjoyed for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everybody around was coughing, sneezing and spitting. As I worked from house to house and from day to day they very often did these things directly in my face, and I was not to blame. In February I began to have symptoms of “catching” it. I warded these off to the best of my ability, dietetically and otherwise. I managed to keep on going while others were sick in bed by the dozens, and others sneezing and coughing at me who were not in bed, till now in April it has me “on the shelf”, yet not down in bed as it has the “bad eaters”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prove to me, if you can, by physical facts and logic that these coughings and sneezings which I have been compelled to breathe in every day for months have nothing to do with my present suffering? If the germs in my sore throat are benefactors to me, how is it that my germ-destroying atomizer gives me so much temporary relief, so that 1 have been able to keep on keeping on from day to day for so long?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If, as alleged, all the germ diseases are in fact caused, not by the germs, but by the garbage called “food” which we eat, how is it to be explained that the same perennial garbage consumption by a community produces only flu at one time, measles at another, typhoid at another, and so on? Mere universal wrong eating should produce a universal and constant potpourri of all kinds of diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why then do they occur in great epidemics, of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one disease</span><span class="font7"> only? Again, if tubercle bacilli and all the rest are mere benevolent scavengers, how is it that we have so many </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">distinctly different</span><span class="font7"> diseases? I have inside information on the fact that there are more things wrong with men than garbage-itis. My measles and my cold are absolutely different both in nature and cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Nay, verily,” comes the fiat of some doctor, “garbage-itis is the one and only disease!” All right, Doctor, I do not wish to quarrel with one who is learned. Will you please tell me why I still have garbage-itis, since I have corrected my living and eating according to your schedule, conscientiously and for years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Please also tell me why it is that you are using glasses, and false teeth, and require to use a toupee and hair dye? How may I cure my garbage-itis, and avoid my own future use of these adjuncts of death? In other words, Doctor, tell me how I can beat my Creator, who has decreed, “Dying thou shalt die”? I am answered with becoming silence!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But to the more directly germane questions. How are the two following experiences, and the multiplied millions like them, to be explained without superstition? It was two days before Friday the 13th, and on Armistice Day, nineteen years before there was any such day. I was playing shinney and received a deep threecornered cut on my temple, from another boy’s club. I have always thought he aimed a. little too high to hit the block, but some of my readers may not concur in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was washed off in the filthy school washpan and bound up in the towel that had hung by the washpan for untold weeks. A couple of hours later good old clumsy Dr. McGrew was doing his best to sew<sup>T</sup> me up. Results: (1) Two weeks of misery and pus formation; (2) both eyes swollen completely shut, though I could still see to get around by pulling the best eye open with a finger; (3) an ugly scar for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty years later, in spite of all this, I had gotten me a beautiful wife. Both of us had been pasted up internally with white flour and other things for over thirty years; less than a dozen issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> had as yet come off</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the press, and we had never learned that germs were a superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just as she was about to go out in the great initial subscription campaign for that journal, the wife suffered a very severe blow on the forehead from a stick of wood that was not a shinney club, resulting in a deep cut two inches or more in length. I immediately gathered her into the house, with her broken glasses, and omitting the dirty towel and washpan, the delay, the doctor and his bill, I proceeded scientifically, as I thought, against our enemies the germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I cut out a good-sized piece of wide adhesive tape, rounded the corners, and lit a candle, I held the old-fashioned stick of homemade Uncle Pcely White’s sticking Salve (akin to grafting wax) in the open flame of the candle to soften it, while the germs on it shrieked in their last agonies. When this hot, sticky salve had been smeared in a wide line down the center of the adhesive, I dried the skin about the wound as best I could with antiseptic and cotton, stuck one side of the adhesive well down on one side of the cut, and with it pulled the wound tightly together and slammed the adhesive down tight on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus I sealed my wife’s dirty blood ( ?) and her undietetic blood-stream on the inside, while all doctors, drugs, dietitians, germs and superstitions about them were excluded absolutely. Even the day of week and month and phase of moon were ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the results? An hour after the accident my wife was all rigged up, hat drawn down slightly, and starting out after more </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions, and no one knew of her accident. Additionally, she suffered no pain, soreness, swelling, inflammation, pus formation, misery or expense, from the wound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ten days later, when the plaster fell off, there was no evidence of putrid blood or other garbage either inside or outside her head. When the fine pink line of new tissue had had time to fade out white, she had so little scar that few if any of her friends have ever seen it unless their attention was first directed to its existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the light of these two above-cited cases, and the millions of others like them, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">each of which is a proof that germs cause pus and suffering,</span><span class="font7"> how are the germ-eating doctors, whoso brains cannot be infected with such scientific proof, going to protect themselves from the accusation that their new unproven “benevolent scavenger theory” of the germ is in fact the modern superstition? </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Al</span><span class="font7">l logical and enlightened minds must admit that it is modern and unproven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So far as known, everybody agrees that syphilis results from gross immorality. If germs do not cause disease, how do moral people get this disease through an abrasion of the skin? Those who keep statistics agree that upward of 85 percent of the male population of the U.S.A, either have or have had another venereal disease. If this disease is not caused by germs received by wrong-doing, then how is it that none of us who walk straight ever get it, no matter what food or superstition we swallow?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now let us ask about Dr. Powell and his germeating comrades. Have they ever tried bubonic plague germs? Do they wash and eat freely with lepers? Do they use the common wash basin, towel and drinking cup with syphilitics, especially<sup>7</sup> when their hands and face are badly scratched with briers? And if not, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have they tried the ‘holy<sup>7</sup> waters’ furnished at the heathen temples of Burmah and India without boiling them? Grant it that they have done or can do all this, with their specially<sup>7</sup> well groomed physiques. Does that prove that they<sup>7 </sup>have good sense, or that germs do not cause disease and death among the rest of the race less physically<sup>7</sup> perfect? Millions of scrawny’ Asiatics have drunk from these ‘holy’ cholera wells and have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps a few Occidental germ-eaters could get by<sup>7</sup> with it also. But what shall we conclude about the disobedient tourist who clandestinely drinks (perhaps superstitiously), and who is uniformly<sup>7</sup> left behind the party, under the sod or the waves? Shall we say that disobedience to a travel agency’s rule instantly creates so much internal garbage that even the holy cholera germs cannot eat it up fast enough to save the patient? Or would that be superstition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the fact that all leading authorities of all schools of health and healing are notoriously<sup>7</sup> and increasingly<sup>7</sup> irreverent toward Jehovah God, is there any<sup>7</sup> evidence that Satan has not overreached all of these schools, in a vain attempt to make good his word, “Ye shall not surely<sup>7</sup> die”? Be that as it may, let creation be assured that Jehovah’s word, without superstition, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">shall stand:</span><span class="font7"> “Thou shalt surely’ die.” Only by Jehovah’s provision for deliverance from death can mankind get life and health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his great book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font7"> Judge Rutherford says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries man has searched for the fountain of eternal youth that he might forever enjoy health, peace and endless happiness. That great secret has ever been with Jehovah God. His time has come to reveal it to man, and to open to the vision of all who desire to know, the way to everlasting life on earth. Jesus said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And these statements are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">true,</span><span class="font7"> not because Judge Rutherford made them, but because Judge Rutherford is a man big enough to leave off his own opinion and his own and other men’s wisdom and cite his fellow men to the authoritative word of Jehovah God, the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But if that statement be true, it proves conclusively that all doctors of all worldly schools, in their game of hide and seek for health, not only are not getting “warm” but are getting rapidly “colder” as they grope further and further from Jehovah God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course this does not apply<sup>7</sup> to any doctor as an individual; for even if he be a true Christian he will surely<sup>7</sup> do the very best he knows how, according to his best knowledge as a doctor, to relieve the suffering of his patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The point is that his best knowledge as a doctor, of whatever school or combination of schools, is as far from the ultimate and everlasting relief of his patient as Satan’s kingdom of darkness is from God’s kingdom of light and life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime, why<sup>7</sup> take doctors of this vain world’s wisdom too seriously? Why not look to righteous Job in his affliction, and while doing all of our eating and drinking and breathing and sleeping to the'glory of God as best we may, make sure to maintain our integrity before Jehovah God, that in due time we may by<sup>7</sup> His favor be granted life, with the present turmoil of confusion and death caskets for ever destroyed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some Free Dental Advice</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">N</span><span class="font7">OW I’ll give you a little advice about your teeth, and I'll tell you about the dentifrice that I have used for many years, and still have a large bottle of it on my wash stand, and I shall continue to use it the rest of my life because it is very effective and very cheap. Just a few years ago the dentifrice slogan was: “Use our dentifrice because a clean tooth never decays.” They are ashamed to use that slogan now, because no matter how clean you keep your teeth on the outside, if you do not keep your body clean inside, and if you do not eat the food that contains the mineral salts to nourish your teeth, food that contains a little silicon and plenty of calcium and phosphorus, your teeth will decay; and they decay from the inside, and not from the outside. They<sup>7</sup> decay because the blood which nourishes the teeth has not sufficient mineral salts to supply<sup>7</sup> the needs for the teeth, and that is what causes the decay of teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How<sup>7</sup>ever, you should keep your teeth clean, and you can go to the drug store and tell the druggist you want a quarter of a pound of prepared chalk—if I didn’t want to tell you what it was I’d call it “creta praeparata”, and write a prescription for it and charge you $3.00 and the druggist would charge you $1.50 for a quarter</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. P. L. Clark (Illinois)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of a pound; but just go in and say<sup>7</sup>, &quot;Give me a quarter of a pound of prepared chalk,” and he’ll think you know your business, and he’ll charge you ten cents or fifteen cents or twenty cents probably, less than you would have to pay for any large size tube of any<sup>7</sup> dentifrice, and it will last your family and yourself anywhere from one to three or six months. Just take it in your mouth and scrub your teeth with it and rinse it out, and if you want the bubbling effect just rub your tooth brush on a little Castile soap, or Ivory<sup>7</sup> soap, and wash your teeth with that and the prepared chalk. For many years prepared chalk was the basis for most of the dentifrice made, and there is no use in your paying a fancy price for scented prepared chalk or any other dentifrice. After brushing your teeth with prepared chalk take a teaspoonful of salt in your mouth and hold it there for five or ten minutes while you are dressing. Then rinse out your mouth and see how fine and clean it feels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[Another tooth powder that will not cost you 50c a tube, but is just as good as if it did, is a mixture of common baking soda and common salt. But the American people do not like to save money: they like to spend it.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom of Heaven on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font7">T IS often supposed that the kingdom of heaven is a far-off, mysterious something to which people pass at death, provided they have been good, especially in the theological sense of the word. To show that it means something quite different and that the kingdom of God has a great deal to do with this earth and its affairs is the purpose of this discussion. The Bible is the only book to which we can look for authoritative information. What supposedly learned and scholarly men have said on the subject does not amount to much unless it squares with the Bible. We will therefore go direct to the source and bring forth such passages of the Word of God as have a bearing on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus, was the first who used the expression “the kingdom of heaven”, as recorded in Matthew 3:2. He said, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” What did he mean? In order to get the proper background for the subject we shall have to look back in history to the time when G od chose the people of Israel to be a special and separate people by whom other peoples were to be pointed to God and His purposes. God told them, “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.”'—Ex. 19:5, 6, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As long as the people of Israel obeyed God’s commandments they were signally blessed; but they did not long remain in the attitude of obedience. Rather, they began to worship idols and in other ways to disregard God’s commandments. . The sure result of this course of action was degradation and disintegration. Because of their disobedience God’s protection and care were withdrawn from them and they frequently suffered oppression from their enemies. Time and again God would raise up a deliverer who would be used to defeat the enemy and thus free the people from their oppressors. In this manner He showed the nation of Israel that He himself was their unseen King who directed their affairs. This they failed fully to appreciate, however, and the time came when they desired a visible ruler like other nations had. They did not realize that in making this request they were really rejecting God as King, but that was what their demand implied. Thus God said to Samuel, “They have not rejected thee, </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font7">they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.”—1 Sam. 8: 7, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the people in this way virtually rejected God as King, He did not reject them, </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font7">gave them to understand that He would </span><span class="font6">still </span><span class="font7">remain their unseen Ruler, and that their king would represent Him, occupying his position of authority by divine appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Accordingly the kings of Israel are said to have sat upon the throne of the kingdom of </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font7">Lord. (1 Chron. 28: 5; 2 Chron. 13: 8) God </span><span class="font6">con</span><span class="font7">tinued to supervise the affairs of the nation, </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font7">it frequently required the exercise of faith </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">appreciate this fact. The first king of Israel was Saul, who because of disobedience was </span><span class="font6">re</span><span class="font7">jected. David was selected by the Lord to succeed him as king, and it is interesting to note that this kingly line continued down to the time of the captivity, a period of nearly 500 years. This was in fulfilment of God’s promise </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">David that there should not fail him an heir to sit upon the throne as long as the kingdom continued. (2 Chron. 6:16) Although the kings of Israel thus exercised a God-given authority, they frequently abused their powers, and </span><span class="font6">at </span><span class="font7">such times God would warn them through prophets. If they failed to repent, a suitable punishment was administered. But as these punishments were often given by natural means, few of the kings profited by God’s dealings, because they failed to exercise faith in Him. God’s v<sup>T</sup>ays can never be understood by the unbelieving. Faith does not ignore reason, but transcends it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The failure of the kings and people of Israel to abide by the laws of God more and more contradicted the claim that their kingdom constituted God’s kingdom. Rather than representing Him and His laws, they misrepresented Him; and as their wickedness went from bad to worse, severe punishment was inevitable. God permitted the kingdom to be overthrown and the people to be carried away into Babylon. To the last king of the Davidic line He said, “Thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith Jehovah God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: ... I will overturn, overturn, overturn </span><span class="font6">it; </span><span class="font7">and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him,” (Ezek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">21: 25-27) In these prophetic words God stated His purpose to permit the kingdom to be overthrown, and so it was. The kingdom of God on earth there ceased and heathen nations were permitted to hold sway in the earth. None of these heathen nations, however, represented the rule of God. They were not ruling by divine right, nor by divine appointment, but merely by divine tolerance. God permitted, tolerated them to rule, but their rule had in no sense His approval, although He assures us that He frequently overruled the actions of kings and the course of nations so that they might not interfere with the accomplishment of His purposes. The kingdom of God, then, as represented in Israel, ceased when that nation was carried into captivity and their land was desolated. God, however, foretold His purpose to restore that kingdom in the course of time, in due time. He said that it should ‘be no more until He came whose right it was and it would be given to Him’. There were among the people of Israel a faithful few, called “the remnant”, who were greatly encouraged by these assurances of God’s care over them. God strengthened their faith by revealing to Daniel certain details concerning the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the book of Daniel we find a most remarkable prophecy foretelling what must take place before the kingdom should finally be restored. This prophecy was given from two standpoints. One was revealed by means of a dream given to Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty monarch of the great world power then in control of the civilized world. The meaning of the dream could not be discerned, however, until Daniel, one of the faithful of Israel, interpreted it. Daniel did this not of his own wisdom, but by God’s power, which he freely acknowledged. In this way the God of Israel was brought into prominence before the people. God left not himself without witnesses. According to Nebuchadnezzar’s dream the great world powers are represented by a great and imposing statue, the head being of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and thighs of brass, and the legs of iron. The feet of the image were of iron mingled ■with clay. When the king awoke in the morning he had forgotten the dream, but Daniel was given a vision which enabled him to interpret the king’s dream. The head of gold represented Satan, the god of this world, pictured in Nebuchadnezzar who was then ruler. This was to be followed by an arrangement inferior to the head, represented by the “silver” portion of the image. This pictured the mighty spirit creatures who are referred to as princes in Satan’s organization (Dan. 10:13, 20), after which came the “brass” (properly translated “copper”), picturing the host of evil angels cooperating with Satan in debauching the human family. After that came a still inferior metal, iron, picturing the human or visible rulers of the Devil’s organization. The dream further showed a stone cut out of the mountain -without hands. This stone struck the image upon the feet, so that it was ground to powder and carried away by the winds so that it was no longer found. This, Daniel explained, represented God’s kingdom that -would be set up lay the God of heaven and which would destroy the Devil’s entire organization. This kingdom was to stand forever and would not be left to other people. This, then, would be the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God established, of course, in the earth. It would be given to Him whose right it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another of Daniel’s visions God’s kingdom is represented by a man or son of man, thus shoaving that it would be vastly superior to the great kingdoms which preceded it. Daniel says, “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroved.” —Dan. 7:13,14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are now able to understand what John the Baptist meant when he came preaching, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” It was the kingdom of God which Daniel had foretold. It was near; within reach, we might say. John’s work but introduced Jesus, who came announcing the same good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God, is at hand.’ The King was already there. Jesus himself was the King. He was of the line of David, through His mother Mary. And before His birth the angel who announced His coming had said, “He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.”—Luke 1: 30-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is at once manifest that David’s throne and kingdom pertained to earth and that it represented the authority of Jehovah God. Someone will perhaps object in that Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” True, but He did not say that His kingdom was not to be on earth. On the contrary, He told His disciples to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven’; therefore, the kingdom of heaven on earth. What, then, did Jesus mean when He said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” This word in the Greek is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kosmos,</span><span class="font7"> which means an organization or arrangement of things. The world to which Jesus referred was that organization or arrangement of things which was dominated by Satan, who is called the prince or god of this world. Jesus’ kingdom had nothing in common with that world; but He speaks of a world to come, and in that world to come God’s will shall be done on earth as in heaven. Peter says, “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) Nor does this mean that either earth or heaven will literally pass away, because the Bible tells us that “the earth abideth for ever”. (Eccl. 1:4) But what, then, is implied by “new heavens” ? Are not the heavens satisfactory? Call to mind the Apostle Paul’s assertion that the Christian contends not with flesh and blood, but with -wicked spirits in heavenly places, and it will at once be evident that God’s will has not been done either in earth or in heaven; for in heaven the wicked fallen angels, under the leadership of Satan, have been exercising their powers in opposing, either openly or under cover, the purposes of God. For wise reasons God did not hinder this, but He foretold that the time would come when an entirely new arrangement would be introduced over which Jesus would be Lord and King. Jesus’ kingdom, therefore, is not of Satan’s establishment or arrangement of things, but is of the new<sup>7</sup> organization, which alone is to prevail in all the earth when Satan’s “world” or arrangement shall have fully ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another question: If Jesus held the title to the kingdom at His first advent, and if ‘the kingdom of heaven was then at hand’, v<sup>7</sup>hy did not that kingdom come into power at that time ? First of all, because it was not God’s due time for it to begin the exercise of its power. The immediate obstacle to its establishment was the ruling class of Israel at that time. This class -was composed of scribes, Pharisees, lavwers and priests, corresponding to the political, commercial and religious leaders of our day. Note ■what Jesus said to them, “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites' for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” (Matt. 23:13) Jesus was the King and represented the Kingdom. Those wdio joined themselves to Him, acknowledging His kingship, were thereby entering the Kingdom. This the religious and other leaders of the people sought to prevent. They refused to acknowledge Jesus because He did not measure up to their ideas of what a king should be, or rather because they did not believe the Avorq. of God. They asked Jesus about the coming of the Kingdom, and were doubtless surprised by the answer that it was already among them. This was true, for it was represented in Jesus himself as King, and His disciples as subjects. Our English Bible translates Jesus’ words as though He said, “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here I or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ivithin you.”</span><span class="font7"> But this was not properly translated. What Jesus really said is, “The kingdom of God is in your midst,” as is shown in the revised version. And so it was; but instead of exercising its power it suffered violence and opposition. (Matt. 11:12) Because the scribes and Pharisees,, representing the nation as a whole, rejected the Kingdom message at that time, Jesus told them, “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21: 43) And to what nation was it to be given? The Bible makes this plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Pentecost the Kingdom message began to go to the Gentiles. It is distinctly said that Paul preached the kingdom of God. Indeed this was the general theme of the Lord and all the disciples. In Acts 15:14 we are told that God would turn to the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name; and those who responded to the gospel message were said to be ‘translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God’s dear Son’. (Col. 1:13) So also the Apostle Peter writes, “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation [a people for God’s own purpose], that ye should shew forth the praises [excellencies] of </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: ■which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.” (1 Pet. 2:9,10) Peter here addresses those Gentiles who, as faithful followers of Jesus, inherited the promises which were once the special portion of Israel, but which they lost because they refused the King whom God had appointed. This is the nation to which the kingdom of God is to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, be it noted, the Kingdom was not established in power. In a sense the followers of Jesus represented His kingdom, but still it was true that “the kingdom of heaven” had to endure violence and opposition, as is evident from tije experiences of Jesus and of the apostles and disciples, as well as of all such who have, since those days, faithfully followed their example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time, however, was to come when the kingdom of God would be established in power. The apostles knew this and thought at first that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. But Jesus spoke unto them a parable to show that it would not then be established. In this parable, or word picture, He represents himself as a young nobleman who must travel into a far country to receive the kingdom and who at length returns having been invested with authority. So Jesus left the scene of His labors and went away, to heaven itself, there to wait until God’s time to give Him instruction to take action against the Devil and his institutions, the present evil world. Jesus was told, “Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly before His departure Jesus gave a prophetic outline of events that would take place at the time of the establishment of His kingdom. He pointed out that it would not be established until the end of the world; meaning, of course, that organization of things of which Satan has been the great overlord. This must end before Jesus can enter upon His reign, which will then extend throughout all the earth. Those who have been His faithful followers shall then be with Him where He is; for He said to them, “If I go ... I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” (John 14:3) Inasmuch as they suffer with Him, they shall also reign with Him, (2 Tim. 2:12) Jesus promised them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be [overjoyed]: for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matt. 5:11,12) From these and many other scriptures it is manifest that the Kingdom authority will be from heaven, and that the rulers will exercise that authority from heaven, for that is where both Jesus and His coregents will be. But this does not alter the fact that they shall reign on the earth as is shown in Revelation 5: 9,10. The revised version of these verses remarkably corroborates the statement that God has visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. This is the true church of Christ. It has not reigned in this world, but shall reign in the world to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom will have its earthly representatives. These are styled princes, while the • members of the Christ body are called “kings and priests”. Reference to these princes is found in the 45th Psalm. There the true church is represented under the figure of a queenly bride. She is told that those who were once looked up to as her fathers are now to be her children and will be appointed princes in all the earth. Isaiah 32:1 also makes mention of these: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” Who are these? The patriarchs and the prophets of the Old Testament times. Since they lived before the time of Christ, they could not be His followers. They could not suffer with Him; consequently they cannot reign with Him. But they are to receive high honor under the Kingdom administration. Thus Jesus said to some in His day who had greater opportunities, “Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.” (Luke 13:27,28) Nevertheless, Jesus shows that the saints shall have a higher honor when He says, “Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”—Matt. 11:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How wonderfully complete will be the appointments of that glorious kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray! There will be the King with all power in heaven and in earth, who as the great overlord will supervise all the affairs of the Kingdom for the honor of God’s name and the blessing of all families of the earth. Then there will be those who shall reign with Him for the thousand years. They shall be kings and priests unto God and of His Christ. It is for this reason that Jesus is called the King of kings and Lord of lords. His victorious followers are the kings and lords over whom He is appointed as supreme. Finally, there will be the princes who will represent the Kingdom in all the earth with perfect ability to administer the varied concerns of a world-wide government. The center for the earthly representatives of the Kingdom will probably be at Jerusalem, the city of the great King, which has specially represented His name among men. Jerusalem shall then no longer be trodden down of the Gentiles, but it shall be established above all other kingdoms and exalted above all other governments, as is shown in Isaiah 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even now we see Jerusalem arising from the dust. Those Jews who are returning to the holy land inspired by the promises of God will undoubtedly be richly blessed and will be among the first to receive the benefits of the kingdom of heaven; and ere long the whole world will respond to the floods of light and joy that shall go forth from that center. Thus the kingdom of God will come. First the living, and then the dead, shall participate in its blessings; for they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away, and there shall be no more death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">npHE business of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is to preach the good news of the imminent establishment of God’s kingdom on the earth. As each passing day adds its testimony to the futility of every human endeavor to bring peace and prosperity to the peoples of earth, and as each day brings nearer the execution of the judgments written by Jehovah against the nations and leaders of Christendom, we feel more keenly our responsibility of warning the people of the rapidly approaching crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only way of escape in the &quot;day of Jehovah’s anger” is to seek righteousness and a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. In order to fulfil our obligation to place the message of God’s kingdom on earth within the reach of all who really want to know, we have worked and planned and figured, so that now we are enabled to announce another reduction in the cost of Judge Rutherford’s books. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society has its own printingplant and manufactures its own publications. It is not organized for any pecuniary gain.

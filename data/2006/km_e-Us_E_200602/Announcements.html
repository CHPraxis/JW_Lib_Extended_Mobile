<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since April has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 2006 Memorial season will be entitled “Is God Still in Control?” See the related announcement in the September 2005 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The article on page 6 entitled “Enjoy Our Study of <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?” </em>will be considered at the Service Meeting the week of April 3. Please save that article and the accompanying study schedule.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Regional Building Committees have sample corporation and trusteeship documents to be used for congregation property ownership. When it becomes necessary to update these legal papers, the elders should obtain the latest samples from their regional committee.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters.</p>

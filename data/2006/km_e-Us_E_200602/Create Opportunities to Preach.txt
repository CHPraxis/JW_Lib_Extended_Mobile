Create Opportunities to Preach
1 The Christian congregation is made up of people with a wide variety of circumstances. Yet, we are united in our determination to praise Jehovah. (Ps. 79:13) If poor health or other challenging circumstances limit our share in proclaiming the good news, how can we create opportunities to preach?
2 In Daily Activities: Jesus took advantage of his everyday dealings with people to give a witness. He spoke to Matthew while passing a tax office, to Zacchaeus while traveling, and to a Samaritan woman while resting. (Matt. 9:9; Luke 19:1-5; John 4:6-10) In our daily activities, we too can turn an ordinary conversation into a witness. Having a Bible handy, along with tracts or brochures, will encourage us to be ready to speak about our hope.​—1 Pet. 3:15.
3 Does impaired mobility limit your participation in the door-to-door work? Be alert to opportunities to witness to visiting medical personnel and others with whom you come in contact. (Acts 28:30, 31) If circumstances often keep you at home, have you tried witnessing by telephone or by letter? One sister regularly writes to non-Witness family members. She includes encouraging thoughts from the Bible and experiences she has had while witnessing.
4 At Work or School: Our desire to praise Jehovah will also move us to create opportunities to plant seeds of truth at work or school. An eight-year-old publisher shared with his class what he read in Awake! about the moon. After learning where he got the information, his teacher began accepting The Watchtower and Awake! on a regular basis. At the workplace, our simply keeping a copy of the Bible Teach book where others can see it may prompt questions and lead to a witness.
5 Can you think of ways to create opportunities to preach in your daily activities? By making the most of our circumstances, may we strive each day to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise.”​—Heb. 13:15.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The Christian congregation is made up of people with a wide variety of circumstances. Yet, we are united in our determination to praise Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:79:13-19:79:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 79:13</a>) If poor health or other challenging circumstances limit our share in proclaiming the good news, how can we create opportunities to preach?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>In Daily Activities: </strong>Jesus took advantage of his everyday dealings with people to give a witness. He spoke to Matthew while passing a tax office, to Zacchaeus while traveling, and to a Samaritan woman while resting. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:9-40:9:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 9:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:1-42:19:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 19:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> John 4:6-10</a>) In our daily activities, we too can turn an ordinary conversation into a witness. Having a Bible handy, along with tracts or brochures, will encourage us to be ready to speak about our hope.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Does impaired mobility limit your participation in the door-to-door work? Be alert to opportunities to witness to visiting medical personnel and others with whom you come in contact. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:30-44:28:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 28:30, 31</a>) If circumstances often keep you at home, have you tried witnessing by telephone or by letter? One sister regularly writes to non-Witness family members. She includes encouraging thoughts from the Bible and experiences she has had while witnessing.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>At Work or School: </strong>Our desire to praise Jehovah will also move us to create opportunities to plant seeds of truth at work or school. An eight-year-old publisher shared with his class what he read in <em>Awake! </em>about the moon. After learning where he got the information, his teacher began accepting <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>on a regular basis. At the workplace, our simply keeping a copy of the <em>Bible Teach </em>book where others can see it may prompt questions and lead to a witness.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Can you think of ways to create opportunities to preach in your daily activities? By making the most of our circumstances, may we strive each day to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 13:15</a>.</p>

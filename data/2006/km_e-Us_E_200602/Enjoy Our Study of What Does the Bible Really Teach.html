<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>An exciting feature of the “Godly Obedience” District Conventions was the release of the book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>We will soon be using it extensively in our field ministry, especially when we conduct home Bible studies. Therefore, we need to become well acquainted with this new publication. That will be possible because we will be studying it at the Congregation Book Study beginning the week of April 17, 2006.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Congregation Book Study overseer will call attention to the questions that appear at the start of each chapter. Then the study will be conducted by using the questions at the bottom of the page. Key scriptures will be read and discussed, and the box “What the Bible Teaches” at the end of each chapter will be helpful in reviewing the material because the box contains the Scriptural answers to the chapter’s introductory questions. You will enjoy commenting, since this book covers subjects in a clear, simple, and interesting way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The appendix of this book provides details on various topics. We will be able to use this material when Bible students need more information on a certain subject. Portions of the appendix will at times be covered during the Congregation Book Study. All the appendix material on a topic will be read by the book study reader, and the longer articles can be covered in sections. Study questions do not appear in the appendix. But the overseer can draw comments from those present by asking questions that highlight main points.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Studies of the <em>Bible Teach </em>book will move along briskly at the Congregation Book Study. We are not expected to keep that pace when we study this publication with others, particularly if they have little or no Bible knowledge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:28-44:26:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 26:28, 29</a>) During home Bible studies, we will need to discuss scriptures more thoroughly, explain illustrations, and so forth. So make it your goal to be in attendance every week and to share fully in our study of the book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?</em></p>

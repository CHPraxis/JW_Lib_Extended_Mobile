Show Personal Interest​—By Being Prepared
1 Good preparation for the ministry helps us to show personal interest in others. How so? When we are well prepared, we are less preoccupied with our presentation and so can give greater attention to the householder. Further, it helps us to overcome nervousness and allows us to speak from the heart. How, though, can we prepare an effective presentation?
2 Use a Presentation That Fits: Select from the January 2006 Our Kingdom Ministry one of the suggested presentations that is appropriate for your area, and consider how you can put it in your own words. Adapt it to your territory. For example, if you are likely to meet people of a certain religious or ethnic background, think of how your presentation can appeal to them. Tailoring your approach to the individuals with whom you speak reflects sincere interest in them.​—1 Cor. 9:22.
3 As you begin using the presentation, continue to refine it. Since the opening words are especially important, note how people respond to your introduction. Does the subject interest them? Do the questions you pose bring a response? If not, make adjustments until you find an approach that works.
4 Memory Aids: Many find it a challenge to remember a presentation when they are at the door. If you find that to be so, have you tried having practice sessions in which you give the presentation out loud to another person? This can help you to get the ideas clearly in mind and present them in a simple, logical manner. It can also prepare you to handle the variety of responses you may get.
5 Another memory aid is to write a short summary of the presentation on an index card and glance at it just before you approach the door. Some find that this brief reminder helps them to be more relaxed and better able to converse with people. In these ways, good preparation can help us to show personal interest in others and thus enhance our presentation of the good news.

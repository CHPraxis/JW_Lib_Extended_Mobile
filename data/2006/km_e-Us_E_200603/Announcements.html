<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Family Happiness </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since April has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held on Wednesday, April 12, 2006. If your congregation normally has meetings on Wednesday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should release the latest issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>as soon as they are received. This will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service. <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>also should be released as soon as it arrives. It may be distributed through the Congregation Book Study arrangement.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The video program <em>Noah​—He Walked With God </em>will be considered at a Service Meeting in May. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Publishers displaced from their homes by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita should call the Houston, Texas, Relief Committee at (713) 334-1914 if they have not already done so. Elders should follow through with those who have relocated to their area to make sure they have called as instructed above.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more planning to visit the United States branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204.

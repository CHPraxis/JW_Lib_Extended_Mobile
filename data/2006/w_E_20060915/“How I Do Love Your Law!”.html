The psalmist sings: “In my heart I have treasured up your <em>saying.” </em>“For your <em>statutes </em>I shall show a fondness.” “My soul is crushed with longing for your <em>judicial decisions </em>all the time.” “Your <em>reminders </em>are what I am fond of.” “I have longed for your <em>orders.” </em>“I shall show a fondness for your <em>commandments </em>that I have loved.” “I will concern myself with your <em>regulations.” </em>“How I do love your <em>law! </em>All day long it is my concern.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:11-19:119:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:16-19:119:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:20-19:119:20" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:24-19:119:24" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:40-19:119:40" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:47-19:119:48" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 47, 48,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="2-7" class="b"> 97</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What heartfelt appreciation the psalmist had for God’s revealed word! Do you feel this way about the message of God’s Word, the Bible? Would you like to cultivate such a fondness for it? If so, you first need to form the habit of reading the Bible regularly, daily if possible. Jesus Christ said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4</a>) Second, you should meditate on what you read. Reflecting upon the truth about God, his qualities, his will, and his purpose will enhance your appreciation for the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:5-19:143:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 143:5</a>) And by all means, apply its sound advice in day-to-day living.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:17-43:13:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 13:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How will cultivating a fondness for what the Bible says benefit you? “Happy are those observing [God’s] reminders,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:2-19:119:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:2</a>. The reminders found in the Bible will help you to cope successfully with problems in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>) You will gain wisdom, insight, and understanding, which will help you to ‘restrain your feet from every bad path.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:98-19:119:101" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 119:98-101</a>) Knowing the truth about God and his purpose for the earth will make your life more meaningful and will brighten your hope for the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>

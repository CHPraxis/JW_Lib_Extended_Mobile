<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN A village on the outskirts of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, two ministers were returning home from their preaching activity. As they walked, they saw a beautiful tree. “Ah, a <em>lagani auna!” </em>said the older man. Turning to the younger man, he continued: “That name means ‘yearly tree.’ Unlike many other trees of the tropics, every year it loses its leaves and looks dead. However, when the rains come, it revives, puts forth flowers, and again shows its beauty.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A lesson can be learned from the <em>lagani auna, </em>or royal poinciana, as it is commonly known. According to some authorities, it is counted among the five most beautiful flowering trees in the world. Though it loses its flowers and leaves during the dry season, the tree stores a supply of water. Its root system is strong and can grow around rocks that are deep underground. By this means, it anchors itself against strong winds. In short, it thrives by making the most of difficult circumstances.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We may find ourselves in circumstances that test the quality of our faith. What will help us to endure? Like the <em>lagani auna, </em>we can drink in and store up the life-giving water of God’s Word. We should also cling tightly to ‘our rock,’ Jehovah, as well as to his organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:22:3-10:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:3</a>) Truly, the <em>lagani auna </em>is an attractive reminder that even in a harsh environment, we can maintain our spiritual strength and beauty if we take advantage of the provisions that Jehovah makes available. By doing so, we will “inherit the promises” that he has made, including the promise of everlasting life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:12-58:6:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

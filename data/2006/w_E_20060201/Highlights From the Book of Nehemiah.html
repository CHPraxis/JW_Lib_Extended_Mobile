<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Nehemiah</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">TWELVE years have passed since the closing events recorded in the Bible book of Ezra took place. The time is now near for “the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem”<wbr />—the occurrence that marks the beginning of the 70 weeks of years leading up to the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>) The book of Nehemiah is a history of God’s people involving the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s wall. It covers a crucial period of over 12 years, from 456 B.C.E. to some time after 443 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by Governor Nehemiah, the book is an exciting account of how true worship is exalted when resolute action is combined with total reliance on Jehovah God. It clearly shows how Jehovah maneuvers matters to have his will accomplished. It is also the story of a strong and courageous leader. The message of the book of Nehemiah provides valuable lessons for all true worshippers today, “for the word of God is alive and exerts power.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Nehemiah is in Shushan the castle, serving King Artaxerxes Longimanus in a trusted position. Upon hearing the news that his people “are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its very gates have been burned with fire,” Nehemiah is deeply disturbed. He fervently prays to God for direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:1:3-16:1:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:3, 4</a>) In time, the king notices Nehemiah’s sadness, and the way opens up for him to go to Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After arriving in Jerusalem, Nehemiah inspects the wall under the cover of darkness, and he reveals to the Jews his plan to rebuild the wall. Construction begins. So does opposition to the work. Under the courageous leadership of Nehemiah, however, “at length the wall [comes] to completion.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:6:15-16:6:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 6:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1:1;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:2:1-16:2:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>2:1</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Is “the twentieth year” mentioned in these two verses counted from the same reference point? </strong>Yes, the 20th year is that of the reign of Artaxerxes the king. However, the method of counting used in these verses is different. Historical evidence points to 475 B.C.E. as the year of Artaxerxes’ ascension to the throne. Since the Babylonian scribes customarily counted the years of the Persian kings’ reign from Nisan (March/April) to Nisan, Artaxerxes’ first regnal year began in Nisan of 474 B.C.E. Hence, the 20th year of rulership mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:2:1-16:2:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a> began in Nisan of 455 B.C.E. The month of Chislev (November/December) mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:1</a> logically was the Chislev of the preceding year<wbr />—456 B.C.E. Nehemiah refers to that month as also falling in the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign. Perhaps in <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>this case, he was counting the years from the accession date of the monarch. It could also be that Nehemiah was counting time by what the Jews today call a civil year, which begins in the month of Tishri, corresponding to September/October. In any case, the year in which the word went out to restore Jerusalem was 455 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:4:17-16:4:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>4:17, 18</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How could a man do the work of rebuilding with just one hand? </strong>For burden bearers this would not be a problem. Once the load was placed on their head or shoulders, they could easily balance it with one hand “while the other hand was holding the missile.” The builders who needed both hands to do their work “were girded, each one with his sword upon his hip, while building.” They were ready to go into action in case of an enemy attack.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:5:7-16:5:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>5:7</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—In what sense did Nehemiah begin “finding fault with the nobles and the deputy rulers”? </strong>These men were exacting usury from their fellow Jews in violation of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:25:36-3:25:36" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Leviticus 25:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:23:19-5:23:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 23:19</a>) Moreover, the interest the lenders were demanding was high. If demanded monthly, “the hundredth” would be equivalent to 12 percent a year. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:5:11-16:5:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:11</a>) It was cruel to impose this on people already heavily burdened with taxes and a food shortage. Nehemiah found fault with the rich in that, using God’s Law, he reproved and rebuked them and thus exposed their wrongdoing.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:6:5-16:6:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>6:5</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Since confidential letters were usually placed in a sealed bag, why did Sanballat send “an open letter” to Nehemiah? </strong>Sanballat may have intended to make public the false charges brought forth by sending them in an open letter. Perhaps he hoped that this would anger Nehemiah so much that he would leave the building work and come to defend himself. Or Sanballat may have thought that the contents of the letter would cause such alarm among the Jews that they would stop their work altogether. Nehemiah refused to be intimidated and calmly continued in his God-assigned work.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">As soon as Jerusalem’s wall is completed, Nehemiah sets up the gates and makes arrangements to secure the city. He proceeds to make a genealogical record of the people. As all the people assemble “at the public square that was before the Water Gate,” Ezra the priest reads the book of the Law of Moses, and Nehemiah and the Levites explain the Law to the people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:1-16:8:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:1</a>) Learning about the Festival of Booths leads to their holding an observance of it with rejoicing.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Another gathering follows, during which “the seed of Israel” make confession of national sins, the Levites review God’s dealings with Israel, and the people take an oath “to walk in the law of the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:9:1-16:9:2" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:10:29-16:10:29" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 10:29</a>) Since Jerusalem is still underpopulated, lots are cast to have 1 of every 10 men living outside the city move into the city.

Uncleanness soon creeps in among the Jews. Upon his return to Jerusalem, Nehemiah takes decisive action to correct the situation.

(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/15:2:1-15:2:65" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><strong>Ezra 2:1-65</strong></a><strong>) </strong>The reason for these variations may be that Ezra and Nehemiah used different source material. For example, the number of those who registered to return may have been different from the number who actually did return. The two records may also have differed because some <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>Jews who were unable to establish their genealogy at the outset did so in time. Both accounts, however, agree on one point: The number of initial returnees was 42,360, apart from slaves and singers.</p>

This requirement stemmed strictly from the need. Large quantities of wood were needed in order to burn the sacrifices on the altar. Apparently, there were not enough Nethinim, who served as non-Israelite temple slaves. Hence, lots were cast to ensure a continuous supply of wood.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:6-16:13:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>13:6</strong></a><strong>, footnote<wbr />—How long was Nehemiah absent from Jerusalem? </strong>The Bible says only that “sometime later,” or “at the end of days,” Nehemiah asked for a leave of absence from the king to return to Jerusalem. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the length of his absence. Upon his return to Jerusalem, though, Nehemiah found that the priesthood was not being supported, nor was the Sabbath law being observed. Many had taken foreign wives, and their offspring did not even speak the language of the Jews. For conditions to deteriorate so much, Nehemiah must have been gone for a long time.</p>

He ‘struck some of them,’ perhaps by ordering judicial action against them. As a symbol of his moral indignation, he ‘pulled out some of their hair.’ He also chased away the grandson of High Priest Eliashib, who had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite.</p>

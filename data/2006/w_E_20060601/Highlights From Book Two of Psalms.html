<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From Book Two of Psalms</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">AS Jehovah’s servants, we expect trials and tests to come our way. “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted,” wrote the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:12</a>) What will help us to endure trials and persecutions, thereby proving our integrity to God?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The second of the five collections of psalms provides that help. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:42:0-19:72:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 42 to 72</a> show us that if we want to endure trials successfully, we must put our complete confidence in Jehovah and learn to wait on him for deliverance. What a valuable lesson that is for us! The message of Book Two of Psalms, like the rest of God’s Word, is indeed “alive and exerts power” even today.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

So intense was the man’s sadness over not being able to worship Jehovah at His sanctuary that ‘his tears became his food day and night’<wbr />—he lost his appetite. Should we not cultivate deep appreciation for worshipping Jehovah in association with fellow believers?</p>

What wonderful blessings are described there<wbr />—abundant peace, the end of oppression and violence, plenty of grain on the earth! Will we be among those who will enjoy these and other Kingdom blessings? We can be if, like the psalmist, we are content to wait on Jehovah, making him our refuge and strength.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">“The prayers of David . . . come to their end” with the words: “Blessed be Jehovah God, Israel’s God, who alone is doing wonderful works. And blessed be his glorious name to time indefinite, and let his glory fill the whole earth. Amen and Amen.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:72:18-19:72:20" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Psalm 72:18-20</a>) Let us likewise wholeheartedly bless Jehovah and praise his glorious name.</p>

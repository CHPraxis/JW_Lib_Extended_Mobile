Help for a Troubled Youth
SIBIA, a 13-year-old schoolgirl in Mexico, noticed that a classmate would often come to school crying. She tried to comfort her. One day Sibia’s classmate confided that her father was an alcoholic and beat her mother.
Sibia relates: “She told me that she did not want to live, that she had even tried to commit suicide. She said that no one loved her and that she felt all alone. I answered that there was Someone who loved her very much, the most important Person in the universe. Then I explained Jehovah’s purpose for mankind.”
Later Sibia gave her classmate the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work and began studying it with her every day during school recess. Gradually the girl changed from being withdrawn and would talk and laugh with others. In a letter to Sibia, the girl wrote: “Thank you for your friendship and understanding. You are like the sister I always wanted to have. Now I know that someone cares about me—Jehovah.”
Perhaps you know a youth who would benefit from the Young People Ask book. Its 39 chapters include the following: “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know if It’s Real Love?” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

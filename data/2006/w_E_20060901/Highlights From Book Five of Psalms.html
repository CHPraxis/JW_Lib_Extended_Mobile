<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From Book Five of Psalms</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE rich may say: “Our sons are like little plants grown up in their youth, our daughters like corners carved in palace style, our garners full, . . . our flocks multiplying by thousands.” Moreover, the wealthy may exclaim: “Happy is the people for whom it is just like that!” In contrast, however, the psalmist says: “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:144:12-19:144:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 144:12-15</a>) How could it be otherwise? Jehovah is the happy God, and happiness is the lot of those worshipping him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11</a>) This truth is made evident in the final collection of divinely inspired songs, consisting of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:107:1-19:150:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalms 107 to 150</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Book Five of Psalms also highlights Jehovah’s superlative qualities, including his loving-kindness, trueness, and goodness. The more insight we gain into God’s personality, the more inclined we are to love and fear him. This, in turn, contributes to our happiness. What a valuable message we find in Book Five of Psalms!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

From the sun’s rising in the east to its setting in the west, the rays of the sun illuminate the entire globe. Likewise, Jehovah is to be praised earth wide. This cannot be accomplished without an organized effort. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have the cherished privilege to praise God and share zealously in the Kingdom proclamation work.</p>

If Jehovah were to allow that to happen, it would be as if his enemies were more powerful than he is. Moreover, no one would be left on the earth as a foundation for the new world.</p>

The city was compact and therefore easy to defend. Moreover, the physical proximity of homes made it possible for city dwellers to rely upon one another for assistance and protection. This suggests the spiritual unity of the 12 tribes of Israel when they came together for worship.</p>

By not being haughty at heart and lofty in eyes and by not going after things that were too great for him. Rather than seeking prominence, David usually recognized his limitations and manifested humility. We are wise to imitate his attitude, particularly when reaching out for privileges in the congregation.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you ever felt sad at seeing a child playing war games? Such scenes have become commonplace even among the very young, since violence has invaded the world of entertainment. How would you help a youngster to exchange toys of war for toys of peace? Waltraud, a longtime missionary of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Africa, found a way to help one boy to do just that.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Because of warfare, Waltraud had to leave the country where she was living and move to another country in Africa. There she began to study the Bible with the mother of a five-year-old boy. Whenever she visited the mother, the boy was playing with a small plastic gun, the only toy he had. Waltraud never saw him aim it at any target, but he was always busy opening and closing the gun, as if he were reloading it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Waltraud said to the boy: “Werner, do you know why I live in your country? It is because of war<wbr />—I had to flee mine to escape dangerous men who were shooting at people with guns that look like yours. Do you think such shooting is good?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“No, it isn’t,” Werner replied sadly.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“You are quite right,” said Waltraud. Then she asked: “Do you know why I visit you and your mother every week? It is because Jehovah’s Witnesses want to help others to be at peace, both with God and with their neighbors.” With the approval of Werner’s mother, Waltraud told him: “If you give me your gun, I will throw it away, and I will make sure that you get a toy truck with four wheels.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Werner handed her his toy gun. He had to wait for four weeks, but then his new toy arrived<wbr />—a toy truck made of wood, which he accepted with a big smile.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Do you take time to talk with your children, trying to reach their heart so that they are moved to get rid of toys that mimic weapons of war? If so, you will be teaching them a lesson that will benefit them for a lifetime.</p>

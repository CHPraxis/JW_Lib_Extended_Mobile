<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JESUS rebuked self-righteous religious leaders who became indignant when they observed young boys publicly praising God. Appropriately, Jesus asked them: “Did you never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise’?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:15-40:21:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 21:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Six-year-old Daniel, associated with a Russian-language congregation in Germany, offers proof that young people are still praising Jehovah. With his mother and sister, he attended a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Duisburg. This was the first time that they attended such a large convention. Everything was new: the hotel, the large audience, sitting still for three days, the baptism, not to mention the drama. And Daniel? His conduct was exemplary.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the Monday after the convention, at home once again, Daniel got up early to go to kindergarten. But what was still on his jacket? The badge that identified him as a convention delegate! His mother explained to him: “The convention is over. Today you can remove the badge.” But Daniel said: “I want everyone to see where I was and to know what I learned.” So all day at kindergarten, he proudly wore his badge. When his teacher asked him about it, he described the convention program to her.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By doing so, Daniel was following the example of thousands of boys and girls who over the centuries have publicly given praise to Jehovah.</p>

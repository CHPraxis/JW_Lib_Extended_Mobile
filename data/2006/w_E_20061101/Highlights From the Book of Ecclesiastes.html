<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Ecclesiastes</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“MAN, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation,” observed the patriarch Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:1-18:14:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>) How vital that we do not waste our short life on worthless concerns and endeavors! What pursuits should occupy our time, energy, and resources? Which ones should be avoided? The words of wisdom recorded in the Bible book of Ecclesiastes give sound guidance in this regard. The message they convey “is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart” and can help us live a meaningful life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by a man renowned for his wisdom, King Solomon of ancient Israel, the book of Ecclesiastes contains practical advice on what is truly worthwhile in life and what is valueless. Since Solomon refers to some of the building projects he had undertaken, he must have written Ecclesiastes after their completion and before his deflection from true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:26-16:13:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:26</a>) That places the time of writing before 1000 B.C.E., toward the end of Solomon’s 40-year reign.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS NOT VANITY?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:1:1-21:6:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 1:1–6:12</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Everything is vanity!” says the congregator, who asks: “What profit does a man have in all his hard work at which he works hard under the sun?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:1:2-21:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:2, 3</a>) The expressions “vanity” and “under the sun” appear repeatedly in Ecclesiastes. The Hebrew word for “vanity” literally means “breath” or “vapor” and suggests a lack of substance, permanence, or enduring value. The expression “under the sun” means “on this earth” or “in this world.” Hence, everything<wbr />—that is, all human strivings that ignore God’s will—<wbr />is vanity.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the true God,” says Solomon, “and let there be a drawing near to hear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:1-21:5:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>) Engaging in the true worship of Jehovah God is not vanity. In fact, giving attention to our relationship with him is the key to living a meaningful life.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:1:4-21:1:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1:4-10</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—What is there about the natural cycles that is “wearisome”? </strong>The congregator mentions only three of the basic operations that make life on earth possible<wbr />—the sun, the wind pattern, and the water cycle. In reality, the natural cycles are many, and they are very complex. One can spend a lifetime studying them and still not fully understand them. That can indeed be “wearisome.” It is also frustrating to compare our short life span with the unending repetition of these cycles. Even attempts to make new discoveries are wearisome. After all, new inventions are nothing more than applications of principles that the true God has established and has already used in creation.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:1-21:2:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2:1, 2</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Why is laughter spoken of as “insanity”? </strong>Laughter may help us to forget our troubles momentarily, and merrymaking can cause us to view our problems lightly. However, laughter does not make our difficulties disappear. Hence, the pursuit of happiness through laughter is spoken of as “insanity.”</p>

However, there is something else that Jehovah will make “pretty” in the near future. We can be confident that the righteous new world will become a reality at its right time.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:15-21:3:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>3:15b</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How does ‘the true God keep seeking what is pursued’? </strong>‘What is pursued’ may refer to what God purposes to do. While the repetitive cycles of birth and death and of war and peace may make man feel powerless and cause him to think that history keeps repeating itself, the true God can seek and accomplish all that He wants to. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:1-21:3:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:15-21:3:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15a</a>) ‘What is pursued’ may also apply to the righteous, who are often pursued by the wicked. In this case, Jehovah keeps seeking righteous ones in order “to show his strength” in their behalf.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>.</p>

A king is no exception. To receive the produce of his field, the king has to be served by the hard work of his servants who cultivate the land.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:4-21:2:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>2:4-11</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Cultural activities, such as architecture, gardening, and music, as well as luxurious living are “a striving after wind” because they neither make life truly meaningful nor bring lasting happiness.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:12-21:2:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>2:12-16</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Wisdom has the advantage over folly in that it can help solve certain problems. Concerning death, however, human wisdom has no advantage. And even if one may have gained fame because of having such wisdom, one is soon forgotten.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>2:24;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:12-21:3:13" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> <strong>3:12, 13,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:22-21:3:22" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> <strong>22</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Enjoying the fruits of our labor is not wrong.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:2:26-21:2:26" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>2:26</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Godly wisdom, which brings joy, is given to ‘a man who is good before Jehovah.’ It is impossible to gain this wisdom without having a good relationship with God.</p>

Working hard simply to outshine others, however, promotes competition and can breed feelings of ill will and jealousy. Our hard work in the Christian ministry must stem from right motives.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:4:7-21:4:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>4:7-12</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Human relationships are more important than material possessions and should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of riches.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:2-21:5:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>5:2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Our prayers should be thoughtful and reverential, not wordy.</p>

It can also put one in a restless, dreamy state of mind at night, depriving one of sweet sleep. An abundance of words can make a person appear foolish to others <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>and can cause him to make a rash vow before God. ‘Fearing the true God’ prevents us from doing either of these things.</p>

And “better is the seeing by the eyes,” or facing realities, than “the walking about of the soul [“soulful desire,” footnote],” that is, striving to gratify desires that are impossible to satisfy. The best way to live, then, is to be content with “having sustenance and covering” while enjoying wholesome things in life and focusing on maintaining a close relationship with Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">How can we safeguard our good name, or reputation? What should be our attitude toward human rulers and injustices that we may witness? Since the dead are conscious of nothing, how should we use our life now? In what way can youths use their time and energy wisely?

If it moves an individual to pursue a wrong course, though, his heart is said to be at his left hand.</p>

Moreover, no one can restrain the life force from departing at death, nor can anyone be discharged from the war that death wages against mankind. Hence, we should not idly waste time. Jehovah wants us to value life and enjoy it in a wholesome way. To do this, we should give Jehovah’s service the first place in our life.</p>

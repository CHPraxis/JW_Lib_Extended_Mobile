<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 1. What current attitude is not shared by Jehovah’s servants?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">THE world in general pays less and less attention to sacred things. French sociologist Edgar Morin stated: “All the foundations upon which morals are based<wbr />—God, nature, homeland, history, reason—<wbr />have lost their unquestionable nature. . . . People pick and choose their values.” This reflects “the spirit of the world,” or “the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:2</a>) That irreverent spirit is not shared by those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah and who willingly submit to his rightful sovereignty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2</a>) Rather, God’s servants realize the vital place that sacredness, or holiness, has in their worship of Jehovah. What things in our life should be sacred? This article will consider five things that are holy to all of God’s servants. The next article will focus on the sacredness of our Christian meetings. But what does the word “holy” really mean?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">2, 3. (a) How do the Scriptures highlight Jehovah’s holiness? (b) How do we hold Jehovah’s name as something holy?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In Biblical Hebrew, the word “holy” conveys the thought of separateness. In worship, “holy” applies to that which is separated from common use, or held sacred. Jehovah is holy in the absolute sense. He is called “the Most Holy One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:30:3-20:30:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30:3</a>) In ancient Israel, the high priest wore fastened to his turban a gold plate engraved with the words “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:28:36-2:28:37" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 28:36, 37</a>) Heavenly cherubs and seraphs stationed about Jehovah’s throne are depicted in the Scriptures as proclaiming: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:2-23:6:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:6-66:4:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:6-8</a>) This repetition emphasizes that Jehovah is holy, clean, and pure to the superlative degree. He is, in fact, the Source of all holiness.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah’s name is sacred, or holy. The psalmist exclaimed: “Let them laud your name. Great and fear-inspiring, holy it is.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:99:3-19:99:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 99:3</a>) Jesus taught us to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified [or, “be held sacred; be treated as holy,” footnote].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Jesus’ earthly mother, Mary, proclaimed: “My soul magnifies Jehovah . . . the powerful One has done great deeds for me, and holy is his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:46-42:1:46" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 1:46,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:49-42:1:49" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 49</a>) As servants of Jehovah, we hold his name as something holy and avoid doing anything that might bring reproach upon that holy name. Furthermore, we share Jehovah’s view of sacredness, that is, we consider sacred the things that he holds sacred.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:5:14-30:5:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Amos 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 4. Why does the Bible describe Jesus as “the Holy One”?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As the “only-begotten son” of the holy God, Jehovah, Jesus was created holy.

An angel had told her: “Holy spirit will come upon you . . . what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>) In prayer to Jehovah, Christians in Jerusalem twice referred to God’s Son as “your holy servant Jesus.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:27-44:4:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 4:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:30-44:4:30" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus had a sacred mission to fulfill while on earth. At his baptism in 29 C.E., Jesus was anointed as High Priest of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 3:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Hebrews 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:8:1-58:8:2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 8:1, 2</a>) In addition, he was to die a sacrificial death.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Showing that we hold our King and High Priest, Christ Jesus, in deep respect, the apostle Paul wrote: “God exalted [his Son] to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Philippians 2:9-11</a>) We demonstrate that we share Jehovah’s view of sacred things by joyfully submitting ourselves to our Leader and reigning King, Christ Jesus, the Head of the Christian congregation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 23:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:18-51:1:18" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Submission to Christ also involves our showing proper respect for the men used by him to take the lead in the work he is now directing. The role of the spirit-anointed ones who make up the Governing Body and of the overseers appointed by them in the branches, districts, circuits, and congregations should be recognized as a sacred responsibility. This arrangement therefore commands our deep respect and submission.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">8, 9. (a) In what way were the Israelites a holy people? (b) How did Jehovah impress on the Israelites the principle of sacredness?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah made a covenant with Israel. This relationship conferred upon that new nation a special status. They were sanctified, or set apart. Jehovah himself told them: “You must prove yourselves holy to me, because I Jehovah am holy; and I am proceeding to divide you off from the peoples to become mine.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:2-3:19:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:20:26-3:20:26" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 20:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>At the very founding of the nation of Israel, Jehovah impressed upon the Israelites the principle of sacredness. Under pain of death, they were not even to touch the mountain where the Ten Commandments <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>were given. Mount Sinai was then in a sense considered sacred. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:19:12-2:19:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Exodus 19:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:19:23-2:19:23" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 23</a>) The priesthood, the tabernacle, and its furnishings were also to be held sacred.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10, 11. Why can it be said that the Christian congregation of anointed ones is sacred, and what effect does this have on the “other sheep”?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Christian congregation of anointed ones is sacred in Jehovah’s eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:2-46:1:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>) In fact, the entire group of anointed Christians on earth at any one time is likened to a holy temple, although they do not constitute Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. Jehovah inhabits that temple by means of his holy spirit. The apostle Paul wrote: “In union with [Christ Jesus] the whole building, being harmoniously joined together, is growing into a holy temple for Jehovah. In union with him you, too, are being built up together into a place for God to inhabit by spirit.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:21-49:2:22" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:5-60:2:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Not surprisingly, many things related to the lives of anointed members of the Christian congregation and their companions are held sacred. <em>Our relationship with Jehovah </em>is something sacred. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:7-19:36:7" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Psalm 36:7</a>) It is so precious to us that we allow nothing and no one to come between us and our God, Jehovah.

Prayer was so sacred to the prophet Daniel that even at the risk of his life, he <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>continued faithful in his custom of praying to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:7-27:6:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Daniel 6:7-11</a>) “The prayers of the holy ones,” or anointed Christians, are likened to incense used in temple worship.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13. What force is holy, and how should we allow it to operate in our lives?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>There is a force in the lives of anointed Christians and their companions that they by all means hold sacred<wbr />—<em>holy spirit. </em>That spirit is Jehovah’s active force, and since it always acts in harmony with the will of the holy God, it is properly called “holy spirit,” or “the spirit of holiness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:4-45:1:4" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Romans 1:4</a>) By means of holy spirit, Jehovah provides his servants the power to preach the good news.

They too must prove that they share Jehovah’s view of sacred things. In the book of Revelation, they are represented as rendering Jehovah “sacred service” in the earthly courtyard of his spiritual temple. They have put faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice, symbolically ‘washing their robes and making them white in the blood of the Lamb.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:15" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>) This gives them a clean standing before Jehovah and places them under obligation to “cleanse [themselves] of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.”</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>An important feature in the lives of anointed Christians and their companions is that of regularly meeting to worship Jehovah and study his Word. Jehovah considers gatherings of his people as something sacred. How and why we should share Jehovah’s view of sacred things in this vital area will be considered in the following article.</p>

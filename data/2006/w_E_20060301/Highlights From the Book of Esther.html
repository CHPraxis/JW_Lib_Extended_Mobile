<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Esther</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE plan simply cannot fail. The massacre of the Jews will be thorough and efficient. On a single predetermined day, all the Jews living in the empire, which stretches from India to Ethiopia, will be annihilated. That is what the planner of the scheme thinks. One vital detail, though, has escaped his attention. The God of the heavens can deliver his chosen people out of any desperate situation. The deliverance is recorded in the Bible book of Esther.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by an elderly Jewish man named Mordecai, the book of Esther covers a period of some 18 years during the reign of the Persian King Ahasuerus, or Xerxes I. This dramatic narrative shows how Jehovah saves his people from the evil designs of their enemies, even though his servants are widely dispersed throughout a vast empire. Today, that knowledge is indeed faith-strengthening to Jehovah’s people, who are rendering sacred service to him in 235 lands. Moreover, the characters portrayed in the book of Esther provide examples for us to imitate and others that we want to avoid. Indeed, “the word of God is alive and exerts power.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:1:1-17:5:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Esther 1:1–5:14</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In his third regnal year (493 B.C.E.), King Ahasuerus holds a royal banquet. Queen Vashti, renowned for her loveliness, incurs the king’s great displeasure and is deprived of her rank. The Jewess Hadassah is selected from all the beautiful virgins of the land to take her place. At her cousin Mordecai’s direction, she conceals her Jewish identity and uses her Persian name, Esther.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In time, a haughty man named Haman is exalted to the position of prime minister. Haman is enraged at Mordecai’s refusal to ‘bow low or prostrate himself to Haman,’ so he schemes to annihilate all the Jews in the Persian Empire. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:3:2-17:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 3:2</a>) Haman persuades Ahasuerus to agree with him and succeeds in getting the king to issue a decree to accomplish this massacre. Mordecai is in “sackcloth and ashes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:4:1-17:4:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 4:1</a>) Esther must now intervene. She invites the king and his prime minister to a private banquet. When they gladly attend, Esther petitions them to come for another banquet the next day. Haman is joyful. However, he is infuriated by Mordecai’s refusal to honor him. Haman lays out a plan to kill Mordecai before the banquet the next day.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:1:3-17:1:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1:3-5</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Did the banquet last for 180 days? </strong>The text does not state that the banquet lasted that long but that the king showed the officials the riches and the beauty of his glorious <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>kingdom for 180 days. Perhaps the king used this lengthy event to show off the glory of his kingdom in order to impress the nobles and convince them of his ability to carry out his plans. In that case, verses 3 and 5 could refer to the 7-day banquet that took place at the end of the 180-day gathering.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:1:8-17:1:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1:8</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—In what way was there ‘no one compelling as regards the time of drinking according to the law’? </strong>On this occasion, King Ahasuerus made an exception to what appears to have been a Persian custom of urging one another to drink a certain amount at such gatherings. “They could drink as much or as little as they desired,” says one reference work.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:1:10-17:1:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1:10-12</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Why did Queen Vashti keep refusing to come to the king? </strong>Some scholars suggest that the queen refused to obey because she chose not to degrade herself before the king’s drunken guests. Or perhaps this outwardly beautiful queen really was not submissive. While the Bible does not state her motive, the wise men of the day thought that obedience to the husband was definitely an issue and that Vashti’s bad example would influence all the wives in the provinces of Persia.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:2:14-17:2:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2:14-17</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Did Esther have immoral sexual relations with the king? </strong>The answer is no. The account says that in the morning the other women brought to the king were returned to the second house under the charge of the king’s eunuch, “the guardian of the concubines.” The women who spent the night with the king thus became his concubines, or secondary wives. However, Esther was not taken to the house of concubines after seeing the king. When Esther was brought before Ahasuerus, “the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:2:17-17:2:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 2:17</a>) How did she gain Ahasuerus’ “favor and loving-kindness”? The same way she had won the favor of others. “The young woman was pleasing in [Hegai’s] eyes, so that she gained loving-kindness before him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:2:8-17:2:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9</a>) Hegai favored her strictly on the basis of what he observed<wbr />—her appearance and good qualities. In fact, “Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 2:15</a>) Similarly, the king was impressed with what he saw in Esther and therefore came to love her.</p>

However, in the case of Haman, more was involved. Haman was an Agagite, probably an Amalekite, and Jehovah had marked Amalek for extermination. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:25:19-5:25:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 25:19</a>) For Mordecai, bowing down to Haman was an issue of integrity to Jehovah. He flatly refused, stating that he was a Jew.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/17:3:3-17:3:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Esther 3:3, 4</a>.</p>

The 10,000 silver pieces that Haman had promised were far less profitable to the king’s treasury than the wealth that could have been generated if Haman had schemed to sell the Jews as slaves. The execution of the plot would also have meant the loss of the queen.</p>

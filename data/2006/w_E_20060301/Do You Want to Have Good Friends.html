<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MOST people want to have good friends. Being able to share your experiences with close companions enriches your life. But how can you find genuine friendship? Nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus showed that the key to success in all human relations is unselfish love. He taught: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>) This statement, often called the Golden Rule, shows that you need to be an unselfish, giving person to have friends. Simply put, to have a friend, you need to be one. How?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A close, warm friendship cannot be cultivated overnight. After all, friends are much more than acquaintances. They are individuals to whom you attach yourself emotionally. Developing and maintaining close bonds takes effort. Friendship often requires that you put your companion’s needs ahead of your own convenience. Friends share not only their joys but also their disappointments.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You show true friendship especially by giving emotional and practical support to a person in need. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a> states: “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” In fact, bonds of friendship may be even stronger than certain family ties. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:24-20:18:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:24</a> notes: “There exist companions disposed to break one another to pieces, but there exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.” Would you like to know more about how to cultivate such meaningful friendships? Would you like to become part of a group of people who are known for having love among themselves? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) If so, Jehovah’s Witnesses in your community will be glad to show you how to find true friends.</p>

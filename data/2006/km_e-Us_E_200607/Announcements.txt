Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July and August: What Does the Bible Really Teach? When householders already have this publication, use an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. Follow up all placements by making return visits with the objective of starting Bible studies. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Keep on the Watch! brochure and seek to cultivate further interest in the Bible.
▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “What Is Your Standing With God?”
▪ Beginning the week of January 8, 2007, we will study Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! at the Congregation Book Study. A large-print edition of the book is being prepared. Congregations should have on hand appropriate supplies of the regular and large-print editions in time for the study.
▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31, 2006, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the Literature Inventory (S-18) form. The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms. Please mail the original to the branch office no later than September 6. Keep a copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet.
▪ On September 1 and 2, 2006, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Wallkill Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.
▪ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, a new form should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer approved as a volunteer worker, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter. The completed forms in the congregation file should be made available for the circuit overseer’s review when he visits the congregation.
▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in Awake! of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.

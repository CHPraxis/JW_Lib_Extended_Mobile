Imitate Our “Happy God,” Jehovah
1 Jehovah truly wants people to be happy. His Word fills us with anticipation for the marvelous blessings he has in store for mankind. (Isa. 65:21-25) It should be evident to others that we find joy in sharing “the glorious good news of the happy God” with them. (1 Tim. 1:11) The way in which we speak about the Kingdom message should reflect our love for the truth and our genuine interest in the people to whom we speak.​—Rom. 1:14-16.
2 Admittedly, at times it can be a challenge to maintain a cheerful attitude. In some territories, we find few people who respond favorably to the Kingdom message. There may be days when we are dealing with difficult circumstances in our own life. To maintain a joyful spirit, we do well to reflect on just how much the people in our territory need to hear and get the sense of the Kingdom good news we are preaching. (Rom. 10:13, 14, 17) Meditating on this will help us to continue joyfully making known Jehovah’s merciful provisions for salvation.
3 Focus on the Positive: We also need to give attention to what we say. Although we may begin a discussion by mentioning a problem or a news item that is on people’s minds, we should avoid needlessly dwelling on negative things. Our commission is to bring “good news of something better.” (Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:15) This good news is a message based on God’s promises of a brighter future. (2 Pet. 3:13) With this in mind, use the Scriptures to “bind up the brokenhearted.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) This will help each of us to maintain a cheerful spirit and a positive manner.
4 People will without fail notice our cheerful attitude as we share in the preaching work. So, then, let us always reflect the disposition of our “happy God,” Jehovah, as we share the Kingdom good news with the people in our territory.

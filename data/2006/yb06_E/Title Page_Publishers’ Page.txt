2006 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 2005
“We Must Obey God as Ruler Rather Than Men.”​—Acts 5:29.
Shortly before his death, Jesus warned his apostles that they would be “objects of hatred by all the nations.” (Matt. 24:9) Ever since the very birth of Christianity, those words have proved true. Countless governments have tried to silence the proclamation of the good news, but they have failed because Jehovah blesses and guards his loyal ones. (Ps. 97:10) How fitting it is, therefore, to keep close in mind our yeartext for 2006! In the pages that follow, you will learn that Jehovah’s Witnesses obey God as Ruler despite many forms of human opposition. May you be encouraged and strengthened to follow their example always.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">1, 2. What mighty acts did Jehovah perform in behalf of his people, and what relationship did the Israelites enter into with God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">IN 1513 B.C.E., Jehovah brought his servants on earth into a new relationship with him. That year, he humiliated a world power and delivered the Israelites from slavery. In so doing, he became their Savior and Owner. Before acting, God told Moses: “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘I am Jehovah, and I shall certainly bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver you from their slavery, and I shall indeed reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. And I shall certainly take you as my people, and I shall indeed prove to be your God.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:6:6-2:6:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 6:6, 7</a>, footnotes; 15:1-7, 11.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Shortly after their Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites entered into a covenant relationship with their God, Jehovah. Rather than dealing with individuals, families, or clans, henceforth Jehovah would have an organized people, a nation, on earth.

Moses said to them: “What great nation is there that has gods near to it the way Jehovah our God is in all our calling upon him? And what great nation is there that has righteous regulations and judicial decisions like all this law that I am putting before you today?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:4:7-5:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">3, 4. What was an important reason for Israel’s existence as a nation?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Centuries later, Jehovah reminded the Israelites, through his prophet Isaiah, of an important reason for their existence as a nation. Isaiah said: “This is what Jehovah has said, your Creator, O Jacob, and your Former, O Israel: ‘Do not be afraid, for I have repurchased you. I have called you by your name. You are mine. For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel your Savior. . . . Bring my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremity of the earth, everyone that is called by my name and that I have created for my own glory, that I have formed, yes, that I have made. You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘even my servant whom I have chosen, . . . the people whom I have formed for myself, that <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>they should recount the praise of me.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:1-23:43:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:3-23:43:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:6-23:43:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:21-23:43:21" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As a people called by Jehovah’s name, the Israelites would serve as witnesses to his sovereignty before the nations. They were to be a people ‘created for Jehovah’s glory.’ They were to ‘recount the praise of Jehovah,’ relate his wondrous acts of deliverance and thus glorify his holy name. In short, they were to be a nation of witnesses for Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5. In what respects was Israel a dedicated nation?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In the 11th century B.C.E., King Solomon indicated that Jehovah had made Israel a separated nation. In prayer to Jehovah, he stated: “You yourself separated them as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:8:53-11:8:53" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:53</a>) Individual Israelites also had a special relationship with Jehovah. Earlier, Moses had told them: “Sons you are of Jehovah your God. . . . For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:14:1-5:14:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:1, 2</a>) Young Israelites, therefore, did not need to dedicate their lives to Jehovah. They were born as members of God’s dedicated people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:79:13-19:79:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 79:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:95:7-19:95:7" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 95:7</a>) Each new generation was instructed in the laws of Jehovah and was obligated to keep them by virtue of the covenant that bound Israel to Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:11:18-5:11:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 11:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Free to Choose</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6. What choice did individual Israelites have to make?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Although the Israelites were born into a dedicated nation, each individual had to make a personal decision to serve God. Before they entered the Promised Land, Moses told them: “I do take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today, that I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the malediction; and you must choose life in order that you may keep alive, you and your offspring, by loving Jehovah your God, by listening to his voice and by sticking to him; for he is your life and the length of your days, that you may dwell upon the ground that Jehovah swore to your forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19, 20</a>) Hence, the Israelites individually had to choose to love Jehovah, to listen to his voice, and to stick to him. Since the Israelites had free will, they would have to bear the consequences of their choice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:30:16-5:30:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:16-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. What happened after the death of Joshua’s generation?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The period of the Judges provides a good illustration of the consequences of faithfulness and of unfaithfulness. Just before that period began, the Israelites followed the good example of Joshua and were blessed. “The people continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the older men who extended their days after Joshua and who had seen all of Jehovah’s great work that he did for Israel.” However, some time after Joshua’s death, “another generation began to rise after them that did not know Jehovah or the work that he had done for Israel. And the sons of Israel fell to doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:2:7-7:2:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Judges 2:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:2:10-7:2:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) Apparently, the upcoming, inexperienced generation did not prize their heritage as members of a dedicated people, in whose behalf their God, Jehovah, had accomplished mighty acts in the past.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:78:3-19:78:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 78:3-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:78:10-19:78:11" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Living Up to Their Dedication</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">8, 9. (a) What arrangement allowed the Israelites to demonstrate their dedication to Jehovah? (b) What did those who made voluntary offerings gain for themselves?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jehovah provided his people with opportunities to live up to the national dedication. For instance, his Law provided for a system of sacrifices, or offerings, some of which were compulsory, while others were voluntary. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:8:3-58:8:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 8:3</a>) Such sacrifices included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and communion offerings that were voluntary<wbr />—gifts presented to Jehovah to gain his favor and express thanksgiving.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:7:11-3:7:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Leviticus 7:11-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Those voluntary sacrifices pleased Jehovah. It was said of the burnt offering and of the grain offering that they were “a restful odor to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:9-3:1:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:2:2-3:2:2" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:2</a>) In the communion sacrifice, the blood and the fat of the animal were offered to Jehovah, while portions of the meat were consumed by the priests and the offerer. It was thus a symbolic meal signifying a peaceful relationship with Jehovah. The Law stated: “Now in case you should sacrifice a communion sacrifice to Jehovah, you should sacrifice it to gain approval for yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:5-3:19:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:5</a>) While all Israelites were dedicated to Jehovah by reason of birth, those who made their dedication meaningful by making voluntary offerings ‘gained approval for themselves’ and were richly blessed.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Malachi 3:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10. How did Jehovah express his displeasure in the days of Isaiah and of Malachi?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Frequently, however, the dedicated nation of Israel proved unfaithful to Jehovah. Through his prophet Isaiah, Jehovah said to them: “You have not brought me the sheep of your whole burnt offerings, and with your sacrifices you have not glorified me. I have not compelled you to serve me with a gift.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:23-23:43:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:23</a>) In addition, offerings that were not made willingly and out of love had no value in Jehovah’s eyes. For instance, three centuries after Isaiah, in the days of the prophet Malachi, the Israelites offered blemished animals. Hence, Malachi told them: “‘No delight do I have in you,’ Jehovah of armies has said, ‘and in the gift offering from your hand I take no pleasure.’ . . . ‘You have brought something torn away, and the lame one, and the sick one; yes, you have brought it as a gift. Can I take pleasure in it at your hand?’ Jehovah has said.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:1:10-39:1:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Malachi 1:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:1:13-39:1:13" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:5:22-30:5:22" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Amos 5:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>At the time the Israelites became a nation dedicated to Jehovah, he promised them: “If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>A few days before his death, Jesus told the Jewish religious leaders: “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes’? This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:42-40:21:43" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 21:42, 43</a>) Showing that Jehovah had rejected them as a nation dedicated to Him, Jesus stated: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her,<wbr />—how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings! But you people did not want it. Look! Your house is abandoned to you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:37-40:23:38" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 23:37, 38</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>At the time of the prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah foretold something new with regard to his people. We read: “‘Look!

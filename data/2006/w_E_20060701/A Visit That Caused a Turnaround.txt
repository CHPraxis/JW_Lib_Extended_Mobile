A Visit That Caused a Turnaround
“I COULDN’T wait to tell my family about the two ‘angels’ God sent to me.” So wrote a gentleman who was visited by two young women who are Jehovah’s Witnesses. A few weeks before their visit, he had lost in death his wife of 45 years. He was devastated. His adult children had provided him comfort, but they lived far away. No friends and neighbors had come to visit him.
“God and I are not on speaking terms,” said the man to the young women when they visited him. However, they were sympathetic and left with him a small Bible-based tract entitled What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? He read it that evening and found solace.
A short time later, the two Christian women returned. They had recalled how sad he had been on the previous visit and came to see how he was doing. “I was stunned,” the man later wrote, “that two total strangers cared about me and were concerned about my well-being.” He was encouraged by the thoughts they shared with him from the Bible. The women said that they would call again. The gentleman was delighted and was moved to write the above-mentioned comments in a letter that he sent to the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Before moving to a location nearer to one of his children, this man attended a Christian meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses and had a meal with the family of one of the young women. He wrote: “I am leaving the area, but those young people and your church will always have a place in my heart and in my prayers. Yes, I do pray now—a lot. I have made a complete turnaround. Those young folks played a major part in that, and I will be forever grateful to them.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year a young mother wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico and requested help in achieving a happy family life. She explained that she had enjoyed reading <em>Awake! </em>magazine and said:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have been married for three years, and I would like to get advice and suggestions on building a good family. My husband and I had a beautiful boy two years ago, and I would also like to bring him up well.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This mother had heard about the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>and wrote to request a copy. Thousands of others have done the same. After reading it many have reported how helpful it has been. Among the book’s instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”</p>

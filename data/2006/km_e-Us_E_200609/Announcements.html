<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>September: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. Follow up all placements by making return visits with the objective of starting Bible studies. <strong>October 1-15: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Keep on the Watch! </em>brochure and seek to cultivate further interest in the Bible. <strong>October 16–November 12: </strong>Special campaign distribution of <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 37, “The End of False Religion Is Near!” <strong>November 13-30: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher</em>. If individuals say they have no children, offer the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible−God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</em>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 2006 and the <em>Watchtower Library​—2006 Edition </em>on CD-ROM with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please note that <em>Watchtower Library​—2006 Edition </em>is a provision for baptized members of the congregation and is made available only through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a> regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The September <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert, pages 3-6, lists a number of adjustments for each one to make in his personal copy of the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book. This should be done in preparation for the Congregation Book Study starting the week of January 8, 2007.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The <em>Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet </em>(TO-33) and <em>Safety Inspection Work Sheet </em>(TO-34) are to be completed each September. Copies of the completed forms should promptly be provided to the body of elders for each congregation meeting in the Kingdom Hall and to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.</p>

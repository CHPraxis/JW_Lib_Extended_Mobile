<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Let the Will of Jehovah Take Place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:14-44:21:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 21:14</a>) This was the title of a symposium presented to the United States Bethel family by Governing Body and Branch Committee members on the evening of Monday, December 26, 2005. It was explained that as a result of the simplification of certain branch operations, some Bethel family members would be invited to serve in the United States field in various assignments where the excellent training they have received at Bethel could be put to good use.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Improved technology has made our shipping and printing facilities more efficient. This has reduced the need for volunteers in the Bethel home. On the other hand, there is a growing need for more “workers [in the] harvest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:2-42:10:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 10:2</a>) As one member of the Governing Body observed: “We can buy machines to do our printing for us, but machines cannot preach the good news.” Therefore, mature, experienced brothers and sisters who have benefited from Bethel training are being assigned to the field where they will be able to contribute much to the preaching and disciple-making work. A number of congregations in the United States branch territory will benefit from their help.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We are confident that Jehovah will richly bless the adjustments being made to balance the need for faithful workers at Bethel with the needs in the field.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">United States Branch Office</p>

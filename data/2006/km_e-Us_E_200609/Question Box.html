<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Is it appropriate to compile material that will be featured in the Theocratic Ministry School and distribute it to others?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is permissible to do this for the personal use of family members and a few close friends. However, such material should not be made available for general distribution or be provided in exchange for money, as this would be a violation of copyright laws.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For certain assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School, only a theme is provided; no references are indicated as source material. Would it be beneficial for someone to work up a list of references or to compile source material that could be used by those who receive such assignments? No. Neither would it be proper to compile the answers to the questions in the Theocratic Ministry School Review for use by others, as this would not help them to fix important points in mind. Students should do their own research. This is an important aspect of the training that Jehovah provides by means of the school to help us speak with “the tongue of the taught ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:4-23:50:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 50:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Is that how you felt after you first watched the video <em>Young People Ask​—How Can I Make Real Friends? </em>Some years ago, a young brother was going through a difficult time in his life, all because of the friends he had chosen. They caused him to lose interest in the truth, and he lost his relationship with Jehovah. Then the <em>Real Friends </em>video was released. He wrote: “As I watched the video over and over again, tears rolled down my face. I thanked Jehovah for the help at the proper time.” The video motivated him to turn his life around and to acquire the right kind of friends. He added: “It is obvious that you are up-to-date with what is affecting young ones.” Parents and youths, why not watch the video again at your next family study? Pause it after each part, and discuss together openly and honestly the questions in the following paragraphs.</p>

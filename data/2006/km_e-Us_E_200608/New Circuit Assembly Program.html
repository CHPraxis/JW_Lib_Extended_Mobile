<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The world would have us believe that the present system of things will last forever. However, God’s Word tells us differently. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) It helps us to appreciate that ‘storing up treasures upon the earth’ is a vain pursuit. To fortify God’s people, the circuit assembly program for the 2007 service year will develop the theme “Store Up . . . Treasures in Heaven.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Materialistic thinking is included in what is referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2</a> as “the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.” Just as the literal air is everywhere, ready to be breathed in, so “the spirit of the world” permeates this system. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:12-46:2:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:12</a>) Since its influence is very potent, it is said to have “authority.” The new circuit assembly program will help us to avoid the world’s materialistic thinking and to keep sharply in focus our priorities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) In addition, the program will help us to rely on Jehovah as we carry out our ministry despite the pressures and trials we may face.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Make sure that you are present for both days and that you “pay more than the usual attention.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:1-58:2:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 2:1</a>) Take brief notes on points that you can apply personally in your life and in your ministry. By being present from the very beginning to the very end of this spiritually enriching program, you will be encouraged and strengthened to continue ‘storing up treasures in heaven’!</p>

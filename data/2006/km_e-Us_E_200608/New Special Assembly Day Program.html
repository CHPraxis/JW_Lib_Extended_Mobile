<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Empowered by holy spirit, the early Christians exercised the greatest vigor in giving the good news the widest possible proclamation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Col. 1:23</a>) The special assembly day program for the 2007 service year, “Be Intensely Occupied With the Word,” will help us to imitate their excellent example.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:5-44:18:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 18:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Commenting on God’s word, King David said: “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7</a>) The carefully prepared program for the 2007 special assembly day will highlight the value of the Scriptures “for setting things straight” and will encourage us to use God’s Word to preach and to teach with a sense of urgency. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) The new program will show how we can avoid pitfalls and benefit ourselves by applying Bible principles in daily life. It will also help us to use God’s Word to assist youths and new ones to make spiritual progress.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Make sure to be present when the program begins, and pay close attention. Take notes on points that you can apply personally. Show your appreciation for the instruction and reminders received, and reflect on how you intend to put into practice the things learned.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The special assembly day program will increase our appreciation of God’s Word, remind us to continue steadfast in preaching the Kingdom good news with zeal, and show us how to help others to do likewise. So be resolved not to miss out on any of the spiritual direction and instruction Jehovah provides in this way!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:20-23:30:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 30:20b, 21</a>.</p>

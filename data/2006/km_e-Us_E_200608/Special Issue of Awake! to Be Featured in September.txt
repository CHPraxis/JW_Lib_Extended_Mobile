Special Issue of Awake! to Be Featured in September
1 Almost everyone appreciates the sound of songbirds and the sight of a sunset. Many, however, fail to acknowledge that a loving heavenly Father created these things. We will have a unique opportunity to testify in behalf of Jehovah’s creatorship by distributing a special issue of Awake! (Isa. 40:28; 43:10) The September issue is devoted entirely to the subject “Is There a Creator?”
2 In the Territory: If possible, arrange to share in the house-to-house ministry with the congregation each Saturday. Of course, feel free to offer the special issue at other times during the week. Teachers and others who work in the field of education should be particularly interested in this issue. Therefore, special arrangements may be made to visit such ones who are in your territory.
3 If interest is shown, leave the person with a question that you will answer on the next visit. For example, you could raise a question about why a loving Creator would allow so much suffering. Then, on the return visit, you could feature chapter 1 or chapter 11 of the Bible Teach book. Or you may choose to raise a question about the Creator’s purpose for the earth and then to consider chapter 3 when you return.
4 At School: If you are in school, why not present the special Awake! as a gift to your teachers and fellow students? Just putting a copy on your desk may prompt questions about our beliefs. You will likely have opportunities to use information from it when defending your faith in classroom discussions and when preparing reports. To assist you, this issue contains a “Young People Ask” article entitled “How Can I Defend My Belief in Creation?”
5 Jehovah deserves honor and glory for what he has created. (Rev. 4:11) We can honor our Creator and help others to do so by enthusiastically offering the September issue of Awake!

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for August: What Does the Bible Really Teach? When householders already have this publication, use an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. Follow up all placements by making return visits with the objective of starting Bible studies. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Keep on the Watch! brochure and seek to cultivate further interest in the Bible. November: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2007 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2007, and the 2007 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the monthly “Announcement to All Congregations.”

Follow up all placements by making return visits with the objective of starting Bible studies. <strong>October</strong>: The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Keep on the Watch! </em>brochure and seek to cultivate further interest in the Bible. <strong>November</strong>: <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</em></p>

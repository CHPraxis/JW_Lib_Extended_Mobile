<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SLADJANA, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Croatia, was scheduled to appear in court concerning some financial matters. She presented herself on time before a judge. However, another party in the case was late. Sladjana was eager to give a witness, so while everyone was waiting, she mustered up the courage to speak to the judge.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Sir, did you know that soon there will be no judges and no courts on earth?” she asked. She was referring, of course, to judges as we know them today.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Surprised, the judge simply looked at her, without saying a word. Just then the proceedings began. When they ended and Sladjana stood up to sign a document, the judge leaned over and asked her in a whisper: “Are you sure of what you just told me, that soon there will be no judges and no courts on earth?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Yes, Sir. I am absolutely sure!” replied Sladjana.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“What evidence do you have for that?” the judge asked.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“It can be found in the Bible,” Sladjana answered.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The judge said that he would like to read such evidence, but he did not have a Bible. So Sladjana offered to get him one. The Witnesses called on the judge, gave him a Bible, and encouraged him to have a weekly Bible study. The judge accepted the offer and soon became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Prophetically, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:2:10-19:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 2:10</a> says: “Now, O kings, exercise insight; let yourselves be corrected, O judges of the earth.” How heartwarming when such ones humbly accept Jehovah’s loving direction!</p>

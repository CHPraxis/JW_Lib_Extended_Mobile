<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Isaiah<wbr />—I</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“WHOM shall I send, and who will go for us?” To this invitation from Jehovah God, Isaiah the son of Amoz replies: “Here I am! Send me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:1-23:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6:8</a>) At that, he receives an assignment as a prophet. Isaiah’s prophetic activities are recorded in the Bible book bearing his name.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by the prophet himself, the book of Isaiah covers a period of 46 years, from about 778 B.C.E. to sometime after 732 B.C.E. While the book contains pronouncements against Judah, Israel, and surrounding nations, its basic theme is not judgment. Rather, it is ‘the salvation by Jehovah God.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:25:9-23:25:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:9</a>) The very name Isaiah, in fact, means “Salvation of Jehovah.” This article will discuss highlights from <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:1-23:35:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:1–35:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“A MERE REMNANT WILL RETURN”</strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Whether the prophetic message recorded in the first five chapters of the book of Isaiah is delivered before Isaiah’s appointment as a prophet or after, the Bible does not say. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:6-23:6:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:6-9</a>) What is clear, though, is that Judah and Jerusalem are spiritually sick “from the sole of the foot even to the head.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:6-23:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:6</a>) Idolatry is rampant. Leaders are corrupt. Women have become haughty. People do not serve the true God acceptably. Isaiah is commissioned to go and speak “again and again” to those who neither understand nor want any knowledge.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Judah is threatened with invasion by the combined forces of Israel and Syria. Using Isaiah and his children “as signs and as miracles,” Jehovah assures Judah that the Syro-Israelite alliance will not succeed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:8:18-23:8:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:18</a>) Unending peace, though, will come only through the rule of the “Prince of Peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>) Jehovah shall also call to account Assyria, the nation that he uses as “the rod for [his] anger.” Judah will eventually go into captivity, but “a mere remnant will return.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:10:5-23:10:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:10:21-23:10:22" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>) True justice is to become a reality under the rule of a figurative “twig out of the stump of Jesse.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:1-23:11:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:8-23:1:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>1:8, 9</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How is the daughter of Zion to be “left remaining like a booth in a vineyard, like a lookout hut in a field of cucumbers”? </strong>This means that during the Assyrian invasion, Jerusalem will look extremely vulnerable, like a mere booth in a vineyard or an easily collapsible hut in a cucumber field. But Jehovah comes to her aid and thus does not allow her to become like Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

This diabolical scheme would have the effect of interrupting the operation of the Kingdom covenant with David. Jehovah extended salvation to Ahaz in order to preserve the line through which the promised “Prince of Peace” would come.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:15:29-12:15:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Kings 15:29</a>) It continued long thereafter into the days of the Assyrian King Esar-haddon, a son and successor of Sennacherib.

He was a descendant of Jesse through Jesse’s son David.

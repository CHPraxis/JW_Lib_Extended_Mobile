<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From Books Three and Four of Psalms</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN A prayer to God, the psalmist asks: “Will your loving-kindness be declared in the burial place itself, your faithfulness in the place of destruction?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:11-19:88:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 88:11</a>) The answer, of course, is no. Without life, we cannot praise Jehovah. Praising Jehovah is a good reason for us to keep living, and having life is a good reason to praise him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Books Three and Four of Psalms, consisting of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:0-19:106:48" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 73 to 106</a>, give us plenty of reasons for praising the Creator and blessing his name. Reflecting on these psalms ought to deepen our appreciation for “the word of God” and move us to enlarge and improve our expressions of praise to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) With keen interest, let us first turn to Book Three of Psalms.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“THE DRAWING NEAR TO GOD IS GOOD FOR ME”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:1-19:89:52" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 73:1–89:52</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The first 11 psalms of the third collection are compositions by Asaph or by members of the house of Asaph. The opening song explains what has saved Asaph from being led astray by erroneous thinking. He has reached the right conclusion. “As for me,” he sings, “the drawing near to God is good for me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 73:28</a>) A lament over the destruction of Jerusalem follows in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:74:0-19:74:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 74</a>. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:75:0-19:75:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalms 75,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:76:0-19:76:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 76</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:77:0-19:77:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">77</a> portray Jehovah as the righteous Judge, the Savior of the meek, and the Hearer of prayer. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:0-19:78:72" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 78</a> reviews Israel’s past from the time of Moses to that of David. The 79th Psalm laments the destruction of the temple. Next comes a prayer for the restoration of God’s people. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:81:0-19:81:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 81</a> is an exhortation to obey Jehovah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:0-19:82:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalms 82 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:0-19:83:18" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 83</a> are prayers for the execution of divine judgment upon corrupt judges and God’s enemies respectively.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“My soul has yearned and also pined away for the courtyards of Jehovah,” states a melody of the sons of Korah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:2-19:84:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 84:2</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:85:0-19:85:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 85</a> is a request for God’s blessing upon the returnees from exile. This psalm emphasizes that spiritual blessings are far more valuable than physical blessings. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:0-19:86:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 86</a>, David asks God to guard him and instruct him. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:87:0-19:87:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 87</a>, a melody about Zion and those born there is followed by a prayer to Jehovah in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 88</a>. Jehovah’s loving-kindness as expressed in the Davidic covenant is emphasized in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:0-19:89:52" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 89</a>, composed by Ethan, perhaps one of four wise men in the days of Solomon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:31-11:4:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:31</a>.</p>

Hence, the term “horn” figuratively denotes power, or strength. Jehovah raises up the horns of his people, causing them to be exalted, whereas he ‘cuts down the horns of the wicked ones.’ We are warned against ‘exalting our horn on high’ in that we should not take on a proud or arrogant attitude. Since Jehovah does the exalting, assignments of responsibility in the congregation are to be viewed as coming from him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:75:7-19:75:7" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 75:7</a>.</p>

Any hardship we may experience can discipline us in some way. Jehovah permits suffering only to the extent that it provides such training. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a>) ‘The remainder of raging by man, God girds upon himself.’ What if we suffer to the point of death?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:40-19:105:40" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 105:40</a>) Since angels, or “powerful ones,” dwell in heaven, the phrase “the very bread of angels” may simply mean that it was provided by God, who dwells in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 11:4</a>) Jehovah may also have used angels to provide the manna for the Israelites.</p>

The wicked are on slippery ground. They will surely “fall to ruins.” Moreover, since wickedness <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>cannot be removed under imperfect human rule, our putting forth effort to eradicate it would be futile. Like Asaph, we are wise if we cope with wickedness by “drawing near to God” and by taking delight in a close relationship with Him.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:3-19:73:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>73:3,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:6-19:73:6" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> <strong>6,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:8-19:73:8" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> <strong>8,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:27-19:73:27" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> <strong>27</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We must guard against boasting, haughtiness, scoffing, and defrauding.

This reaction is impulsive, based strictly on the senses. Rather, we should be led by Jehovah’s counsel, fully confident that he will ‘hold us by the right hand’ and support us. Additionally, Jehovah ‘will take us to glory,’ that is, into a close relationship with him.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Consider the various reasons for extolling Jehovah that are set out in the fourth collection of psalms. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:0-19:90:17" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 90</a>, Moses contrasts the existence of “the King of eternity” with the fleeting life of man. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17</a>) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:2-19:91:2" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 91:2</a>, Moses refers to Jehovah as ‘his refuge and his stronghold’​—his Source of security. The next few psalms speak of God’s beautiful qualities, superior thoughts, and wonderful works. Three songs open with the expression “Jehovah himself has become king.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:93:1-19:93:1" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 93:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:1-19:97:1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 97:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:99:1-19:99:1" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> 99:1</a>) Speaking of Jehovah as our Maker, the psalmist invites us to “give thanks to him, bless his name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:4-19:100:4" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 100:4</a>.</p>

This indicates that a person who uses idols may come under demon influence. The Bible urges us: “Guard yourselves from idols.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="70-1" class="b">1 John 5:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">The last three songs of Book Four of Psalms close with the admonition: “Praise Jah, you people!” The last psalm also opens with it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:35-19:104:35" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Psalm 104:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:45-19:105:45" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 105:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:1-19:106:1" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> 106:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:48-19:106:48" data-bid="71-4" class="b"> 48</a>) In fact, the expression “Praise Jah, you people!” occurs frequently in Book Four of the psalms.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">We certainly have reason to praise Jehovah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:0-19:106:48" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Psalms 73 through 106</a> have given us much to ponder, filling our hearts with gratitude to our heavenly Father. When we think about all that he has already done for us and will do for us in the future, are we not moved to “praise Jah” with all our might?</p>

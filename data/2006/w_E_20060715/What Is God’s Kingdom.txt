What Is God’s Kingdom?




WHAT a terrible disaster struck mankind early in human history! An angel rebelled against the authority of the very One who had created him. This rebel enticed the first woman, Eve, to eat the forbidden fruit. Referring to her and her husband, Adam, the angel said: “You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” (Genesis 2:16, 17; 3:1-5) The rebellious angel came to be called Devil and Satan.​—Revelation 12:9.
Did Eve pay attention to Satan’s words? The Bible tells us: “The woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes, yes, the tree was desirable to look upon. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward she gave some also to her husband when with her and he began eating it.” (Genesis 3:6) Yes, the first couple, Adam and Eve, joined Satan in his rebellion. As a consequence, they lost Paradise for themselves and for their descendants. Children who were to be born perfect with eternal life ahead of them would instead inherit sin and death.​—Romans 5:12.
How did Jehovah God, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, respond? He purposed to make provision for the forgiveness of sins. (Romans 5:8) Jehovah God has also established a governmental arrangement to manage the crisis. This arrangement is called “the kingdom of God.” (Luke 21:31) Set up as a subsidiary to God’s universal rulership, this Kingdom has a specific purpose.
What is the purpose of God’s Kingdom? What are some of its aspects, and how do they compare with human rulership? When was the Kingdom to begin ruling? These questions will be discussed in the following article.

October 16–November 12: Special campaign distribution of Kingdom News No. 37, “The End of False Religion Is Near!” November 13-30: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: The Knowledge book or any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have these books may offer the Keep on the Watch! brochure.
▪ Since December has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ The insert in this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry is the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2007” and should be kept for reference throughout 2007.
▪ The video program No Blood​—Medicine Meets the Challenge will be considered at a Service Meeting in January. If needed, the DVD or videocassette should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.
▪ The special public talk for the 2007 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 15, 2007. The subject of the talk will be announced later. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer or an assembly that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 15.

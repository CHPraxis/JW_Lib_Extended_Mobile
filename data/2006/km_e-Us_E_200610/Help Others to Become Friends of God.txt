Help Others to Become Friends of God
1 Today, people out of all nations are being taught Jehovah’s ways. (Isa. 2:2, 3) For such ones to “bear fruit with endurance,” however, they must come to love Jehovah. (Luke 8:15; Mark 12:30) Without such love, they will not have the strength to resist unwholesome influences or the courage to do what is right. One way to help others develop a good relationship with Jehovah is to build in them appreciation for his qualities. Encourage them to give thoughtful consideration to the information in the book Draw Close to Jehovah.
2 Your Example: Your personal actions can have a powerful effect on the hearts of Bible students. When they see that you treasure your friendship with Jehovah and see how it affects your life, they may be motivated to cultivate such a personal relationship themselves. (Luke 6:40) Indeed, our example often has a greater influence on others than what we say.
3 A major means by which parents teach their children to love Jehovah is by their example. (Deut. 6:4-9) One couple desirous of raising their children in the truth asked successful parents for advice. “The common thread with everyone I spoke to was parental example,” said the husband. Thus, by their entire way of life, parents can give their children a living example of what it means to be “Jehovah’s friend.”​—Jas. 2:23.
4 Heartfelt Prayer: You can also help others to cultivate friendship with Jehovah by teaching them to pray from the heart. You might direct them to Jesus’ model prayer, as well as to the many earnest prayers recorded in the Scriptures. (Matt. 6:9, 10) You can teach your children and Bible students how to pray by your own prayers. When they hear your heartfelt expressions, they sense your feelings toward Jehovah. Encourage them to “persevere in prayer” when they face trials. (Rom. 12:12) As they experience Jehovah’s help in times of need, they will come to trust him and love him as a true friend.​—Ps. 34:8; Phil. 4:6, 7.

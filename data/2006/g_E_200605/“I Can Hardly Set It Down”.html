<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Last year a new 224-page colorfully illustrated book designed for study of basic Bible teachings was released at conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the world. It is entitled <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I can hardly set it down,” wrote one reader. “This book has gathered all the best of every study book that I have seen and put it all in these few pages.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another reader said: “Every page encourages you to read on. I also like the way the end of each chapter tells you what is coming up in the following chapter. There are many passages that have brought tears to my eyes. There are so many things I love about this book that I could write a book about it!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Still another appreciative person wrote: “Believe me, this book is a jewel of incalculable value in a spiritual sense, and it will be an excellent tool to help teach new disciples.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach</em>? is now available upon request in more than 140 languages. You may ask for a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

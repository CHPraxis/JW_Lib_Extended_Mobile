<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sc"><strong>MAKE CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sc">  Connect what you read with what you already know about yourself and your surroundings. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="su">▪ <strong>Text-to-Text </strong>Do the situations or problems described resemble those depicted in other books, magazines, or stories I have read? Do the characters share similar traits with other people I have learned about?</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="su">▪ <strong>Text-to-Self </strong>How does this information relate to my circumstances, my culture, my dilemmas? Can I use the material to help me deal with problems or to make my life better?</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="su">▪ <strong>Text-to-Surroundings </strong>What does this material teach me about nature, the environment, different cultures, or problems in society? What does this information teach me about the Creator?</p>

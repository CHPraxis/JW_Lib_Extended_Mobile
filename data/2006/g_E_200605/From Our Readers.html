<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>How to Find a Job and Keep It </strong>(July 8, 2005)  I appreciated your recommendation to follow up on each job opportunity, even if it seems to involve menial work. I recently wanted to cut down to part-time employment so that I could devote more time to my Christian ministry. But I was being too particular about the type of work I would accept. Then I was offered another job, which I accepted. It is menial work, but I’m making an effort to be satisfied with it. At least I’m not mentally exhausted when I come home, and I can concentrate on my personal study of the Bible.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>May Day<wbr />—What Does It Mean to You? </strong>(April 22, 2005)  I am a senior in high school, and a May Day festival is held at my school each year. There is a dress rehearsal, and all the high-school and middle-school students are asked to watch it. I attended them before, but the festival bothered my sister’s conscience. This article helped me to realize that she was right! Thank you so much. The article came at a perfect time!</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Facing Illness With a Sense of Humor </strong>(April 22, 2005)  I have been battling ovarian cancer for the past six years, and several times I have undergone surgery and chemotherapy. Like Conchi, I try to support my congregation and to attend all the meetings and conventions as I am able. Cancer is a challenging disease, so I appreciate Conchi’s comments about how to cope with the bad news that it seems we cancer patients constantly receive from doctors. Conchi’s experience was really encouraging to me!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I suffer from lupus, and on one occasion I even had amnesia for a time. While recuperating, I tried to keep my sense of humor. Recently, when I was hospitalized for gastritis, I tried to do the same. I agree with Conchi’s words, “It’s no joke being sick, but you have to try to keep your sense of humor.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Watching the World </strong>(July 8, 2005)  Regarding the item entitled “Vitamin Supplements and Cancer,” I would like to point out that the views of Dr. Sullivan as quoted are <em>not </em>shared by many nutritionists. Reports in countless scientific publications and a multitude of studies have shown that the substances you list have proved useful in preventing<wbr />—and treating—<wbr />some forms of cancer. I feel that including one-sided information of this nature could endanger the neutral stand of <em>Awake!</em></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si"><strong><em>“Awake!” responds: </em></strong>Evidently, as this reader notes, studies have shown that the substances mentioned in our item have in a number of cases had a beneficial effect upon cancer patients. We regret any misunderstanding that publishing this item may have caused. “Awake!” takes a neutral position when it comes to health treatments. The fact that we present health-related information for our readers’ consideration does not mean that we endorse it. Likewise, when we quote a publication or an expert in some field of study, we understand that<wbr />—as is often the case—<wbr />other publications and other experts may hold a different view. We leave it up to our readers to make informed decisions when it comes to their health.</p>

“It Is Fabulous!”
“It is such an easy read, the illustrations are incredibly effective, the appendix for additional information is just great, and the book really appeals to a person’s heart. It is fabulous!”—John and Paula.
“What Does the Bible Really Teach? is absolutely breathtaking in its clarity and simplicity! Surely it will motivate new Bible students to throw off all the things that impede their progress toward serving Jehovah with a complete heart. Perhaps you can tell that I am thrilled with the book far more than words can express.”—Joe.
“You have captured what people are really thinking, what is really going on in their minds. And you have given all the answers from God’s Word, the Bible.”—Robert.
“It is absolutely beautiful and is written with easy-to-understand sentences and beautiful explanations. It is bound to reach many hearts.”—Norma.

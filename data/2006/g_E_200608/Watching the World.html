<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">According to Cláudio Hummes, archbishop of São Paulo, the proportion of Brazilians who are Catholic has fallen from 83 percent to 67 percent over the last 14 years. The prelate blames the church’s “inability, for various reasons, to preach the gospel to its baptized members thoroughly.” Says Hummes: “We have to reach out to the faithful, from house to house, in the schools, in institutions, and not just in the parishes.” <em>Folha Online </em>notes that this work will have to be undertaken by laity who are trained as missionaries. A shortage of priests is one of the major problems facing the Catholic Church in Brazil and in the rest of Latin America as a whole.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In a decision published on February 10, 2006, the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig, Germany, ruled that the State of Berlin must recognize the Religious Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany as a public corporation. This ended a 15-year-long legal battle, during which the case was reviewed by several different German courts, including the Federal Constitutional Court. As a public corporation, the Religious Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany is entitled to tax exemptions and other privileges enjoyed by the country’s major religious denominations.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“Internet game addiction is rife among China’s youth,” says Hong Kong’s <em>South China Morning Post. </em>The phenomenon is also evident among youngsters from other areas of the Orient, such as Hong Kong, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The newspaper notes: “The growing desire to plug in and tune out reflects a backlash against society’s stranglehold on kids that stems from parents’ weighty expectations and cutthroat competition to get into university.” It is estimated that up to six million Chinese children need help to overcome the addiction.</p>

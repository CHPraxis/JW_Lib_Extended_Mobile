“It Is Simply Fantastic!”
▪ In Brazil a teacher of geography was fascinated with the educational value of Awake! He wrote: “The magazine provides me with more teaching material than many of the publications intended for the educational field. Although my religious beliefs differ, I fully agree with the values Awake! conveys.”
This teacher came to realize, however, that Awake! is only one of the many publications Jehovah’s Witnesses provide. He wrote: “One student in the sixth grade lent me the brochure ‘See the Good Land.’ I was amazed by the quality of the information. It is simply fantastic! The ability to visualize and locate Bible events gives Bible study added meaning, especially for young people.”
He added: “Your publications are everywhere: on the bus, among the students, and even in the line at the bank. I am glad to see that they are reaching needy communities where access to good information is very difficult to come by. Congratulations for your wonderful work.”
“See the Good Land” is available in about 80 languages. It is filled with full-color maps and photographs that illustrate different areas of the Biblical world, particularly the Promised Land during various periods.

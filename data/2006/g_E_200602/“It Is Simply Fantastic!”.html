<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ In Brazil a teacher of geography was fascinated with the educational value of <em>Awake! </em>He wrote: “The magazine provides me with more teaching material than many of the publications intended for the educational field. Although my religious beliefs differ, I fully agree with the values <em>Awake! </em>conveys.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This teacher came to realize, however, that <em>Awake! </em>is only one of the many publications Jehovah’s Witnesses provide. He wrote: “One student in the sixth grade lent me the brochure <em>‘See the Good Land.’ </em>I was amazed by the quality of the information. It is simply fantastic! The ability to visualize and locate Bible events gives Bible study added meaning, especially for young people.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">He added: “Your publications are everywhere: on the bus, among the students, and even in the line at the bank. I am glad to see that they are reaching needy communities where access to good information is very difficult to come by. Congratulations for your wonderful work.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>“See the Good Land” </em>is available in about 80 languages.

“Do You Observe Grandmother’s Day?”
IT WAS a cold winter morning. Natalia, a 16-year-old girl in Poland, was waiting for a train when two journalists from a local newspaper approached her and asked, “Do you observe Grandmother’s Day?”
In Poland, Grandmother’s Day, Grandfather’s Day, Mother’s Day, Women’s Day, and Teacher’s Day are all special days. Young children commonly celebrate Grandmother’s Day and Grandfather’s Day by making greeting cards, while older children give presents or flowers to their grandparents.
At first, words failed Natalia when she was asked the above question. But after offering a silent prayer, she told the journalists, “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I do not observe Grandmother’s Day.” The journalists seemed surprised. Natalia then smiled and added: “I live with my grandmother, so I can bring her flowers, talk to her, and express gratitude for her kindness every day. Why should I honor her only once a year?”
That thoughtful expression impressed the journalists, as it might you as well. The next day the morning newspaper printed both Natalia’s words and her photograph.
Does this example cause you to ask yourself whether you too are prepared to explain reasons for your beliefs and conduct, especially when unexpectedly questioned? True worshippers of God will seek to honor him by always being ready to provide reasons for what they believe and by willingly doing so whenever possible.—1 Peter 3:15.

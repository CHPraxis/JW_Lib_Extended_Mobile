<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Both the giver and the receiver have joy when a present fills a need and when it is really appreciated. Not long ago a high-ranking civil servant in Mexico wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses to express thanks for receiving a copy of the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>Her letter says in part:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The content of this book is really invaluable. I recognize that even though the information is based on a very ancient book, it is up-to-date and applies to our daily life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am convinced that as parents we should inculcate in our children values that allow them to discern how to act and that help them to become capable people and to conduct themselves with respect and honesty in a world lacking these things. Above all, we should help them to recognize the existence of a loving, kind Supreme Being. Believe me, the material you sent will be very useful, both professionally in my work and in the task entrusted to parents by our Creator of helping our little ones grow up to be people who love their neighbors.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This civil servant recognized the value of the lessons drawn from the teachings and example of Jesus Christ that are presented in <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>You too may receive a copy of this beautifully illustrated 256-page book, which has the same page size as this magazine.

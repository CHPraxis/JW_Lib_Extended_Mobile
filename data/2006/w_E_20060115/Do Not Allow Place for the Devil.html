<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 1. Why have many questioned the existence of the Devil?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">FOR centuries, many people thought of the Devil as a horned, cloven-hoofed creature clad in red and using a pitchfork to cast wicked humans into a fiery hell. The Bible does not support that idea. Undoubtedly, however, such misconceptions have caused millions to question the existence of the Devil or to think that the term applies only to a principle of evil.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 2. What are some Scriptural facts about the Devil?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Bible provides eyewitness evidence and clear testimony that the Devil exists. Jesus Christ saw him in the heavenly spirit realm and spoke to him on the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 4:4-11</a>) Although the Scriptures do not reveal this spirit creature’s original name, they call him the Devil (meaning “Slanderer”) because he has slandered God. He is also called Satan (meaning “Resister”), since he resists Jehovah. Satan the Devil is referred to as “the original serpent,” apparently because he used a serpent to deceive Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:14-54:2:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 2:14</a>) He is also known as “the wicked one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:13-40:6:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:13</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 3. We will consider what question?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As Jehovah’s servants, in no way do we want to resemble Satan, the archenemy of the only true God. We must therefore heed the apostle Paul’s counsel: “Do not give the Devil a chance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:27-49:4:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:27</a>, <em>Byington</em>) What, then, are some of Satan’s traits that we must not imitate?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Do Not Imitate the Great Slanderer</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4. How did “the wicked one” slander God?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>“The wicked one” deserves to be called the Devil, for he is a slanderer. Slander is a false, malicious, and defamatory statement about someone. God commanded Adam: “As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:17-1:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17</a>) Eve had been informed of this, but through a serpent, the Devil told her: “You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:4, 5</a>) That was malicious slander against Jehovah God!</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5. Why did Diotrephes deserve to be called to account for slandering?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The Israelites were commanded: “You must not go around among your people for the sake of slandering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:16-3:19:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:16</a>) The apostle John stated concerning a slanderer in <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>his day: “I wrote something to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who likes to have the first place among them, does not receive anything from us with respect. That is why, if I come, I will call to remembrance his works which he goes on doing, chattering about us with wicked words.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:9-64:1:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">3 John 9, 10</a>) Diotrephes was slandering John and deserved to be called to account for it. What loyal Christian would want to be like Diotrephes and imitate Satan, the great slanderer?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">6, 7. Why would we want to avoid slandering anyone?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Slanderous statements and false accusations are often hurled against Jehovah’s servants. “The chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing [Jesus].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:10-42:23:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 23:10</a>) Paul was falsely accused by High Priest Ananias and others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:1-44:24:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 24:1-8</a>) And the Bible speaks of Satan as “the accuser of our brothers . . . , who accuses them day and night before our God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>) Those falsely accused brothers are the anointed Christians on earth in these last days.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>No Christian would want to slander anyone or make false accusations. Yet, that could happen if we did not have all the facts before bearing witness against someone. Under the Mosaic Law, deliberately testifying falsely could result in death for the accuser. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:16-2:20:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 20:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:15-5:19:19" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 19:15-19</a>) Moreover, things detestable to Jehovah include “a false witness that launches forth lies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>) Surely, then, we want to avoid imitating the principal slanderer and false accuser.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. In what way was the Devil “a manslayer when he began”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The Devil is a manslayer. “That one was a manslayer when he began,” said Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) Beginning with his first act in turning Adam and Eve away from God, Satan has been a manslayer. He brought death upon the first human pair and their offspring. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) It may be noted that this action can be attributed only to a person, not to a mere principle of evil.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9. As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:15-62:3:15" data-bid="53-1" class="b">1 John 3:15</a>, how can we become manslayers?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>“You must not murder,” states one of the Ten Commandments given to Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:17-5:5:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>) Addressing Christians, the apostle Peter wrote: “Let none of you suffer as a murderer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:15-60:4:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:15</a>) So as Jehovah’s servants, we would not commit murder. Yet, we would bear guilt before God if we hated a fellow Christian and wished him dead. “Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer [or, “murderer”],” wrote the apostle John, “and you know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:15-62:3:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 John 3:15</a>; <em>New International Version</em>) The Israelites were commanded: “You must not hate your brother in your heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:17-3:19:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:17</a>) May we be quick to resolve any problem that arises between us and a fellow believer, so that the manslayer Satan does not destroy our Christian unity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:3-42:17:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 17:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The Devil is a liar. “When he speaks the lie,” said Jesus, “he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) Satan lied to Eve, whereas Jesus came into the world to bear witness to the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) If we are to stand firm against the Devil as followers of Christ, we cannot resort to lies and deception.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>The spirit creature who became the Devil was once in the truth. But “he did not stand fast in the truth,” said Jesus, “because truth is not in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) This foremost apostate has pursued a relentless course of resistance to “the God of truth.” Some first-century Christians fell into “the snare of the Devil,” apparently becoming his victims because of being misled and deviating from the truth. So Paul urged his coworker Timothy to instruct them with mildness so that they might recover spiritually and get free from Satan’s snare. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:23-55:2:26" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:23-26</a>) Of course, it is much better to cling firmly to the truth and not be ensnared by apostate views in the first place.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Because of listening to the Devil and not rejecting his lies, the first human pair apostatized. So, then, should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:9-63:1:11" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2 John 9-11</a>) May we never succumb to the Devil’s wiles by abandoning the Christian “path of truth” to follow false teachers who seek to “introduce ruinous ideologies” and try to ‘exploit us with well-turned phrases.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>, <em>Byington.</em></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Paul told Christian elders from Ephesus: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>In about 65 C.E., the apostle urged Timothy to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’ “But,” wrote Paul, “shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; for they will advance to more and more ungodliness, and their word will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of that number. These very men have deviated from the <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.” Apostasy had begun! “For all that,” added Paul, “the solid foundation of God stays standing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:19" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:15-19</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Satan has often used apostates in an effort to corrupt true worship​—but to no avail. About the year 1868, Charles Taze Russell began a careful examination of long-accepted doctrines of Christendom’s churches and found misinterpretations of the Scriptures. Russell and a few other truth-seekers formed a Bible study class in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In the nearly 140 years since then, Jehovah’s servants have grown in knowledge and love of God and his Word. Despite the wiles of the foremost apostate, the spiritual vigilance of the faithful and discreet slave class has helped these true Christians to remain loyal to Jehovah and his Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>.</p>

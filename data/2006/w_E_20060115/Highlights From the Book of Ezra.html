<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Ezra</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Bible book of Ezra picks up where Second Chronicles leaves off. Its writer, Ezra the priest, begins the account with the issuing of a decree by King Cyrus of Persia that allows a remnant of the Jews exiled in Babylon to return to their homeland. The narrative ends with Ezra’s taking measures to cleanse those who have defiled themselves with the people of the land. All in all, the book covers a period of 70 years​—from 537 to 467 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In writing the book, Ezra has a clear objective: to show how Jehovah fulfilled His promise to free His people from exile in Babylon and to restore true worship in Jerusalem. Hence, Ezra focuses only on the events that pertain to this purpose. The book of Ezra is an account of how the temple was rebuilt and how Jehovah’s worship was reestablished despite opposition and the imperfection of God’s people. The account is of great interest to us because we too are living in a time of restoration. Many are streaming to “the mountain of Jehovah,” and the entire earth is about to be “filled with the knowing of the glory of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:14-35:2:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Habakkuk 2:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In response to Cyrus’ liberation decree, about 50,000 Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem under the leadership of Governor Zerubbabel, or Sheshbazzar. The returnees promptly set up the altar on its site and begin to offer sacrifices to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The following year the Israelites lay the foundation of the house of Jehovah. Enemies keep interfering with the rebuilding work and eventually succeed in getting a royal command issued to halt the work. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah stir up the people so that they resume the temple construction despite the ban. The fear of opposing an unalterable Persian decree originally issued by Cyrus keeps their adversaries at bay. An official investigation brings to light Cyrus’ order “concerning the house of God in Jerusalem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:3-15:6:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 6:3</a>) The work progresses well and comes to completion.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:3-15:1:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1:3-6</strong></a>​<strong>—Were the Israelites who did not volunteer to return to their homeland weak in faith? </strong>Some may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship, but this was not true in every case. First of all, the 1,000-mile <strong>[1,600 km] </strong>journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning.</p>

Among them were the descendants of the Gibeonites of Joshua’s day and others “whom David and the princes gave to the service of the Levites.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:20-15:8:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 8:20</a>.</p>

Ezra mentions this only as a possibility. The Scriptures contain no record of the use of the Urim and the Thummim then or thereafter. Jewish tradition has it that the Urim and the Thummim disappeared with the destruction of the temple in 607 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:12-15:3:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>3:12</strong></a>​<strong>—Why did “the old men that had seen the former house” of Jehovah weep? </strong>These men could remember how magnificent the temple built by Solomon was. The groundwork of the new temple that was before them was “as nothing in [their] eyes” in comparison. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:2-37:2:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Haggai 2:2, 3</a>) Would their efforts bring back the glory of the former temple?

The ban continued until 520 B.C.E., the second year of King Darius. The temple was completed in the sixth year of his reign, or 515 B.C.E. (See the box entitled “Persian Kings From 537 to 467 B.C.E.”) Thus, the temple construction took about 20 years.</p>

Returning to Jerusalem meant building a new life under uncomfortable and dangerous circumstances. The Jerusalem of the day did not hold out attractive material prospects to the Jews who might have been prospering in <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>Babylon. Not to be overlooked was the dangerous journey. The returnees had to have strong faith in Jehovah, zeal for true worship, and courage to make the move. Even Ezra strengthened himself according to the hand of Jehovah upon him. With Ezra’s encouragement, 1,500 families​—perhaps numbering 6,000 people—​responded. After Ezra took additional initiatives, 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim responded.</p>

Because some had formed marriage alliances with the idol-worshipping people, the entire nation might eventually be assimilated into the pagan nations.

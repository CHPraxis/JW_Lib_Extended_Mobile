Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Family Happiness book. July and August: What Does the Bible Really Teach? When householders already have this publication, use an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. Follow up all placements by making return visits with the objective of starting Bible studies.
▪ Since July has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ The video program Young People Ask​—How Can I Make Real Friends? will be considered at a Service Meeting in September. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: September 9, 2006 (Gilead graduation); October 7, 2006 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 10, 2007 (Gilead graduation); and May 11-12, 2007 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.

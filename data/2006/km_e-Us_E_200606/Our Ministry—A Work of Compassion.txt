Our Ministry​—A Work of Compassion
1 Jesus observed that the multitudes who listened to his message were “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) With tenderness and love, he taught them Jehovah’s ways, brought comfort, and compassionately ministered to their spiritual needs. As we meditate upon his ways, we learn to think and feel as Jesus did, and this quality of compassion becomes evident in our ministry.
2 Just take a moment to think about how Jesus responded when people who were desperate for help approached him. (Luke 5:12, 13; 8:43-48) He was considerate of those with special circumstances. (Mark 7:31-35) He was aware of the feelings of others and showed concern. He looked beyond outward appearances. (Luke 7:36-40) Indeed, Jesus perfectly reflected the tender compassion of our God.
3 “Moved With Pity”: Jesus did not conduct his ministry out of a mere sense of duty. He was “moved with pity” for people. (Mark 6:34) Similarly today, we are not just delivering a message but trying to save precious lives. Seek to understand why people respond the way they do. Why are they anxious or preoccupied? Have they been neglected and blinded by false religious shepherds? Our genuine interest in others may move them to listen to the good news.​—2 Cor. 6:4, 6.
4 Compassion touches hearts. To illustrate: One woman suffered the tragic loss of her three-month-old daughter. When two Witnesses called at her door, she invited them in with the intention of refuting their arguments about why God permits suffering. However, the woman later said: “They listened to me with great compassion, and when they were leaving, I felt so much better that I agreed to another visit.” Do you strive to show compassion to everyone you meet in the ministry?
5 Cultivating compassion will help us to share real comfort with others. Doing so, we glorify “the Father of tender mercies,” Jehovah.​—2 Cor. 1:3.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah used his prophets to warn about what is ahead<wbr />—the outpouring of his anger. But we should not think of him as an angry God. He is “joyful over [his people] with happy cries.” While keeping in expectation of his great day, we have every reason to “rejoice and exult with all the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:14-36:3:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:3:17-36:3:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17</a>) How can you manifest this in your actions and attitude?

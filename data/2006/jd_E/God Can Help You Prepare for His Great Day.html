<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The great day of Jehovah is near,” said God’s prophet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:14</a>) That day is fast approaching, so we need to live with it in mind. Do you realize that the so-called Minor Prophets have something important to say to you about that great day? Chapters 1 to 3 of this book will help you to become familiar with those 12 prophets and the themes of their books. Thus you can benefit from what they wrote, finding lessons that are practical for your life.</p>

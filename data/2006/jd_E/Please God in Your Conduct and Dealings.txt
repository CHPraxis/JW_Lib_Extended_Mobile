SECTION 3
Please God in Your Conduct and Dealings




How would you answer the question: “What is Jehovah asking back from you?” (Micah 6:8) The writings of the 12 prophets offer insights into this. As you will see in Chapters 8 to 10 of this book, those writings can help you to cope with such challenges as how to be truthful in all you say and how to avoid violence. You will also discover practical advice that they offer about family life, advice that you can likely use.

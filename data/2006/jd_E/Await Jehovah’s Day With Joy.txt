SECTION 4
Await Jehovah’s Day With Joy




Jehovah used his prophets to warn about what is ahead—the outpouring of his anger. But we should not think of him as an angry God. He is “joyful over [his people] with happy cries.” While keeping in expectation of his great day, we have every reason to “rejoice and exult with all the heart.” (Zephaniah 3:14, 17) How can you manifest this in your actions and attitude? And why can you be thankful for what you consider from the 12 prophetic books?

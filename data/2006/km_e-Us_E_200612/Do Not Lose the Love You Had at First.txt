Do Not Lose the Love You Had at First
1 The glorified Jesus counseled the first-century congregation in Ephesus: “I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.” (Rev. 2:4) Evidently, many had lost their first love for Jehovah. When we were learning the truth, we developed a strong love for God and neighbor, and this moved us to share our newfound hope with zeal. What will prevent us from losing the love we had at first and from slowing down in the ministry?
2 Personal Study and Meeting Attendance: What caused us to develop love for God and neighbor when we first learned the truth? Was it not all that we learned about Jehovah from our study of the Scriptures? (1 John 4:16, 19) Therefore, so that our love “may abound yet more and more,” we must continue taking in accurate knowledge, digging into “the deep things of God.”​—Phil. 1:9-11; 1 Cor. 2:10.
3 Maintaining a good routine of personal study can be a real challenge in these last days filled with many anxieties and distractions. (2 Tim. 3:1) We must set aside time in our schedule to take in spiritual food. Attending congregation meetings regularly is also vital, especially as we “behold the day drawing near.”​—Heb. 10:24, 25.
4 The Ministry: Zealous participation in the ministry helps us to keep our first love for God. As we preach the good news, we remind ourselves of Jehovah’s loving promises, and this helps us to keep our hope bright and our love alive. Teaching Bible truths requires that we do research to understand them clearly ourselves, and this strengthens our faith.​—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.
5 Jehovah is deserving of all things, including our love. (Rev. 4:11) Do not allow yours to fade. Keep your first love strong by earnest personal Bible study, regular meeting attendance, and zealously declaring to others what is most dear to your heart.​—Rom. 10:10.

Question Box
▪ Would it be appropriate to arrange yard sales or other fund-raising events to help the congregation?
It is common for religious organizations to sponsor fund-raising events, such as dinners, sales, or festivals. While some may feel that these are for a good cause, the events amount to forms of solicitation. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not obtain financial support in that way.
The second issue of the Watch Tower, August 1879, said this about our refusal to imitate the churches and solicit funds: “‘Zion’s Watch Tower’ has, we believe JEHOVAH for its backer, and while this is the case it will never beg nor petition men for support. When He who says: ‘All the gold and silver of the mountains are mine,’ fails to provide necessary funds, we will understand it to be time to suspend the publication.”
We continue to follow the Scriptural principle: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7) Contribution boxes are kept in the Kingdom Hall so that individuals can make voluntary donations if they wish. (2 Ki. 12:9) Contributions are not solicited; neither are they given with the idea of obtaining something in return.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>Would it be appropriate to arrange yard sales or other fund-raising events to help the congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is common for religious organizations to sponsor fund-raising events, such as dinners, sales, or festivals. While some may feel that these are for a good cause, the events amount to forms of solicitation. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not obtain financial support in that way.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The second issue of the <em>Watch Tower, </em>August 1879, said this about our refusal to imitate the churches and solicit funds: “‘Zion’s Watch Tower’ has, we believe JEHOVAH for its backer, and while this is the case it will never <em>beg </em>nor <em>petition </em>men for support. When He who says: ‘All the gold and silver of the mountains are mine,’ fails to provide necessary funds, we will understand it to be time to suspend the publication.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We continue to follow the Scriptural principle: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7</a>) Contribution boxes are kept in the Kingdom Hall so that individuals can make voluntary donations if they wish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:12:9-12:12:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:9</a>) Contributions are not solicited; neither are they given with the idea of obtaining something in return.</p>

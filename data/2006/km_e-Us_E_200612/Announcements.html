<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​</em>—<em>God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>The <em>Knowledge </em>book or any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have these books may offer the <em>Keep on the Watch! </em>brochure. <strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah</em>. If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Worship God </em>book. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of September, October, and November. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See <em>Instructions for Congregation Accounting </em>(S-27).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial invitations for 2007 in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested as soon as possible on a <em>Literature Request Form </em>(S-14). A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2008 will be on Saturday, March 22, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building. Because of the importance of the Memorial observance, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the speaker instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. However, if there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk, he should be selected.</p>

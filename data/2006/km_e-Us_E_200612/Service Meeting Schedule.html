Discuss points needing emphasis locally from the October 2006 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.

Since we will finish reading the Hebrew Scriptures from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:1-23:24:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 24</a> to the end of Malachi during 2007, this year will be an opportune time for brothers assigned to prepare Bible highlights and for others who offer comments to make use of our publications that illuminate these prophetic books. Interview two or three publishers from among the following: a new student, a young student who is making good progress, and an experienced student. Have them relate the effects of the school on their ministry and on their spirituality. Encourage all to be diligent in fulfilling their assignments, in participating in Bible highlights, and in applying the suggestions given weekly from <em>Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education.</em></p>

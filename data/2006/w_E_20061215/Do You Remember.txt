Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• What can help a true Christian if a loved one leaves Jehovah?
Build up yourself and other faithful family members. Stay absorbed in spiritual activities. Be available to help others. Never give up hope that the loved one may return. Do not blame yourself. Respect God’s arrangement for discipline, and express your feelings to friends.​—9/1, pages 18-21.
• What are two ways that the Scriptures help to identify “the last days”?
The Bible foretells events that would take place during “the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matthew 24:3, 7, 8; Luke 21:11) It also describes changes in the attitudes and actions of people who live during “the last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5) Significantly, the good news of the kingdom was to be preached during this time.​—9/15, pages 4-6.
• What is the congregation’s responsibility if a Christian driving an automobile has an accident that results in the death of others?
Elders looking into the matter may find that there is no bloodguilt because the driver had little or no control over what caused the fatality. But if there is bloodguilt and the guilty person is repentant, he will receive Scriptural reproof and will be restricted as to privileges in the congregation.​—9/15, page 30.
• Why is everlasting life not dependent on scientific advancements?
There are scientific efforts toward the lengthening of life, such as by attempting to overcome an apparent limit to the number of times that cells regenerate or by therapeutic cloning to provide patients with new, compatible organs. But the Bible shows that the only means by which humans can gain everlasting life is Jesus’ ransom.​—10/1, pages 3-5.
• Was Jewish ritual bathing a forerunner of Christian baptism?
It was not. The Jews performed cleansing rites upon themselves, which John’s baptism did not call for. The cleansing required by the Mosaic Law had to be repeated, but Christian baptism is performed only once.​—10/15, pages 12-13.
• What is the Ministerial Training School?
It is an eight-week course for congregation elders and ministerial servants who are single and are in a position to be assigned to serve where there is a great need. That might be with the congregation from which they came, elsewhere in that land, or in another country.​—11/15, pages 10-11.
• What or who is the antichrist mentioned at 1 John 2:18; 4:3?
In a broad sense, “antichrist” refers to all who oppose or lyingly claim to be Christ or his representatives. The words of Jesus and John show that the antichrist is a composite entity made up of many individual antichrists who spread religious deception and reject God’s Kingdom.​—12/1, pages 4-6.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TEN years ago this month, the magazine <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report </em>featured the cover story “In Search of Christmas.” The article focused on whether Christmas was becoming “purer, less commercial.” Are things going that way?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The article offered insight into reasons why we should not expect that. It noted: “There is no record of official observance of Christ’s birth until the fourth century, when Constantine . . . was emperor of Rome.” That reflected “at least in part the fact that no one knew for sure when Jesus was born.” The article admitted that “the gospels are silent on the year, let alone the exact month or day.” According to a University of Texas historian, “the earliest Christians simply weren’t interested in celebrating the Nativity.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Under the subhead “Matter of Conjecture,” the article considered “how the church arrived at December 25.” It acknowledged: “Most widely held is the view that the holiday was an intentional ‘Christianization’ of Saturnalia and other pagan festivals.” “By assigning Christmas to late December, when people already were accustomed to celebrating, church leaders ensured widespread observance of the Savior’s birth.” In the mid-19th century, emphasis shifted to buying and giving gifts. “The new tradition of Christmas gift giving created an instant retail bonanza, and merchants and advertisers soon began to promote the season.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There is thus no reason to expect that Christmas should go any way except away from pure Christianity. While modern Christmas abounds in “gaudy commercialism,” the fact is that true Christians never expected to celebrate Jesus’ birth. Rather, the Bible emphasizes the ransom that Christ provided by his death and resurrection to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) That will remain of importance through all time to come.</p>

How to Start Studies in the Bible Teach Book
Many of us would be delighted to conduct a Bible study if only we could get the study started. The new book What Does the Bible Really Teach? can help us. The preface on pages 3-7 is designed to get the householder into a Bible discussion using the publication. Even those with limited experience in the ministry will find it easy to use to start studies.
▪ You might try this approach using page 3:
After mentioning a news item or a problem that is on the minds of people in your territory, direct the householder’s attention to the questions in bold type on page 3, and invite him to comment. Then turn to pages 4-5.
▪ Or you might prefer to start by highlighting pages 4-5:
You could say, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the changes pictured here actually took place?” Or you might ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Listen carefully to the response.
If the householder shows a special interest in one of the scriptures, show him what the Bible teaches on that subject by considering the paragraphs in the book that discuss that text. (See box on this page of insert.) Consider the material just as you would on a Bible study. This can be done in five to ten minutes on the initial call right at the doorstep.
▪ Another approach is to draw the person out using page 6:
Direct the householder’s attention to the questions at the bottom of the page, and ask, “Have you ever wondered about any of these questions?” If he expresses interest in one of the questions, turn to the paragraphs in the book that answer the question. (See box on this page of insert.) As you consider the information together, you are conducting a Bible study.
▪ Page 7 may be used to lead into a demonstration of a Bible study:
Read the first three sentences on the page, and then turn to chapter 3 and demonstrate a study using paragraphs 1-3. Arrange to return to discuss the answers to the questions in paragraph 3.
▪ How to arrange to return:
When concluding the initial study, arrange to continue the discussion. You might simply say: “In just a few minutes, we learned what the Bible teaches on an important subject. Next time, we can discuss [leave a question that will be considered]. May I stop by at this same time next week?”
As we draw closer to Jehovah’s appointed time, he continues to equip us for the task at hand. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 2 Tim. 3:17) Let us make good use of this marvelous new tool to start Bible studies.

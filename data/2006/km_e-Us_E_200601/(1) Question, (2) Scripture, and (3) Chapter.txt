(1) Question, (2) Scripture, and (3) Chapter
A simple way to present What Does the Bible Really Teach? is to (1) raise a viewpoint question, (2) read an appropriate scripture, and (3) feature a chapter in the book that discusses that subject by reading the introductory questions under the chapter title. If the householder shows interest, you may be able to demonstrate a Bible study using the opening paragraphs of that chapter. This approach can be used to start a study when making the initial call or a return visit.

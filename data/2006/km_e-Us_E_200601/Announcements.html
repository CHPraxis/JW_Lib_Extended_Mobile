<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Worship the Only True God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since April has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “You Can Enjoy Life in Peace Now​—And Forever!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 12, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ As a reminder, the return address of the branch office should never be used on any personal correspondence. This includes all letters and items of literature that are mailed to give a witness to interested people, to not-at-homes, or to those who live in inaccessible places. A publisher may wish to use his personal return address, since his ministry involves his personal service to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rom. 10:14, 15</a>) However, if he feels that it would be unwise to use his own return address when witnessing by letter, he may use his name and the return address of the Kingdom Hall.​—See the May 2002 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>Question Box.</p>

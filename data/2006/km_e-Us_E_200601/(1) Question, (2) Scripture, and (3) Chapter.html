<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A simple way to present <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>is to (1) raise a viewpoint question, (2) read an appropriate scripture, and (3) feature a chapter in the book that discusses that subject by reading the introductory questions under the chapter title. If the householder shows interest, you may be able to demonstrate a Bible study using the opening paragraphs of that chapter. This approach can be used to start a study when making the initial call or a return visit.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Family Happiness </em>book. <strong>July and August: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>When householders already have this publication, use an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since July has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ <em>Before </em>undertaking a Kingdom Hall construction project​—either new construction or renovation—​the elders should contact their assigned Regional Building Committee. Regional committees have information that can assist congregations in making wise decisions, including the purchase of land and materials as well as other matters. It is prudent to consider suggestions offered by the regional committee <em>before </em>purchasing property and even items such as chairs, wall covering, carpet, and heating and air-conditioning equipment.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office <em>at least 30 days </em>before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the <em>Congregation’s Publisher Record </em>(S-21) card.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Donations made by check for the worldwide work at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office’s financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/​o Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ <strong>DISTRICT CONVENTION CHANGE: </strong>Please note that the three tentative Bronx, NY, “Deliverance at Hand!” District Conventions listed on <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:2006170/1-336">pages 30-1 of the March 1, 2006, <em>Watchtower</em></a> have been canceled.

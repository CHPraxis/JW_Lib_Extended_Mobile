<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From Book One of Psalms</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT would be an appropriate title for a Bible book that consists mostly of praises to our Creator, Jehovah God? No name could be more fitting than Psalms, or Praises. This longest book of the Bible contains beautifully composed songs that recount God’s wonderful qualities and mighty acts and relate numerous prophecies. Many of the songs express the emotions their writers felt while suffering adversity. These expressions span a period of some one thousand years​—from the days of the prophet Moses to postexilic times. The writers were Moses, King David, and others. The priest Ezra is credited with arranging the book in its final form.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From antiquity, the book of Psalms has been divided into five collections, or sections, of songs: (1) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:41:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 1-41</a>, (2) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:42:0-19:72:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 42-72</a>, (3) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:0-19:89:52" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalms 73-89</a>, (4) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:0-19:106:48" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 90-106</a>, and (5) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:1-19:150:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalms 107-150</a>. This article considers the first collection. All but three psalms in this section are attributed to King David of ancient Israel. The composers of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalms 1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:1-19:10:18" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:1-19:33:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">33</a> are not identified.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Describing Jehovah as the Protector of his people, David sings out: “My God is my rock. I shall take refuge in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:2-19:18:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 18:2</a>) Jehovah is praised as the Creator and the Lawgiver in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:0-19:19:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 19</a>, as the Savior in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:20:0-19:20:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 20</a>, and as the Savior of his anointed King in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:21:0-19:21:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 21</a>. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:0-19:23:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> depicts him as the Great Shepherd, whereas the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:0-19:24:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">24th Psalm</a> portrays him as the glorious King.</p>

However, this verse prophetically points to the crown of kingship that Jesus received from Jehovah in 1914. The fact that the crown is made of gold suggests that his reign is of the highest quality.</p>

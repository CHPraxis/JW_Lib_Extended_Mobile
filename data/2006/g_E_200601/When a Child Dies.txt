When a Child Dies
▪ The death of a child is traumatic for the survivors, especially for the parents. A mother whose 16-year-old son was fatally burned in a tragic accident lamented: “God does not allow us to trade places with our dying children, neither does he allow us to die with them.”
Yet, she was not without hope, as she explained: “God has told us the truth about death, and this keeps my husband and me from becoming bitter or losing our minds.” She acknowledged that “our God did not do this to our son, and He has purposed to resurrect the dead to a paradise earth. In our mind’s eye, we can see our son alive, healthy and happy, living among his friends and family.”
Still, even those with confident hope in God’s promise of a resurrection need comfort, which this mother gratefully received from many friends. She noted: “Many of the Scriptural thoughts and acts of kindness shared with us came from the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. We encouraged everyone around us to read it so that they could better understand us and the grief we will continue to experience.”

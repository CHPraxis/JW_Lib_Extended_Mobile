<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TO SOME people the idea of meditating may be intimidating. They may view meditation as a daunting task requiring intense concentration. Such ones may also feel guilty for neglecting meditation, especially when they read of its importance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8</a>) However, silently pondering truths we have learned about Jehovah, his beautiful qualities, his awesome accomplishments, his requirements, and his glorious purpose can and should be a very pleasurable way to spend time. Why?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God is the Supreme Ruler of the universe and is busy working toward the fulfillment of his great purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:17-43:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:17</a>) Even so, he concerns himself with the silent thoughts of each individual worshipper. The psalmist David knew this and wrote under divine inspiration: “O Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me. You yourself have come to know my sitting down and my rising up. You have considered my thought from far off.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:1-19:139:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 139:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At first, someone may view those words of the psalmist negatively. He may reason, ‘Although God is “far off,” he notices every bad thought that comes into my mind.’ Of course, such a realization has its place. It can help us to fight against wrong thoughts and, when we do have such thoughts, to confess them to God, confident that he will forgive us on the basis of our faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:8-62:1:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 1:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2</a>) At the same time, however, we should remember that Jehovah examines his worshippers in a positive way. He pays attention when we think appreciatively about him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Does Jehovah really take note of all the good thoughts of his millions of worshippers?” you may ask. He most certainly does. Jesus emphasized Jehovah’s interest in us when he said that Jehovah takes notice even of little sparrows, and then he added: “You are worth more than many sparrows.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:6-42:12:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 12:6, 7</a>) Sparrows cannot think about Jehovah. So if he cares about them, how much more must he care about us and find delight in the godly thoughts of each one of us! Yes, like David, we can confidently pray: “Let the . . . meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:14-19:19:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 19:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Further proof that Jehovah indeed concerns himself with the meditation of his loyal worshippers is found in the inspired words of the prophet Malachi. Speaking about our day, he foretold: “At that time those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and <em>Jehovah kept paying attention </em>and listening. And a book of remembrance began to be written up before him for those in fear of Jehovah and <em>for those thinking upon his name.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Malachi 3:16</a>) Reminding ourselves that Jehovah keeps “paying attention” when we think about him can indeed make godly meditation a pleasure. Therefore, may we echo the words of the psalmist who wrote: “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:77:12-19:77:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 77:12</a>.</p>

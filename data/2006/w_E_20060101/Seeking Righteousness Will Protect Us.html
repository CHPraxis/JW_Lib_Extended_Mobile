She was conscientious, reporting for work early and not loitering at her job. However, since her position was not permanent, it came up for review.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 3. What is righteousness?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>“Righteousness” implies a state of moral integrity and honesty. In the Bible, the Greek and Hebrew words have the thought of “rectitude” or “uprightness.” It is not self-righteousness, judging oneself by one’s own standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:16:15-42:16:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 16:15</a>) It is uprightness according to Jehovah’s standards. It is God’s righteousness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:17-45:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:21-45:3:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Why is righteousness important? Because Jehovah, the “righteous God,” favors his people when they practice righteousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:4:1-19:4:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:20-20:2:22" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Proverbs 2:20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Habakkuk 1:13</a>) Anyone who works unrighteousness cannot have a close relationship with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:8-20:15:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:8</a>) That is why the apostle Paul urged Timothy: “Flee from the desires incidental to youth, but pursue righteousness,” along with other vital qualities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:22</a>) It is also why Paul included “the breastplate of righteousness” when he listed the various parts of our spiritual armor.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:14-49:6:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5. How can imperfect creatures seek righteousness?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Of course, no human is righteous in a complete sense. All inherit imperfection from Adam, and all are sinful, unrighteous, from birth. Yet, Jesus said that we should seek righteousness. How is that possible? In that Jesus gave his perfect life as a ransom for us, and if we exercise faith in that sacrifice, Jehovah is willing to forgive our sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:8-45:5:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Romans 5:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:18-45:5:18" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> 18</a>) On that basis, as we learn Jehovah’s righteous standards and do our utmost to observe them<wbr />—praying for help to overcome our weaknesses—<wbr />Jehovah accepts our worship.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>When Jesus’ disciples received the commission to be his witnesses “to the most distant part of the earth,” they faced a difficult situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) All their assigned <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>territory was “lying in the power of the wicked one,” Satan.

Only by seeking first God’s righteousness could they endure with their integrity intact.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 7. What responsibilities require that a Christian resist corrupting influences?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Is the world safer for Christians today? By no means! It is even more corrupt than it was in the first century. In addition, Satan has been cast down to the earth and wages vicious warfare against anointed Christians, “the remaining ones of [the woman’s] seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Satan also attacks any who support that “seed.” Yet, Christians cannot hide from the world. While no part of it, they have to live in it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:15-43:17:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 17:15, 16</a>) And they have to preach in it to seek out rightly disposed people and teach them to be disciples of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) Therefore, since Christians cannot entirely avoid the corrupting influences in this world, they have to resist them. Let us consider four of those influences.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>The Trap of Immorality</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8. Why did the Israelites turn to worshipping the gods of the Moabites?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Toward the end of their 40-year trek in the wilderness, a large number of Israelites turned from the path of righteousness. They had witnessed many acts of deliverance by Jehovah, and soon they would march into the Promised Land. Yet, at that critical point, they turned to serving the gods of the Moabites. Why? They succumbed to “the desire of the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) The record says: “The people started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Moab.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:25:1-4:25:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Numbers 25:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">9, 10. What situation today makes it vital always to keep in mind the corrupting power of wrong fleshly desires?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>That episode demonstrates the way wrong fleshly desires can corrupt unwary ones. We do well to learn from it, especially since immorality has become widely viewed as an acceptable lifestyle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:6-46:10:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:8-46:10:8" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 8</a>) A report from the United States says: “Until around 1970, cohabitation [the practice of unmarried couples living together] was illegal in all American states. Now, it is routine. More than half of all first marriages are preceded by cohabitation.” That and similar loose moral practices are not limited to one country. They are found all around the world, and sadly, some Christians have followed the trend<wbr />—even losing their standing in the Christian congregation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><sup>10 </sup>Moreover, propaganda promoting immorality seems to be everywhere. Movies and television programs suggest that it is perfectly acceptable for young people to have sex before marriage. Homosexual relationships are depicted as normal. And many shows depict increasingly graphic sex. Pictures of graphic sex are also easily accessible on the Internet. For instance, a newspaper columnist reported that his seven-year-old son came home from school and excitedly told his father that a school friend had come across an Internet site showing naked women performing sex acts. The father was horrified, but how many children have come across such sites without telling their parents? In addition, how many parents know the contents of the video games their children play? Many popular games feature disgusting immorality, as well as demonism and violence.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>When Paul was in Lystra in Asia Minor, he miraculously healed a man. The account says: “The crowds, seeing what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian tongue: ‘The gods have become like humans and have come down to us!’ And they went calling Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was the one taking the lead in speaking.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:11-44:14:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 14:11, 12</a>) Later those same crowds wanted to kill Paul and Barnabas. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:19-44:14:19" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 14:19</a>) Clearly, those people were very susceptible to community pressure.

Do You Ask for Referrals?
If you are currently conducting a Bible study, why not ask the student if any of his friends, relatives, or acquaintances would also enjoy learning what the Bible teaches? Often several names are given. With the student’s permission, you could mention his name when you visit those individuals to offer a Bible study. You might say, “[Name of student] has enjoyed studying the Bible, and he thought that you too might like to benefit from our free Bible study program.” Then briefly demonstrate how the study is conducted, using the Bible Teach book.
If you have a student who is making good progress, you might encourage him to describe the study arrangement to friends and family members who might be interested. He could invite them to sit in on his study. Or if that is not convenient, he could arrange for you to meet with them to demonstrate the study arrangement. Doing this would encourage the student to begin sharing his Bible knowledge with others.
Those on whom you make regular return visits may also provide you with referrals, even if they themselves have not yet accepted a regular Bible study. When you offer them a copy of the Bible Teach book, you could simply ask, “Do you know anyone else who would enjoy having a copy of this publication?”
In view of the urgency of the times, we want to use every possible means to help people hear and accept the good news. Do you ask for referrals?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Note: </strong>A Service Meeting will be scheduled in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of convention highlights. This is not to be a review of the entire convention program. Rather, highlight only the parts that deal directly with field service activity. Invite the audience to comment on how they are applying that information in their ministry.</p>

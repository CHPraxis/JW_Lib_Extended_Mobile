Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the Bible Teach book. June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Family Happiness book. July: What Does the Bible Really Teach? When householders already have this publication, use an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.
▪ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a Pioneer Appointment Letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. If they do not, please inform the branch office in writing.
▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2006 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. If the congregation needs additional badge cards, these should be requested on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Plastic badge card holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.
▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These may be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Before sending regular pioneer application forms to the branch, make sure they are completely filled out.
▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and promptly forward a Presiding Overseer/​Secretary Change of Address (S-29) form to the branch office. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.

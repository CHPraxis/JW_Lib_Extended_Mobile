“It Is Marvelous”
That is what a couple in Georgia, U.S.A., wrote regarding What Does the Bible Really Teach? a colorfully illustrated, 224-page book published in 2005. They explained: “It is simple enough that almost anyone can use it. Yet, it has enough depth to satisfy the spiritual need of the most learned.”
The title itself has attracted interest, as illustrated by what happened to a couple from New Jersey, U.S.A. After attending a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Florida, where they obtained a copy of the book, the couple flew to the Bahamas for a vacation. While examining their luggage, a customs official noticed the book, read the title, and said, “I have always wanted to know the answer to that question.” Much to the official’s delight, the Witness couple gave her a spare copy.
The following day the same couple were reading the book at the beach when a local woman selling goods to tourists noticed it. She explained that earlier that day she had prayed to God for an answer to basically that same question—What does the Bible really teach? She asked how she could get a copy of the book and was overjoyed when the vacationers gave her their remaining extra copy.

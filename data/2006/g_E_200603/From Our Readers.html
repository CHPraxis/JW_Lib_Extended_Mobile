<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Skin Cancer<wbr />—How to Protect Yourself </strong>(June 8, 2005)  The information in this series is excellent. I am a chief physician at a dermatology clinic. I would like to receive some extra copies so that I can distribute them.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thanks to this article, I decided to have a growth on my back checked. The doctor told me that it could have turned into a form of cancer called Bowen’s disease. I had surgery immediately. This series helped me to take quick action.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The box on page 7 moved me to have a mole examined by my doctor. The diagnosis<wbr />—malignant melanoma in its earliest stage. As the article pointed out, if the melanoma had not been treated early, it could have been fatal. I am grateful to my doctor and to this <em>Awake! </em>series, which just may have saved my life!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>For Family Review </strong>(May 8, 2005)  I used to read only the articles that appealed to me, but after seeing “For Family Review,” I read the whole magazine so that I could answer the questions. It wasn’t long before reading the entire magazine became a habit!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Young People Ask . . . Why </strong><strong>Am</strong> <strong>I Drawn to the Wrong People? </strong>(July 22, 2005)  It seems that after ten years of “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” I still did not know how to fix this flaw in my character. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>) I realized that I was not being emotionally mature, but I did not know how to address the problem. I thank Jehovah for articles like this, which help us to function in this present system.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In this article mention is made of ‘not completely shunning those who are unacquainted with Bible truths.’ Could you explain more on this? What if a Christian is pursuing a close relationship with a nonbeliever? Should this not be a cause for concern?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si"><strong><em>“Awake!” responds: </em></strong>The article was not encouraging Christians to pursue close relationships with nonbelievers. Really, in any circumstance the Bible principle applies: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) This does not mean, though, that we completely shun nonbelievers. As pointed out in the article, the Bible urges us to “work what is good toward all”<wbr />—not just toward those who share our faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10</a>) Indeed, the very nature of our Christian ministry requires that we take genuine interest in people, treating them with dignity and respect. Jesus set a fine example in this regard. In no way did he forge close bonds with those who had no interest in doing God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:14-43:15:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 15:14</a>) At the same time, he approached people and knew how to converse with them and relate to them. As a result, Jesus had opportunity to give an effective witness. (See, for example, the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:7:36-42:7:50" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 7:36-50</a>.) Like Jesus, we can maintain a respectful attitude toward nonbelievers. Our aim is “to be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:3:2-56:3:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Titus 3:2</a>.</p>

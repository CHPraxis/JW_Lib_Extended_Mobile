“Why Are We Here?”
NOBEL Prize winner and Nazi Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel once called it “the most important question a human being has to face.” What is it? The question, “Why are we here?”
Have you ever pondered that question? Many have, but the answer eludes them. In his attempt to identify life’s meaning, British historian Arnold Toynbee wrote: “Man’s true end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever.”
Interestingly, over three millenniums ago, another man, who was noted for being a keen observer of life, had already identified the fundamental answer. Wise King Solomon said: “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.”​—Ecclesiastes 12:13.
This basic principle was supported by God’s Son, Jesus Christ. While on earth, Jesus made every effort to glorify his heavenly Father. Serving his Creator enriched Jesus’ life. It nourished and sustained him, enabling him to say: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me.”​—John 4:34.
So why are we here? Like Jesus, Solomon, and many other servants of God, we can find true meaning and lasting happiness in life by doing God’s will. Would you like to know more about how to worship God “with spirit and truth”? (John 4:24) Jehovah’s Witnesses in your community will be happy to help you to answer the question, “Why are we here?”

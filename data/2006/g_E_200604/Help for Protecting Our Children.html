<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year a woman in Virginia, U.S.A., wrote to express appreciation for the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher, </em>saying: “Before my grandsons go to bed, they say: ‘Nanny, read us a story from the Jesus book.’ Their ages are 4, 6, and 7, and they enjoy the stories very much.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The grandmother explained: “I read chapter 32 entitled ‘How Jesus Was Protected.’ I was really impressed because after talking about how Jehovah protected Jesus, the lesson helps young ones to protect themselves by giving them practical advice. It says: ‘If someone tries to do this, say firmly in a loud voice: <em>“Stop that! I’m going to tell on you!”’”</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Mexico a mother of a five-year–old girl named Betsaida said that she has been reading through the <em>Teacher </em>book with her daughter for the second time. The mother noted: “The world is becoming more decadent, and our little ones face ever more pressures. My daughter says that she is grateful for the instruction on how to protect herself from improper influences, such as those mentioned in chapter 32.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This beautifully illustrated 256-page book, the same page size as this magazine, has proved to be a real help to parents in following the Bible direction to train their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>) The lessons, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, are told in simple language; yet, the subject material is for all age groups. You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

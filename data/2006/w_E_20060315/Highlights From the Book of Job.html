<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Job</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE patriarch Job resides in the land of Uz, now in Arabia. A large number of Israelites live in Egypt at the time. Though not an Israelite himself, Job is a worshipper of Jehovah God. Concerning him, the Bible says: “There is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) This must be the period between the lives of two outstanding servants of Jehovah​—Jacob’s son Joseph and the prophet Moses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Moses, who is thought to have written the book of Job, probably learned about Job when he spent 40 years in Midian, which is near the land of Uz. Moses could have heard about Job’s final years when the Israelites were near Uz, toward the end of their 40-year sojourn in the wilderness.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Job’s experience is so beautifully set out in written form that the account is considered to be a literary masterpiece. More than that, though, it answers such questions as: Why do good people suffer? Why does Jehovah permit wickedness to exist? Can imperfect humans maintain their integrity to God? As a part of the inspired Word of God, the message of the book of Job is alive and exerts power even today.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">One day Satan challenges Job’s integrity before God. Jehovah accepts the challenge and allows Satan to bring upon Job one calamity after another. But Job refuses to “curse God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:9-18:2:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Job’s three companions arrive to “sympathize with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 2:11</a>) They sit with him without speaking a word until Job breaks the silence by saying: “Let the day perish on which I came to be born.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:3-18:3:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 3:3</a>) He wishes to be “like children that have seen no light,” or who were stillborn.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:11-18:3:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 3:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:16-18:3:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

The original-language words for “day” and “birthday” are different, each having its own meaning.

The seven sons of Job apparently held a seven-day family gathering once a year. As they made the circuit, each son was the host of the banquet held at his house on “his own day.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-12</a>) By permitting them to enter before him, Jehovah brought <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>before all spirit creatures Satan’s challenge and the issues it raised.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The basic point that Job’s three companions make in their speeches is that Job must have done something very bad to receive such severe punishment from God. Eliphaz takes the lead. Bildad follows Eliphaz, using language that is more biting. Zophar is even more scathing.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Job does not accept the false reasoning of his visitors. Unable to understand why God has permitted his suffering, he becomes overly concerned about justifying himself. Still, Job loves God and exclaims: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p>

What, then, did he mean? One possibility is that if he should die, none of his contemporaries would see him. From their standpoint, he would neither return to his house nor get further acknowledgment until God’s appointed time. Job might also have meant that no one can come back from Sheol on his own.

It reminds us that our problems will not last forever. “You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="63-1" class="b">James 5:11</a>. Jehovah rewarded Job for being an integrity keeper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:10-18:42:17" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>) What a grand hope is set before us​—everlasting life in Paradise on earth! Like Job, let us therefore be determined to maintain our integrity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>.</p>

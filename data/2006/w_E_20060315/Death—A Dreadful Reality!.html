<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“FROM the moment of birth there is the constant possibility that a human being may die at any moment,” wrote British historian Arnold Toynbee. He added: “And inevitably this possibility is going to become an accomplished fact.” What grief death brings upon us when it strikes a beloved family member or a close friend!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Death has been a dreadful reality for mankind for millenniums. A feeling of helplessness engulfs us when someone dear to us dies. This sadness strikes indiscriminately. It spares no one. “Sorrow makes us all children again​—destroys all differences of intellect. The wisest knows nothing.” So wrote a 19th-century essayist. We become like little children​—helpless, unable to alter the situation. Neither riches nor power can reverse the loss. The wise and intellectual are without answers. Strong ones weep, as do the weak.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">King David of ancient Israel experienced such anguish when his son Absalom died. Upon hearing the news of his death, the king gave way to weeping and exclaimed: “My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I might have died, I myself, instead of you, Absalom my son, my son!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:33-10:18:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 18:33</a>) A mighty king who had subdued powerful enemies could do nothing but helplessly wish that he himself had surrendered to “the last enemy, death,” in place of his son.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>.</p>

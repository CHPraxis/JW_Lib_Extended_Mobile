<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IN 1473 B.C.E., the nation of Israel was poised to enter the Promised Land. Regarding the challenges ahead, Moses reminded the people: “You are today crossing the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified to the heavens, a people great and tall, the sons of Anakim, about whom you yourself have . . . heard it said, ‘Who can make a firm stand before the sons of Anak?’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:9:1-5:9:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 9:1, 2</a>) Yes, these giant warriors were proverbial!

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Israel, on the other hand, had been a nation of slaves and had just spent 40 years in the wilderness. Hence, from a human point of view, their chances of being victorious would seem remote. Yet, Moses had faith; he could ‘see’ Jehovah leading them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:27-58:11:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:27</a>) “Jehovah your God is crossing before you,” Moses told the people. “He will annihilate them, and he himself will subdue them before you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:9:3-5:9:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 9:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:33:16-19:33:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Psalm 33:16, 17</a>) After Moses’ death, Jehovah reassured Joshua of His backing, saying: “Get up, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. Nobody will take a firm stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I proved to be with Moses I shall prove to be with you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:2-6:1:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joshua 1:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:5-6:1:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>To have Jehovah’s support and guidance, Joshua must read and meditate on God’s Law and live by it. “Then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely,” said Jehovah. “Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and strong. Do not suffer shock or be terrified, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8, 9</a>) Because Joshua listened to God, he proved to be courageous, strong, and successful. Most of his generation, however, did not listen. As a result, they were not successful, and they died in the wilderness.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Forty years earlier when Israel first approached Canaan, Moses sent 12 men to spy out the land. Ten returned fearful. “All the people whom we saw in the midst of it are men of extraordinary size,” they cried. “There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who are from the Nephilim; so that we became in our own eyes like grasshoppers.” Were “all the people”<wbr />—not just the Anakim—<wbr />giants? No. Were the Anakim descendants of the pre-Flood Nephilim? Of course not! Still, because of these distortions, a wave of fear spread through the camp. The people even wanted to return to Egypt, the land of their slavery!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:13:31-4:14:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 13:31–14:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, however, were eager to enter the Promised Land. <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>The Canaanites “are bread to us,” they said. “Their shelter has turned away from over them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:9-4:14:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 14:9</a>) Were Joshua and Caleb being foolishly optimistic? By no means! Along with the rest of the nation, they had seen Jehovah humiliate mighty Egypt and its gods by means of the Ten Plagues. Then they saw Jehovah drown Pharaoh and his military force in the Red Sea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:136:15-19:136:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 136:15</a>) Clearly, the fear shown by the ten spies and those who were influenced by them was inexcusable. “How long will they not put faith in me for all the signs that I performed in among them?” said Jehovah, expressing his deep hurt.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:11-4:14:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Numbers 14:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 6. In what way is courage related to faith, and how is this seen in modern times?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah went right to the heart of the problem<wbr />—the cowardly attitude of the people betrayed their lack of faith. Yes, faith and courage are intimately related, so much so that the apostle John could write concerning the Christian congregation and its spiritual warfare: “This is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:4-62:5:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>) Today, faith like that of Joshua and Caleb has resulted in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom worldwide by over six million Witnesses of Jehovah, young and old, strong and frail. No enemy has been able to silence this mighty, courageous army.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:31-45:8:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 8:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Do Not “Shrink Back”</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7. What does it mean to “shrink back”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jehovah’s servants today courageously preach the good news because they are of the same mind as the apostle Paul, who wrote: “We are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:39-58:10:39" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:39</a>) To “shrink back,” as Paul mentioned, does not mean just to experience a temporary bout of fear, for many faithful servants of God have at times been afraid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:21:12-9:21:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:19:1-11:19:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 19:1-4</a>) Rather, it means “to draw back, withdraw,” to be “remiss in holding the truth,” explains one Bible dictionary. It adds that “shrink back” may be a metaphor based on “lowering a sail and so slackening the course” in regard to God’s service. Of course, those with strong faith give no consideration to “slackening the course” when difficulty arises<wbr />—be it persecution, ill health, or some other trial. Instead, they press on in serving Jehovah, aware that he deeply cares for them and knows their limitations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 103:14</a>) Do you have that kind of faith?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 2:1-4</a>) Their faith strengthened, the disciples embarked on a preaching campaign that despite opposition took the good news to “all creation that is under heaven.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Colossians 1:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Acts 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:28:22-44:28:22" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 28:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In order to build our faith and to press on in our ministry, we too must study and meditate on the Scriptures and pray for holy spirit. Only by impressing God’s truth on our mind and heart<wbr />—as Joshua, Caleb, and the early Christian disciples did—<wbr />will we have faith that gives us the courage needed to endure in our spiritual warfare and to come off victorious.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 10:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>As demonstrated by integrity-keepers of old, faith that leads to courage and endurance embraces more than mere belief in God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:19-59:2:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">James 2:19</a>) It requires that we come to know Jehovah as a person and have full confidence in him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>) Faith also involves having full assurance that Jehovah will fulfill all his promises and become “the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Isaiah 55:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Such faith is not static.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>A Man Who “Pleased God Well”</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13, 14. Why did Enoch need faith and courage?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>We can learn much about faith and courage by considering the example set by another pre-Christian witness<wbr />—Enoch. Even before he commenced prophesying, Enoch likely knew that his faith and courage would be put to the test. How so? Because Jehovah had stated in Eden that enmity, or hatred, would exist between those who serve God and those who serve Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>) Enoch also knew that this hatred had erupted early in human history when Cain murdered his brother Abel. Indeed, their father, Adam, lived for nearly 310 years after Enoch was born.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:5:3-1:5:18" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Genesis 5:3-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Despite these facts, however, Enoch courageously “went on walking with the true God” and condemned “the shocking things” that people said against Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:5:22-1:5:22" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Genesis 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/65:1:14-65:1:15" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Jude 14, 15</a>) This fearless stand for true worship apparently made Enoch many enemies, putting his life in danger. In this instance, Jehovah spared his prophet the pangs of death. After revealing to Enoch “that he had pleased God well,” Jehovah “transferred” him from life to death, perhaps during a prophetic trance.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:5-58:11:5" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:13-58:11:13" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:5:24-1:5:24" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> Genesis 5:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. What fine example did Enoch set for Jehovah’s servants today?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Immediately after mentioning Enoch’s transference, Paul again stressed the importance of faith, saying: “Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please [God] well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) Yes, having faith gave Enoch the courage to walk with Jehovah and to proclaim His judgment message to a godless world. In this, Enoch set a fine example for us. We have a similar work to do in a world that is opposed to true worship and that is filled with every form of badness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:92:7-19:92:7" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 92:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> Revelation 12:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Besides faith, there is another quality that contributes to courage, namely the reverential fear of God. Let us consider an outstanding example of a God-fearing man who lived in the days of the prophet Elijah and of King Ahab, who ruled over the northern kingdom of Israel. During Ahab’s rule, Baal worship infected the northern kingdom on an unprecedented scale. In fact, 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the sacred pole, <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>were “eating at the table of Jezebel,” Ahab’s wife.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:16:30-11:16:33" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Kings 16:30-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:19-11:18:19" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 18:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>A ruthless enemy of Jehovah, Jezebel tried to eradicate true worship from the land. She murdered some of Jehovah’s prophets and even tried to kill Elijah, who at God’s direction escaped by fleeing across the Jordan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:17:1-11:17:3" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:13-11:18:13" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 18:13</a>) Can you imagine how difficult it would have been to uphold pure worship in the northern kingdom back then? Worse still, what if you worked in the royal palace itself? That was the situation in which God-fearing Obadiah,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Ahab’s household steward, found himself.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:3-11:18:3" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">18. What made Obadiah exceptional as a worshipper of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Undoubtedly, Obadiah was both cautious and discreet in his worship of Jehovah. Still, he did not compromise. In fact, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:3-11:18:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:3</a> tells us: “Obadiah himself had proved to be one <em>greatly fearing </em>Jehovah.” Yes, Obadiah’s fear of God was exceptional! This wholesome fear, in turn, gave him outstanding courage, as was demonstrated immediately after Jezebel murdered Jehovah’s prophets.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">19. What did Obadiah do that demonstrated his courage?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>We read: “It came about that when Jezebel cut off Jehovah’s prophets, Obadiah proceeded to take a hundred prophets and keep them hid by fifties in a cave, and he supplied them bread and water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:18:4-11:18:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 Kings 18:4</a>) As you can imagine, secretly feeding a hundred men was a very dangerous undertaking. Not only did Obadiah have to avoid getting caught by Ahab and Jezebel but he also had to avoid detection by the 850 false prophets who frequented the palace. Besides that, the many other false worshippers in the land, from peasants to princes, would no doubt have seized any opportunity to expose Obadiah so as to curry favor with the king and queen. Nevertheless, right under the noses of all these idolaters, Obadiah courageously attended to the needs of Jehovah’s prophets. How powerful the fear of God can be!</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20. How did Obadiah’s godly fear help him, and how does his example help you?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Because Obadiah demonstrated courage through godly fear, Jehovah evidently shielded him from his enemies. Says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>: “Trembling at men is what lays a snare, but he that is trusting in Jehovah will be protected.” Obadiah was not superhuman; he was afraid of getting caught and killed, just as we would be.

Obadiah is a fine example for all of us, especially for those who worship Jehovah at the risk of their freedom or even their life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Matthew 24:9</a>) Yes, may all of us strive to serve Jehovah “with godly fear and awe.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:28-58:12:28" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:28</a>.</p>

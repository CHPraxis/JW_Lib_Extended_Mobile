God Invites You to Benefit From His Wisdom
“I, Jehovah, am . . . teaching you to benefit yourself, the One guiding you in the way you should walk. If only you would pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.”​—ISAIAH 48:17, 18.
Consider those words as a personal invitation from God. He wants you to have inner peace and lasting happiness, and he can help you to find them.
God’s Wisdom Is Available to You
“In all the nations, the good news has to be preached.”​—MARK 13:10.
The “good news” includes Jehovah’s promises to end suffering, to make the earth a paradise, and to bring our dead loved ones back to life. Jehovah’s Witnesses are preaching that Bible-based message worldwide.

My Confusion Went Away When I Read the Bible
“From a very young age, I was confused about who the Creator is. I wondered, ‘How could each nation rightly have its own god or creator?’ So I love what the Bible says at Romans 3:29 that the true God is ‘the God of people of the nations.’ He also has a personal name​—Jehovah—​and he wants us to be his friends.”​—Rakesh.

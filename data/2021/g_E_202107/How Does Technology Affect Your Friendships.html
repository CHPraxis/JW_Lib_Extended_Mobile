<h3 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>EMPATHY</strong></h3>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Empathy requires that we slow down and patiently consider another person​—something that may seem difficult to achieve with an overload of social media posts and rapid-fire texting.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In time, if technology is controlling you, responding to your friends’ messages can seem like another chore on your to-do list. Your goal becomes to clear out your in-box rather than to help a friend in need.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>How can you maintain “fellow feeling” when you use technology to communicate with friends?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 PETER 3:8</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>EMPTINESS</strong></h3>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">One study found that many people felt worse after browsing through a popular social media platform. The researchers concluded that looking at the pictures and updates of others can leave a person with “a feeling of not having done anything meaningful.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Furthermore, looking at the exciting photos others have posted can lead to negative comparisons. After all, it may seem as if everyone else were having a good time, while your own life is in a rut.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>When using social media, how can you avoid negatively comparing yourself with others?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">GALATIANS 6:4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>SELF-FOCUS</strong></h3>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">One teacher notes that some of her students seem inclined toward one-sided friendships in which their greatest concern is, “Who has my back?”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Such friendships focus merely on what one gets out of the relationship. A person could start to view his friends as apps that can be used and shut off as needed.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>Does what you post online show that you may have the tendency to be competitive or to focus too much on yourself?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">GALATIANS 5:26</a>.</p>

<h3 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>DEPENDENCY</strong></h3>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Some online activities​—gaming, for example—​tend to be highly addictive. That is no accident. “The apps on our phones are designed to keep us at our phones,” says the book <em>Reclaiming Conversation. </em>The longer we stare at commercial apps on our screens, the more profitable we become to advertisers.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>Do your children seem overly attached to their devices? How can you help them make better use of their time?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">EPHESIANS 5:15, 16</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>CYBERBULLYING</strong></h3>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When online, some people become more aggressive, vulgar, and insensitive to others’ feelings​—traits that can lead to bullying.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Some misuses of social media can be related to a person’s inordinate desire to be liked or followed. Or if a person finds out he was not included in some way​—for example, he sees he was not invited to a party—​this could make him feel as if he were being bullied.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>Do your children use proper manners online? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31</a>) How well do they deal with feeling excluded?</p>
<h3 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>PORNOGRAPHY</strong></h3>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The Internet has made lewd content easily available and accessible. Parents should realize that while filters can help, they are not foolproof.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Sexting​—sending or receiving explicit personal images, usually via smartphone—​can have legal consequences. In some cases, depending on local laws and the ages of those involved, people who sext can be charged with spreading child pornography.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>How can you help your children resist the temptation to view or send sexually explicit images online?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">EPHESIANS 5:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Although “digital natives” may use technology with remarkable ease, they still need guidance. The book <em>Indistractable </em>notes that giving children a smartphone or other device before they have the skills to use it properly is “just as irresponsible as letting them jump headfirst into a pool without knowing how to swim.”</p>

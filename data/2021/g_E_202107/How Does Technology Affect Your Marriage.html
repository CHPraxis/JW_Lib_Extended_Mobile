<h3 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>TIME TOGETHER</strong></h3>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A husband named Michael says: “Sometimes when my wife and I are together, she isn’t really ‘there.’ She’s busy looking at her phone, and she says, ‘I haven’t been able to check until now.’” A husband named Jonathan says that in such situations “spouses can be physically together and yet seem miles apart.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>TO THINK ABOUT: </strong>How often does a phone call, text, or notification interfere with quality time that could be spent with your spouse?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">EPHESIANS 5:33</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>WORK</strong></h3>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Some people have to be available around the clock because of the nature of their secular work. Others, whose jobs are not so demanding, still find it difficult to leave their job behind them at the end of the day. “It’s hard not to check every phone call or text message that I receive for work during time that I’ve set aside to spend with my wife,” admits a husband named Lee. A wife named Joy says: “I work from home, so work is always present. It takes effort to be balanced.”</p>

<h3 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>LOYALTY</strong></h3>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">One poll found that suspicious use of social media was a common cause of marital fights. Ten percent of those surveyed admitted posting material online that they keep hidden from their spouse.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">For good reason, social media has been called a “marriage minefield” and even “an adultery service.” Not surprisingly, divorce lawyers say that social media plays a significant role in many of today’s marriage breakups.</p>

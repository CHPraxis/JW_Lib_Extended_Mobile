APPLY YOURSELF TO THE FIELD MINISTRY | INCREASE YOUR JOY IN THE MINISTRY
Accept Help From Fellow Workers




To help us, Jehovah has provided us with “the entire association” of our brothers and sisters. (1Pe 5:9) They can assist us to face challenges in the ministry with success. For instance, the apostle Paul benefited from the help of Aquila and Priscilla, Silas, Timothy, and others.​—Ac 18:1-5.
How can fellow workers assist you in the ministry? They might give you practical suggestions on how to overcome objections, to make return visits, or to offer and conduct Bible studies. Think of someone in your congregation who could provide the help you need, and then ask for it. No doubt you both will find it beneficial, and you will contribute to each other’s joy.​—Php 1:25.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Keep Jehovah Constantly in Mind




When secular work is hard to find, we may struggle to keep the Kingdom and God’s righteousness first in our life. We may be tempted to accept work that hinders our service to Jehovah or violates Bible principles. However, we can be certain that Jehovah shows his strength “in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (2Ch 16:9) Nothing can prevent our loving Father from helping us and providing what we need. (Ro 8:32) Therefore, when making decisions about work, we must trust in Jehovah and keep our life focused on service to him.​—Ps 16:8.

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Blesses Acts of Faith




Jehovah’s direction may seem unwise from a human standpoint (Jos 3:12, 13; it-2 105; see cover picture)
Appointed men should take the lead in following instructions (Jos 3:14; w13 9/15 16 ¶17)
Jehovah blesses decisive action (Jos 3:15-17; w13 9/15 16 ¶18)





We give Jehovah something to bless when we take the initiative to preach, even if we are limited by health or circumstances.

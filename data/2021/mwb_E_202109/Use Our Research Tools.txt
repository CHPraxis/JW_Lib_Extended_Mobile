Use Our Research Tools




Jehovah gives us tools to teach skillfully, such as videos, tracts, magazines, brochures, books, and our primary tool, the Bible. (2Ti 3:16) He also provides research tools that can assist us to explain the Scriptures. These include the Watchtower Library, the JW Library® app, the Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™, and the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses.
You will experience joy as you dig for spiritual treasures in the wealth of information available to you. Be sure to train your students how to use the tools. Then they too will find delight in discovering answers to their own Bible questions.

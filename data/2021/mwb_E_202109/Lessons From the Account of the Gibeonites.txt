TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Lessons From the Account of the Gibeonites




The Gibeonites showed practical wisdom (Jos 9:3-6; it-1 930-931)
The elders of Israel unwisely did not consult with Jehovah (Jos 9:14, 15; w11 11/15 8 ¶14)
The Gibeonites humbly served the Israelites (Jos 9:25-27; w04 10/15 18 ¶14)
The Gibeonites performed humble tasks because they wanted to gain Jehovah’s favor. How might we show similar humility today?

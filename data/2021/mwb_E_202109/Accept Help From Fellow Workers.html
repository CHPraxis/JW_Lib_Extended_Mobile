(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Pe 5:9</a>) They can assist us to face challenges in the ministry with success.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can fellow workers assist you in the ministry? They might give you practical suggestions on how to overcome objections, to make return visits, or to offer and conduct Bible studies. Think of someone in your congregation who could provide the help you need, and then ask for it. No doubt you both will find it beneficial, and you will contribute to each other’s joy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:25-50:1:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Php 1:25</a>.</p>

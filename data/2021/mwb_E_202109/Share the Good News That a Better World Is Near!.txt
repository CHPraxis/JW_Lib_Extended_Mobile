LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Share the Good News That a Better World Is Near!




During November, we will make a special effort to share the good news that a better world is near. (Ps 37:10, 11; Re 21:3-5) Adjust your schedule to share fully in this campaign. If you sign up to serve as an auxiliary pioneer for the month, you may choose a 30- or 50-hour requirement.
Prepare to share a scripture regarding the new world with as many people as possible. When selecting a Bible verse, consider what would appeal to people in your territory. If someone expresses interest on the initial call, give him a copy of the public edition of The Watchtower No. 2 2021. Then, follow up on interest as soon as possible and try to start a Bible study using the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. What a joy to be fully occupied in sharing “good news of something better”!​—Isa 52:7.
For an option of how to present the message, watch the video Initial Call: Good News​—Ps 37:10, 11


WATCH THE ORIGINAL SONG VIDEO THE NEW WORLD TO COME, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:

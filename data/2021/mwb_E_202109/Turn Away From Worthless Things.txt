TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Turn Away From Worthless Things




Achan’s eyes led him to take what did not belong to him (Jos 7:1, 20, 21; w10 4/15 20 ¶5)
Achan’s actions affected his family and the whole nation of Israel (Jos 7:4, 5, 24-26; w97 8/15 28 ¶2)
We must exercise self-discipline (1Jo 2:15-17; w10 4/15 21 ¶8)
We must reject worthless things that will not exist in God’s new world of righteousness.​—2Pe 3:13.

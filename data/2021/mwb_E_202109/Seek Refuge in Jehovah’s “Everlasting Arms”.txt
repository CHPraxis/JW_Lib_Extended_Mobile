TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Seek Refuge in Jehovah’s “Everlasting Arms”




Jehovah wants us to remain morally upright (De 33:26; it-2 51)
Jehovah willingly uses his strength in our behalf (De 33:27; rr 120, box)
We should trust in Jehovah’s salvation as Moses did (De 33:29; w11 9/15 19 ¶16)
Jehovah’s everlasting arms support us during various trials. This includes when we are sick or depressed, face grief, or make mistakes but repent.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Keep Training Your Powers of Discernment




An athlete must continue to train his muscles in order to remain skilled. Similarly, we must put forth repeated effort to train and to maintain our powers of discernment. (Heb 5:14) Although we may be inclined simply to copy the decisions of others, we must exercise our own thinking ability and decide for ourselves. Why? Each of us will render an account for our own decisions.​—Ro 14:12.
We should not assume that we will make good decisions simply because we have been baptized for many years. To make wise decisions, we need to rely fully on Jehovah, his Word, and his organization.​—Jos 1:7, 8; Pr 3:5, 6; Mt 24:45.

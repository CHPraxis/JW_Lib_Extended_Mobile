TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Fights for Israel




Five kings joined forces against Gibeon and Israel (Jos 10:5; it-1 50)
Jehovah fought against the coalition (Jos 10:10, 11; it-1 1020)
Jehovah caused the sun to stand still (Jos 10:12-14; w04 12/1 11 ¶1)





When we face persecution, we trust in Jehovah to help us remain faithful. We know that with his backing, no human government can prevent us from worshipping him.

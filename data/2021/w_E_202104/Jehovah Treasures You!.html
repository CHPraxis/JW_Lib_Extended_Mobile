<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD “takes pleasure in his people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:149:4-19:149:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 149:4</a>) What a delightful thought that is!

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Like the faithful Christians just mentioned, you love Jehovah deeply but may doubt that he loves you. Why do you need to be convinced that he truly cares for you? And what can help you to cope when you are gripped by negative thinking? Let us consider the answers to these questions.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><strong>DOUBTING JEHOVAH’S LOVE IS DANGEROUS</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why is it dangerous to doubt Jehovah’s love for us?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Love is a powerful motivating force. If we are convinced of Jehovah’s love and support, we will be impelled to serve him wholeheartedly in spite of life’s challenges. On the other hand, if we doubt that God cares for us, our “strength will be meager.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 24:10</a>) And when we become discouraged and lose faith in God’s love, we will be vulnerable to Satan’s attacks.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:16-49:6:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What effect has doubting God’s love had on some?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Some faithful Christians in our time have been weakened spiritually by doubts. An elder named James says: “Even though I was serving at Bethel and was enjoying my ministry in a foreign-language congregation, I wondered if Jehovah was really accepting my sacrifices. At one point, I even questioned whether Jehovah was listening to my prayers.” Eva, who is also in full-time service, says: “I found that doubting Jehovah’s love is dangerous because doing so sends you into a downward spiral. This affects your appetite for spiritual things and undermines your joy in serving Jehovah.” Michael, a regular pioneer and an elder, says: “If you don’t believe that God cares for you, you will drift away from him.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What must we do when doubts about God’s love enter our mind?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>These experiences illustrate just how spiritually harmful negative thinking can be. But what should we do when doubts about God’s love find their way into our mind? We must immediately reject them! Ask Jehovah to help you replace those “disquieting thoughts” with ‘the peace of God that will guard your heart and your mental powers.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:23-19:139:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 139:23</a>; ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) And remember, you are not alone. Other faithful brothers and sisters are struggling with negative feelings. Even servants of Jehovah in the past had to deal with such challenges. Consider what we can learn from the example of the apostle Paul.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What problems did Paul face?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Do you sometimes feel weighed down by many responsibilities, unable to cope with them all? If so, you would understand Paul. He felt anxiety, not just for one congregation but “for all the congregations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:23-47:11:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:23-28</a>) Do chronic health problems often rob you of your joy? Paul was afflicted by a persistent “thorn in the flesh,” which may have been a physical ailment, and he was desperate to be rid of it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:7-47:12:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-10</a>) Are you discouraged by your own imperfections? So was Paul at times. He called himself a “miserable man” because of his relentless battle with his own imperfections.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What helped Paul cope with his problems?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Despite facing various tests and discouraging circumstances, Paul kept on serving Jehovah. What gave him the strength to do so? Although he was keenly aware of his imperfections, he had unwavering faith in the ransom. He was familiar with Jesus’ promise that <strong><em>“everyone </em></strong>exercising faith in [Jesus] might . . . have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>) Paul certainly was among those who were exercising faith in the ransom. He was convinced that Jehovah is ready to forgive even those who have sinned seriously if they are repentant.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What do we learn from Paul’s words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Galatians 2:20</a>?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Paul also had faith in the power of God’s love as expressed by Christ. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Galatians 2:20</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Notice the reassuring words at the end of that verse. Paul said: “The Son of God . . . loved <strong><em>me </em></strong>and handed himself over for <strong><em>me.” </em></strong>Paul did not put a limit on God’s love, as if to say, ‘I can see why Jehovah would love my brothers, but he could not possibly love me.’ Paul reminded the Romans: “While we were yet sinners, Christ died for <strong><em>us.” </em></strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 5:8</a>) God’s love knows no boundaries!</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What do we learn from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 8:38, 39</a>?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 8:38, 39</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Paul was absolutely convinced of the power of God’s love. He wrote that nothing “will be able to separate us from God’s love.” Paul knew how Jehovah had patiently <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>dealt with the nation of Israel. He also knew how Jehovah had shown mercy to him. We might sum up Paul’s reasoning this way, ‘Since Jehovah sent his own Son to die for <strong><em>me, </em></strong>do I have any reason to doubt his love?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:32-45:8:32" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rom. 8:32</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:12-15</strong></a><strong>. </strong>There must have been times when Paul was tormented by his past. He referred to himself as the “foremost” sinner, and no wonder! Before coming to a knowledge of the truth, Paul relentlessly pursued Christians in one city after another, putting some in prison and voting for the execution of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:10-44:26:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 26:10, 11</a>) Can you imagine how Paul would have felt on meeting a young Christian whose parents had been executed with his approval? Paul regretted his mistakes, but he knew he could not change the past. He accepted that Christ had died for him, and he confidently wrote: “By God’s undeserved kindness I am what I am.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:3-46:15:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:10-46:15:10" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 10</a>) What is the lesson for us? Accept that Christ died for <strong><em>you </em></strong>and paved the way for you to enter into a warm, personal relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) What counts with God is what we do <strong><em>now </em></strong>and in the <strong><em>future, </em></strong>not the mistakes we made in the <strong><em>past, </em></strong>whether we were one of Jehovah’s Witnesses at the time or not.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How can the words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:20" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 John 3:19, 20</a> help us if we feel worthless or unlovable?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When you think about Jesus’ dying to cover your sins, you may say, ‘I do not feel worthy of that honor.’ Why might you feel that way? Our imperfect <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>heart might deceive us, making us feel worthless or unlovable. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:20" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 3:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>At such times, we need to remember that “God is greater than our hearts.” Our heavenly Father’s love and forgiveness are far stronger than any negative feelings that may lurk in our heart. We need to convince ourselves to accept Jehovah’s view of us. To do that, we must study his Word often, pray to him frequently, and associate regularly with his loyal people. Why is doing those things so important?</p>

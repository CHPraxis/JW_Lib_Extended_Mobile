<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>Why did Jesus ask Jehovah to watch over his disciples?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">ON THE last night of his life as a man, Jesus was thinking about the challenges that his disciples would face. Moved by his love for his friends, Jesus asked his Father to “watch over them because of the wicked one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:14, 15</a>) Jesus knew that after he returned to heaven, Satan the Devil would continue to wage war against any who wanted to serve Jehovah. Clearly, Jehovah’s people would need protection.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>How can we be sure that Jehovah will answer our prayers?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah answered Jesus’ prayer because of His love for His Son. If we try our best to please Jehovah, he will love us too, and he will pay attention to our prayers for help and protection. As a concerned family Head, Jehovah will continue to care lovingly for his children. His very name, or reputation, is at stake!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why do we need Jehovah’s protection today?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We need Jehovah’s protection as never before. Satan has been cast out of heaven, “having great anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 12:12</a>) He has managed to convince some who persecute us that they are offering “a sacred service to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:2-43:16:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 16:2</a>) Others, who do not believe in God, persecute us because we do not fit into this world’s mold. Whatever the case, we can be confident. Why? Because God’s Word says: “The Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the wicked one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:3-53:3:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:3</a>) How does Jehovah protect us? Let us discuss two ways.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah has made available to us a suit of armor that can protect us from Satan’s attacks. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:13-49:6:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 6:13-17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This spiritual armor is strong and effective!

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup><em>The belt of truth </em></strong>represents the truths found in God’s Word, the Bible. Why must we wear this belt? Because Satan is “the father of the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) He has had thousands of years to practice his lying and has misled “the entire inhabited earth”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) But the truths contained in the Bible protect us from being deceived. How do we wear this symbolic belt? We do so by learning the truth about Jehovah, by worshipping him “with spirit and truth,” and by conducting ourselves honestly in all things.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 4:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Heb. 13:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>The breastplate of righteousness </em></strong>represents Jehovah’s righteous standards. Why must we wear the breastplate? Just as a breastplate protects the literal heart of a soldier from being pierced, the breastplate of righteousness protects our figurative heart, or inner person, from the corrupting influences of this world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>) Jehovah expects us to love and serve him with our whole heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:37" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 22:36, 37</a>) So Satan tries to divide our heart by getting us to love the things this world offers​—things that Jehovah hates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:16" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:15, 16</a>) And if that does not work, he will try to bully us into going against Jehovah’s standards.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We wear the breastplate of righteousness by accepting Jehovah’s standards of right and wrong and by living according to those standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10</a>) Some may feel that Jehovah’s standards are restrictive. But if we were to stop applying Bible principles in our lives, we would be like a soldier who removed his breastplate in the middle of a battle because he thought it was too heavy. How foolish that would be! To those who love Jehovah, his commandments are, “not burdensome,” but lifesaving.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What does it mean to have our feet shod in readiness to declare the good news?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Paul also urges us to have our <strong><em>feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace. </em></strong>In other words, we should always be ready to preach the Kingdom good news. When we share the Bible’s message with others, our own faith is strengthened. It is truly encouraging to see how Jehovah’s people around the earth are looking for opportunities to declare the good news​—when at work, at school, in business territory and when preaching from house to house, shopping, visiting unbelieving relatives, talking to casual acquaintances, and even when confined at home for a time. If we were to give in to fear and stop preaching, we would be like a soldier who <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>removed his sandals during the battle; his feet would easily get injured. As a result, he would be more vulnerable to attack, and he would not be able to follow the orders of his commander.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup><em>The large shield of faith </em></strong>represents the faith we have in Jehovah. We trust that he will fulfill all his promises. That faith will help us “to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows.” Why do we need to carry this large shield? Because it protects us from being swayed by the teachings of apostates or from being intimidated by the snide remarks of cynics. Without faith, we will not have the strength to resist when others try to persuade us to ignore Jehovah’s standards. On the other hand, each time we stand up for our faith at work or at school, we are carrying our shield. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) Each time we turn down a better-paying job that would interfere with our routine of worship, we are carrying our shield. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) And each time we serve Jehovah despite opposition, we are being protected by our shield.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:2-52:2:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:2</a>.</p>

In what way? That hope keeps us focused on God’s promises and helps us to see problems in the right perspective. How do we wear this helmet? We do so by keeping our thinking in harmony with God’s thoughts.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>An experienced soldier knows that he cannot successfully fight a massive army on his own; he needs the help of his fellow soldiers. Similarly, we cannot successfully resist Satan and his followers on our own; we need the support of our brothers and sisters.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>One way we receive support is by attending our meetings. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When we feel discouraged​—as we all do at times—​meetings can lift our spirits. We are encouraged by the heartfelt comments given by our brothers and sisters. The Bible-based talks and demonstrations that they present strengthen our determination to serve Jehovah. And our upbuilding conversations before and after the meeting encourage us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) In addition, our meetings give us the opportunity to have the joy that comes from helping others.

They improve our battle skills, so to speak, by equipping us for the ministry. For example, we learn to use the tools in our Teaching Toolbox effectively. So prepare well for congregation meetings. During the meeting, listen carefully. After the meeting, apply the training you received. By doing such things, you will become “a fine soldier of Christ Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:3-55:2:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:3</a>.</p>

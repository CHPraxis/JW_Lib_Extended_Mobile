<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">ARE you suffering through a difficult trial? Perhaps someone in the congregation has hurt you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) Or maybe your workmates or schoolmates ridicule you for serving Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:3-60:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:3, 4</a>) Or family members are possibly trying to stop you from attending meetings or from talking to others about your faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:35-40:10:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:35, 36</a>) If a trial is especially painful, you may feel like giving up. But you can be confident that no matter what challenge you face, Jehovah will give you the wisdom to deal with it and the strength to endure it.</p>

It helps you to connect thoughts and gain a deeper understanding of a subject. Reading the Bible without meditation is like looking at pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on a table without assembling them. Meditation is like putting those pieces together so that you can see the whole picture. To help you meditate, you could ask and answer such questions as these: ‘What did the key character in the account do to help himself? How did Jehovah help him? How can I use the lessons I have learned to help me endure trials?’</p>

He works hard, but he is wasting his effort. Why? Because when a storm and flood hit his house, it will collapse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 7:24-27</a>) Similarly, if we pray, imagine, and meditate but we do not apply what we learn, we will have wasted our effort. When our faith is tested by trials or persecution, it will not be strong enough. On the other hand, when we study and apply what we learn, we make better decisions, we gain more peace, and we develop stronger faith.

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What Bible account will we now consider?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Has a friend or a family member betrayed your trust? If so, you would benefit by reviewing the account of King David’s son Absalom, who betrayed his father and tried to steal the kingdom from him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:5-10:15:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:5-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:31-10:15:31" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:6-10:18:14" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 18:6-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What could you do to get Jehovah’s help?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>(<em>1</em>) <em>Pray. </em></strong>With the account in mind, tell Jehovah how you are feeling about the way you have been mistreated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:6-19:6:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 6:6-9</a>) Be specific. Then ask Jehovah to help you see principles that can guide you as you try to cope with this difficult challenge.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How would you summarize the events involving David and Absalom?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>(<em>2</em>) <em>Imagine. </em></strong>Think about the events in this account, and imagine how King David was affected. David’s son Absalom works for years to make the <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>people love him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:7-10:15:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:7</a>) When Absalom feels that the time is right, he sends spies throughout all of Israel to prepare the people to accept him as their ruler. He even convinces one of David’s close friends and advisers, Ahithophel, to join in the rebellion. Absalom declares himself king, and then he tries to capture and kill David, who may have been seriously ill at the time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:1-19:41:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1-9</a>) David learns of the plot and escapes from Jerusalem. Eventually, Absalom’s army clashes with forces loyal to David. The rebel army loses, and David’s son Absalom is killed.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How could King David have reacted?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Next, imagine how David must have felt as all of this was happening to him. He loved Absalom and trusted Ahithophel. Yet, both of these close companions betrayed him. They hurt him deeply and even tried to kill him. David could have lost faith in his other friends, suspecting that they too had joined Absalom. He might have thought only of himself and have wanted to flee the country alone. Or he could just have given up in despair. But David did none of those things. Instead, he overcame this difficult trial. Why was he able to do so?</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How did David respond to the crisis?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>(<em>3</em>) <em>Meditate. </em></strong>What principles can you learn from the account? Answer the question, “What did David do to help himself?” David did not panic and make hasty, unwise decisions. Neither did he procrastinate, seemingly paralyzed by fear. Instead, he prayed to Jehovah for help. He also asked his friends to help him. And he acted quickly to implement the decisions he made. Although he was deeply hurt, David did not become cynical and bitter. He continued to trust in Jehovah and to trust his friends.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What did Jehovah do to help David?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah help David? By doing some research, you will learn that Jehovah gave David the strength he needed to endure this trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:3:1-19:3:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 3:1-8</a>; superscription) Jehovah blessed the decisions David made.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>(<em>4</em>) <em>Apply. </em></strong>Ask yourself, ‘How can I imitate David?’ You would need to act immediately to solve the problem. Depending on the circumstances, you could apply Jesus’ counsel recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:1-40:18:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 18</a> either directly or in principle. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 18:15-17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But you should not make hasty decisions that are driven by emotion. You should pray for Jehovah to give you a calm heart and the wisdom you need to deal with the matter. Do not lose faith in your friends. Instead, be willing to accept help that is offered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) Most important, follow the advice Jehovah gives you in his Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p>

Our videos and audio dramas and the series “Imitate Their Faith” help bring Bible events to life.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Before you watch, listen to, or read these well-researched accounts, ask Jehovah to help you find specific points that you can apply. Imagine yourself in the place of the main character. Meditate on what these dear servants of Jehovah did and how he helped them to overcome difficulties. Then apply the lessons to your own situation. Thank Jehovah for the help he is already giving you. And show that you appreciate the help by looking for opportunities to encourage and support others.</p>

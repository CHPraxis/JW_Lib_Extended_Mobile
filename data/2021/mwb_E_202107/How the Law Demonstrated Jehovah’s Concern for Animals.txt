How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for Animals




An animal in distress was not to be ignored (De 22:4; it-1 375-376)
A mother bird was not to be treated cruelly (De 22:6, 7; it-1 621 ¶1)
Animals of different types were not to be yoked together (De 22:10; w03 10/15 32 ¶1-2)





The way we treat animals is important to Jehovah. We must not be cruel to animals or kill them just for sport.​—Pr 12:10.

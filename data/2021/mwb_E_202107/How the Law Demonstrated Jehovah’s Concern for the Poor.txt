TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for the Poor




The poor and those who had no inheritance received help from the nation of Israel (De 14:28, 29; it-2 1110 ¶3)
During the Sabbath year, Israelites who owed money were granted “a release” from their debt (De 15:1-3; it-2 833)
In the seventh year of his servitude, an Israelite who had sold himself into slavery was set free and given a gift by his master (De 15:12-14; it-2 978 ¶6)

Show Empathy




Empathy is the ability to understand the thinking, feelings, values, and needs of others. It is easily sensed by others and springs from a heartfelt desire to help. When we show empathy in the ministry, we reflect Jehovah’s love and care, and this draws people to him.​—Php 2:4.
Showing empathy is not a mere technique; it is reflected in the way we listen and speak as well as in our attitude, gestures, and facial expressions. We demonstrate empathy by showing genuine interest in someone. We take note of his interests, beliefs, and circumstances. We offer practical information and assistance but do not pressure him to change. When others respond by allowing us to help them, we increase our joy in the ministry.

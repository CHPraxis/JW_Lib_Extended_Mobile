How Jehovah Wants to Be Worshipped




The Israelites were to obey, love, and serve Jehovah with all their heart and soul (De 11:13; it-2 1007 ¶4)
Remnants of false worship were to be completely destroyed (De 12:2, 3)
Everyone was to worship in one place (De 12:11-14; it-1 84 ¶3)
Jehovah wants his people to worship him whole-souled, to reject all false worship, and to be united.

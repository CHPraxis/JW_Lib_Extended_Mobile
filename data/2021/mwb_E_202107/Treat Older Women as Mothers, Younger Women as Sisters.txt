LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Treat Older Women as Mothers, Younger Women as Sisters




The Scriptures tell us to treat older Christians as if they were our mothers and fathers and the younger ones as our siblings. (Read 1 Timothy 5:1, 2.) Brothers especially need to treat sisters with dignity and respect.
Never would a brother flirt or do anything that would make a sister feel uncomfortable around him. (Job 31:1) A single brother would not toy with the emotions of a single sister by making her feel that he wants to pursue a romantic relationship when he does not.
Elders should give kind consideration to sisters who respectfully ask a question or even point out something that may require attention. Elders are especially considerate of those who do not have a husband to protect them.​—Ru 2:8, 9.

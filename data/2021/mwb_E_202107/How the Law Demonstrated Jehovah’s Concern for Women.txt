TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for Women




Brides did not lose their husbands to the army during their first year of marriage (De 24:5; it-2 1196 ¶4)
Widows were cared for materially (De 24:19-21; it-1 963 ¶2)
Childless widows were given the opportunity to have children (De 25:5, 6; w11 3/1 23)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I show consideration and respect for women in my family and congregation?’

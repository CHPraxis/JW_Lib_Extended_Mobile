<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Scriptures tell us to treat older Christians as if they were our mothers and fathers and the younger ones as our siblings. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:1-54:5:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 5:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Brothers especially need to treat sisters with dignity and respect.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Never would a brother flirt or do anything that would make a sister feel uncomfortable around him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:1-18:31:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 31:1</a>) A single brother would not toy with the emotions of a single sister by making her feel that he wants to pursue a romantic relationship when he does not.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Elders should give kind consideration to sisters who respectfully ask a question or even point out something that may require attention. Elders are especially considerate of those who do not have a husband to protect them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:8-8:2:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ru 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

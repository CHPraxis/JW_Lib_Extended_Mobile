<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do not just teach your student Bible truths, but help him to link them to his life and relationship with Jehovah. Help him to appreciate how Bible standards reflect God’s love, goodness, and righteousness. Tactfully draw him out with questions to help him examine how he feels about what he is learning. Assist him to reason on the personal benefits of correcting a wrong viewpoint or practice. When you see your student’s heartfelt love for Jehovah, your joy will be increased.</p>

Serving Jehovah Is Not Too Difficult




Learning and obeying God’s commandments is not beyond our reach (De 30:11-14; w09 11/1 31 ¶2)
Jehovah has given each one of us a choice (De 30:15; w09 11/1 31 ¶1)
Jehovah urges us to choose life (De 30:19; w09 11/1 31 ¶4)
Serving Jehovah is not too difficult if we rely on him for direction and strength.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">WE HAVE a lot of work to do as this system nears its end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:2-42:10:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 10:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:2</a>) We all want to serve Jehovah as fully as we can. Many are expanding their ministry. Some hope to serve as pioneers. Others hope to serve at Bethel or share in the construction of theocratic facilities. And numerous brothers are reaching out to qualify as a ministerial servant or an elder. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:8-54:3:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>) How pleased Jehovah must be to see this willing spirit among his people!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 6:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>How might we react if we do not reach some of our spiritual goals?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We could begin to feel disheartened, however, if considerable time has passed and we have not yet reached some of our spiritual goals. Or we might be discouraged if because of age or other circumstances, some privileges are not available to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:12-20:13:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 13:12</a>) That is the case with Melissa.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> She would love to serve at Bethel or attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, but she states: “I am over the age limit. Now for me, those privileges are only a dream. At times, I feel discouraged.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What steps might some have to take in order to qualify for certain privileges?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Some who are young and healthy may need to mature and display certain qualities before they can qualify <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>for additional privileges. On the one hand, they may be intelligent, decisive, and eager; on the other hand, they may need to learn to be more patient, thorough, or respectful. If you focus on the needed qualities, a privilege of service may be extended to you when you least expect it. Consider the experience of Nick. When he was 20 years old, he was deeply disappointed because he was not appointed as a ministerial servant. He says, “I felt that there must be something wrong with me.” But Nick did not give up. He took full advantage of the privileges that were open to him. Today he serves as a member of a Branch Committee.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Are you discouraged because you have not yet reached a certain spiritual goal? If so, share your concerns with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:5-19:37:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:5-7</a>) In addition, ask mature brothers for suggestions on how you can improve in your service to God, and then try your best to apply their counsel. If you do, you may well receive that privilege or reach that goal. But as is the case with Melissa, mentioned earlier, the privilege you desire may be beyond your reach at the present time. What then? How can you maintain your joy? To answer that question, this article will discuss (1) where to look for joy, (2) how to increase your joy, and (3) what kind of goals you can set that add to your joy.</p>

<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>WHERE TO LOOK FOR JOY</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>To be joyful, on what should we focus? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:6:9-21:6:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>)</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>As recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:6:9-21:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 6:9</strong></a><strong>, </strong>we can find joy if we look for it in the right place. <strong>(Read.) </strong>A person who <strong><em>enjoys “what the eyes see” </em></strong>appreciates what he has, such as his present circumstances. In contrast, the person who <strong><em>wanders after his desires </em></strong>keeps wishing for something he simply cannot have. So, what is the lesson for us? To find joy, we should focus on what we have and on what we can realistically hope to obtain.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What parable will we now consider, and on what will we focus?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Is it really possible to be satisfied with what you already have? After all, as time passes, we naturally seek out new challenges. Yes, it really is possible. We can <strong><em>enjoy </em></strong>and not merely settle for what our “eyes see.” How can we do that? To find out, let us consider Jesus’ parable of the talents, found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 25:14-30</a>. We will focus on what it can teach us about how to find joy and even increase our joy in the blessings we presently have.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>HOW TO INCREASE YOUR JOY</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Briefly summarize Jesus’ parable about the talents.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In the parable, a man was about to go on a trip. Before leaving, he called his slaves and gave each of them talents with which to do business.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Taking into consideration their individual abilities, the man gave five talents to one slave, two to another, and one to a third slave. The first two slaves cared for these assets diligently. The third slave, however, did nothing with the money he was given, and he was dismissed from the master’s service.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why could the first slave in the parable be joyful?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The first slave must have felt privileged to be entrusted with five of the master’s talents. That was a great deal of money, and it indicated the extent of the master’s trust in him! But what about the second slave? He could have been discouraged because he did not receive as many talents as the first slave did. But how did he respond?</p>

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">What lessons can we learn from the second slave mentioned in Jesus’ illustration? (1) He received two talents from his master. (2) He worked hard to earn more money for his master. (3) He doubled his master’s talents (See paragraphs 9-11)</p>
</figcaption>

</div>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What did Jesus not say about the second slave? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:22-40:25:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 25:22, 23</a>)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:22-40:25:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 25:22, 23</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jesus did not say that the second slave became upset and resentful because he had received only two talents. And Jesus did not portray the slave as complaining: ‘Is this all I get? Why, I am just as capable as the slave who received five talents! If my master does not appreciate me, I may as well bury these two talents and pursue my own interests.’</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What did the second slave do with his talents?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Like the first slave, the second slave took very seriously the responsibility he had been given and worked hard to serve his master. As a result, he doubled the master’s talents. This slave’s diligence and skill were richly rewarded. Not only did his master rejoice but he judged the slave worthy of taking on even more responsibility!</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How can we increase our joy?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Similarly, we can increase our joy by becoming <strong><em>absorbed </em></strong>in whatever we <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>are given to do in Jehovah’s service. Be “intensely occupied” in the preaching work, and be fully involved in congregation activities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:5-44:18:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 18:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Go to the meetings prepared to give upbuilding comments on the material that is being studied. Take seriously any student assignments you have on the midweek meeting. If you are asked to help out with a certain task in the congregation, be punctual and reliable. Do not treat any assignment you are given as if it were unworthy of your time. Strive to improve your skills. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:29-20:22:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 22:29</a>) The more absorbed you are in your spiritual activities and assignments, the quicker you will progress and the greater your joy will be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gal. 6:4</a>) You will also find it easier to rejoice with others when they receive a privilege that you would have liked to receive.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What steps did two Witnesses take to intensify their joy?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Remember Melissa, the sister who expressed her desire to serve at Bethel or attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers? Although unable to fulfill those desires, she says: “I try to be fully involved in my pioneer ministry and to participate in all of its features. This has brought me great joy.” And how did Nick cope with his disappointment when he was passed over for appointment as a ministerial servant? “I focused on the privileges that were available to me​—participating in the field ministry and giving meaningful comments at meetings. I also applied for Bethel service and was accepted the very next year.”</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What will result if you become absorbed in your present assignment? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>If you become fully absorbed in your present assignment, will you receive greater responsibilities in the future? That could happen, as it did for Nick. But if not, like Melissa, your joy will still increase, and you will have a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 2:24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Furthermore, you will no doubt find great joy in knowing that your efforts are pleasing to our Master, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Does focusing on our present assignments mean that we should stop looking for ways to expand our service to Jehovah? By no means! We can and should set spiritual goals that help us to keep stretching forward in our efforts to be productive in the ministry and helpful to our brothers and sisters.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>What goals might you set for yourself?

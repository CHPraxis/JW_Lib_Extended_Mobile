<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Early in his human life, Jesus chose to be submissive to his parents. He never rejected his parents’ direction, reasoning that he knew more than they did. Jesus no doubt took his responsibility as the oldest son seriously. He surely worked hard to learn a trade from his adoptive father so that he could help support his family. Jesus’ parents likely told him about his miraculous birth and what God’s messengers had said about him.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Belief in the resurrection of Jesus is central to our Christian hope. Early in the apostle Paul’s discussion of the resurrection, he brought up three realities. They are (1) “Christ died for our sins.” (2) He “was buried.” (3) He “was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:3-46:15:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:3, 4</a>) What do Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection mean for us? The prophet Isaiah foretold that the Messiah would be “cut off from the land of the living” and be “given a burial place with the wicked.” More was involved, though. Isaiah added that the Messiah would carry “the sin of many people.” Jesus did this by providing the ransom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:8-23:53:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 53:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:12-23:53:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Matt. 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Rom. 5:8</a>) So the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus provide a solid basis for our hope of being set free from sin and death and being reunited with our loved ones who have died. <a class="xt" data-xtid="145" href="jwpub://p/E:2020680/9-11"><em>w20.12 </em>2-3 ¶4-6;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="146" href="jwpub://p/E:2020680/18-18"> 5 ¶11</a></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Usually, the first step in building a close friendship with someone you meet is to spend time with the person. As you talk to each other, sharing thoughts and experiences, you become friends. When it comes to building a close friendship with Jesus, however, we face challenges. One of them is that we have not met Jesus personally. Many Christians in the first century faced the same challenge. Even so, the apostle Peter observed: “Though you never saw him, you love him. Though you do not see him now, yet you exercise faith in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:8-60:1:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:8</a>) So it is possible to form a close relationship with Jesus without having met him personally. Also, we are not able to speak to Jesus. When we pray, we direct our thoughts to Jehovah. True, we do pray in Jesus’ name, but we do not talk directly to him. In fact, Jesus does not want us to pray to him. Why not? Because prayer is a form of worship, and only Jehovah should be worshipped. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>) Even so, we can express our love for Jesus. <a class="xt" data-xtid="149" href="jwpub://p/E:2020365/6-8"><em>w20.04 </em>20 ¶1-3</a></p>

If we rely on Jehovah, he promises not only to train us but also to make us strong! The apostle Paul had to deal with many challenges.

For this reason, Jesus could tell the Jews in his day: “Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:56-43:8:56" data-bid="50-1" class="b">John 8:56</a>) Clearly, Abraham knew that his descendants would form a Kingdom that had Jehovah’s backing, and he was willing to wait for Jehovah to fulfill that promise. How did Abraham show that he was waiting for the city, or Kingdom, designed by God? First, Abraham did not join himself to any earthly kingdom. He remained a nomad, choosing not to settle down and give his support to a human king. In addition, Abraham did not try to set up his own kingdom. Instead, he kept obeying Jehovah and waited for Him to fulfill His promise. In doing so, Abraham showed extraordinary faith in Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="159" href="jwpub://p/E:2020520/10-11"><em>w20.08 </em>3 ¶4-5</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:19-19:94:19" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Ps. 94:19</a>) For example, he may move fellow Christians to come to our aid when we need help with chores. He may move our brothers to pray with us. Or he may bring back to our mind comforting thoughts found in his Word, such as the wonderful hope of perfect life without sickness and pain in the coming new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) However, we may feel limited in what we can do in the ministry. A sister named Laurel was confined to an iron lung for 37 years! She endured cancer, major surgeries, and chronic skin disorders. But it did not silence her. She witnessed to nurses and attendants who came to her home and helped at least 17 people come to an accurate knowledge of the Bible! <a class="xt" data-xtid="172" href="jwpub://p/E:2020687/16-16"><em>w20.12 </em>24 ¶9;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="173" href="jwpub://p/E:2020687/19-19"> 25 ¶12</a></p>

The next day, when Paul was brought before the Sanhedrin, he was almost torn apart by his enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:30-44:21:32" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Acts 21:30-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:30-44:22:30" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 22:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:6-44:23:10" data-bid="100-3" class="b"> 23:6-10</a>) At that point, Paul may have wondered, ‘How much longer can I endure this treatment?’ What help did Paul receive? The night after Paul was arrested, “the Lord,” Jesus, stood by him and said: “Take courage! For just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:11-44:23:11" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Acts 23:11</a>) What timely encouragement! Jesus commended Paul for the witness he had given in Jerusalem. And he promised that Paul would safely reach Rome, where he would give a further witness. After receiving that assurance, Paul must have felt as secure as a child nestled in his father’s arms. <a class="xt" data-xtid="174" href="jwpub://p/E:2020642/6-6"><em>w20.11 </em>12 ¶1,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="175" href="jwpub://p/E:2020642/9-9"> 3;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:2020642/10-10"> 13 ¶4</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6</a>) One way in which Jehovah shows us mercy is by forgiving us for the mistakes we make.

Mercy is an intense feeling that springs from inside a person when he or she sees someone in distress and is moved to try to help the person. Jehovah describes the intense desire he has to help us as being greater than the feelings that a mother has for her child.

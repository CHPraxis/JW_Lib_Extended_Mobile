<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We must have a relationship with Jesus in order for our prayers to be answered. This calls for doing more than simply adding the phrase “in Jesus’ name” to our prayers as a formality. We must recognize how Jehovah uses Jesus in answering our prayers. Jesus told the apostles: “Whatever you ask in my name, I will do this.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:13-43:14:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:13</a>) Although Jehovah is the one who hears and answers our prayers, he has given Jesus the authority to carry out His decisions. Thus, before God answers our prayers, he sees if we have applied the counsel Jesus gave. For example, Jesus said: “If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:14, 15</a>) How important it is, then, that we treat others in the same kind way that Jehovah and Jesus treat us! <a class="xt" data-xtid="218" href="jwpub://p/E:2020365/12-12"><em>w20.04 </em>22 ¶6</a></p>

Use insight to discern the interests of people in your territory and adapt your presentation. How can you find out what a person is interested in as you approach him or his home? Be observant. Perhaps he is gardening, reading a book, repairing a vehicle, or engaging in some other activity. If appropriate, why not use what he is doing to engage him in conversation?

For example, how long would the occupants of a literal boat survive if they had to produce their own oxygen, food, and water and if they could not throw any waste products overboard? The people in that boat would soon die. In contrast, the earth supports billions of living creatures. It produces all the oxygen, food, and water we need, and we do not run out of those vital supplies. Its waste products are not ejected into space; yet, the earth remains beautiful and habitable.

For example, he is providing an abundance of spiritual food in the form of printed and digital publications, audio and video recordings, and Internet broadcasts. Just think: On our official website, information is available in over 1,000 languages! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) Another way we can stay focused on preaching is by following Jesus’ example. He allowed nothing to distract him from bearing witness to the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="50-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) He was not enticed when Satan offered him “all the kingdoms of the world and their glory”; nor was he tempted when others wanted to make him king.

Some share in maintaining the Kingdom Hall, and they show personal interest in fellow worshippers. Of course, they face challenges. Some provide care for elderly parents. Others endure opposition from family members. And still others who are single parents work hard to provide for their children. Why focus on giving support to sisters? Because the world does not always treat women with the dignity that they deserve. In addition, the Bible encourages us to give them support. For instance, the apostle Paul alerted the congregation in Rome to welcome Phoebe and “give her whatever help she may need.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:1-45:16:2" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Rom. 16:1, 2</a>) Paul came from a culture that treated women as being inferior.

That way, we can see if we need to make an adjustment before others see us. Similarly, when we read the Bible each day, we will see ways that we can adjust our thinking and our attitude. Many find it helpful to read the daily text each morning before they leave home. They allow what they read to affect their thinking. Then throughout the day, they look for ways to apply the counsel from God’s Word. In addition, we must have a study routine that includes reading and thinking about God’s Word each day. This may sound simple, but it is one of the most important things we can do to help us stay on the cramped road to life. In a sense, God’s Word acts like an X-ray machine, enabling us to see what is inside.

That can present a challenge. So when considering a potential marriage mate, she would do well to ask herself: ‘What indication do I have that this brother will be a good family head? Do spiritual activities play an important role in his life? If not, what makes me think that he will be a good spiritual head after we get married?’ Of course, a sister also does well to ask herself: ‘What qualities will I bring to the marriage? Am I patient and generous? Do I have a strong relationship with Jehovah?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:9-21:4:9" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:12-21:4:12" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> 12</a>) The level of happiness a wife will experience in her marriage will depend to some extent on the decisions she makes before getting married. Millions of our Christian sisters set an excellent example in being submissive to their husband. They are to be commended! <a class="xt" data-xtid="248" href="jwpub://p/E:2021281/6-7"><em>w21.02 </em>8 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">In recent years, many publishers have made it their goal to learn another language so that they can expand their ministry and serve in a congregation where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers. This is a personal decision that these Christians make in order to advance Kingdom interests. Although it may take years for them to become fluent in the new language, they accomplish much good. Their fine qualities and experience strengthen and stabilize the congregation. We value these self-sacrificing brothers and sisters! A body of elders would not hold back from recommending a brother to serve as an elder or a ministerial servant simply because he is not yet fluent in the language of the congregation. The elders will evaluate a brother based on the Scriptural qualifications for elders and ministerial servants and not on how well he speaks the language of the local congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:10" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:12-54:3:13" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:9" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> Titus 1:5-9</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="249" href="jwpub://p/E:2020522/23-24"><em>w20.08 </em>30 ¶15-16</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">People may think that they can be happy only if they have good health, a lot of money, and peaceful family relationships. But the type of joy that James wrote about is a part of the fruitage of God’s spirit and is not dependent on a person’s circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) A Christian gains joy, or a deep sense of happiness, from knowing that he is pleasing Jehovah and following Jesus’ example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:22-42:6:23" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Luke 6:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:11" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> Col. 1:10, 11</a>) Like a flame burning inside the protection of a lantern, this type of joy burns within a Christian’s heart. It does not flicker when health fails or money is scarce. And it is not snuffed out by ridicule or opposition from family members or others. Rather than being put out, the flame burns brighter each time opposers try to extinguish it. The trials we face because of our faith confirm that we are true disciples of Christ.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">As you come across Bible passages showing that strength comes from keeping calm and trusting in Jehovah, try to commit a few key verses to memory. You may find it helpful to read them aloud or to write them down and review them often. Joshua was commanded to read the book of the Law regularly in an undertone in order to act wisely. These reminders would also help him overcome the fear that he might otherwise have felt in his circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:9" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8, 9</a>) Many expressions found in God’s Word can give you peace of mind and heart in situations that would normally lead to feelings of anxiety or dread.

The key now is to continue to rely on Jehovah. It may seem that it is easy to rely on Jehovah when you must make life-altering decisions, but what about at other times? How important it is that you trust in Jehovah when making decisions, including those regarding entertainment, secular work, and life goals! Do not rely on your own wisdom. Instead, look for Bible principles that apply to your circumstances, and then act in harmony with that direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) If you do so, you will make Jehovah happy and you will earn the respect of those in your congregation.

However, this should not prevent you from doing all you can in Jehovah’s service. <a class="xt" data-xtid="252" href="jwpub://p/E:2021329/21-23"><em>w21.03 </em>6 ¶14-15</a></p>

The apostle Paul wrote this portion of Scripture while he was in prison. Before you read those passages, tell Jehovah about your problem and how it makes you feel. Be specific. Then ask Jehovah to help you discern principles in the accounts about Paul’s trials that will help you to know how you should respond to the challenge you are facing. Jehovah had warned Paul that he would have to endure persecution for being a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:11-44:21:13" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Acts 21:11-13</a>) How did Jehovah help Paul? He answered Paul’s prayers and over time gave him power.

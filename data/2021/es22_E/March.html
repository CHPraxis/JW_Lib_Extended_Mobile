(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:7-60:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:7</a>) And third, we will receive a priceless reward​—everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:6-45:2:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 2:6, 7</a>) Soon after Jesus’ resurrection, the apostles experienced the happiness he spoke about. After being flogged and ordered to stop preaching, they rejoiced. Why? “Because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus’] name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:42" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 5:40-42</a>) They loved their Master more than they feared the hatred of their enemies.

Still, we can be confident that the answer will come at the right time and in the best way. Of course, God’s answer may be different from what we expect.

Because our brothers and sisters​—who are among our closest neighbors—​are imperfect. At times, they may say and do things that we feel are uncaring and unkind. Jehovah knew that we would face this challenge, so he inspired some of the writers of the Bible to include specific counsel on why and how we should show love to one another.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:17" data-bid="96-1" class="b">John 21:15-17</a>) The way that Jesus dealt with Peter highlights Jesus’ mercy, and Jesus perfectly reflects his Father. So when we make mistakes, we should not judge ourselves as being beyond hope. We should bear in mind that Satan wants us to give in to such feelings. Instead, let us try hard to see ourselves​—and those who sin against us—​through the compassionate and loving eyes of our heavenly Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:13-19:103:14" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="99" href="jwpub://p/E:2020682/26-28"><em>w20.12 </em>20-21 ¶17-19</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">We can learn from the experiences of those who failed to keep calm and trust in Jehovah. Studying those bad examples will help us to avoid making the same mistakes they made. For instance, early in his reign, King Asa looked to Jehovah when faced with problems. But later he failed to turn to his God for help, preferring to handle matters on his own. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:1-14:16:3" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:12-14:16:12" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> 12</a>) On the surface, Asa’s asking the Syrians for help against Israel may have appeared to be very practical. But his success was short-lived. Jehovah told him through a prophet: “Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:7-14:16:7" data-bid="100-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7</a>) We must be careful not to feel so confident about handling matters on our own that we fail to look to Jehovah for guidance through his Word. Even when we are faced with an urgent situation, we should calmly rely on Jehovah, and he will help us to succeed. <a class="xt" data-xtid="100" href="jwpub://p/E:2021240/20-22"><em>w21.01 </em>6 ¶13-15</a></p>

However, those of the great crowd are thrilled to know that on escaping the destruction of this wicked system of things, they will always have an abundance of physical and spiritual food. When destruction is unleashed on Satan’s system of things, the great crowd will be spared the “scorching heat” of Jehovah’s anger that he will pour out on the nations. After the great tribulation ends, Jesus will guide these earthly survivors to the “waters of [everlasting] life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:17-66:7:17" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Rev. 7:17</a>) Just think: The great crowd have a unique prospect.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">On the last night of his life as a man, Jesus was thinking about the challenges that his disciples would face. Moved by his love for his friends, Jesus asked his Father to “watch over them because of the wicked one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:15" data-bid="105-1" class="b">John 17:14, 15</a>) Jesus knew that after he returned to heaven, Satan the Devil would continue to wage war against any who wanted to serve Jehovah. Clearly, Jehovah’s people would need protection. Today we need Jehovah’s protection as never before. Satan has been cast out of heaven, “having great anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Rev. 12:12</a>) He has managed to convince some who persecute us that they are offering “a sacred service to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:2-43:16:2" data-bid="107-1" class="b">John 16:2</a>) Others, who do not believe in God, persecute us because we do not fit into this world’s mold.

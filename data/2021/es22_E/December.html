(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 6:19</a>) An anchor stabilizes a ship during a storm and stops it from drifting onto rocks. But an anchor is useful only if the chain that attaches it to the ship does not break. Just as rust weakens an anchor chain, so unresolved doubts weaken our faith. When tested by opposition, a person who has doubts could lose faith that Jehovah will fulfill his promises. If we lose our faith, we lose our hope.

And third, we may help the person to learn something about himself. Sometimes we do not really understand even our own emotions until we express those emotions in words. Some of our brothers and sisters find it difficult to talk about their feelings because of their background, culture, or personality.

We go when it is the right time for the fish, not when it is the right time for us.” Likewise, fishers of men in the first century went to places where the “fish” would be and at a time when they were likely to be there. For example, Jesus’ followers preached at the temple and in the synagogues, from house to house, and in the marketplace.

The father felt empathy for his son, who poured out his feelings. The father then took practical steps to assure his son that he was welcome back home as a cherished member of the family. To prove the point, the father arranged a feast and provided fine clothes for his repentant son. Jehovah is like the father in that illustration.

From that time until the late 19th century, there was no organized group of God’s servants on earth. The weeds of false Christianity flourished and hid the identity of true Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:36-40:13:43" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matt. 13:36-43</a>) Why is that fact significant?

There was no organized group of God’s people for them to attack. However, we can expect that the king of the north and the king of the south would reappear in the late 19th century. <a class="xt" data-xtid="408" href="jwpub://p/E:2020400/11-11"><em>w20.05 </em>3 ¶5</a></p>

In answer to your prayers, you can receive “the peace of God that surpasses all [human] understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) Jehovah calms our anxious thoughts by means of his powerful holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) When approaching Jehovah in prayer, open your heart to him. Be specific. Tell him what the problem is, and explain to him how you feel about it. If there is a possible solution, ask him for the wisdom to find it and the strength to implement it. If the answer to your problem is beyond your control, ask Jehovah to help you not to be unduly worried about it. When you are specific in your prayers, in time you will see more clearly how Jehovah has answered them. If the answer does not come immediately after you have been praying, do not give up. Jehovah wants you to be not only specific but also persistent in your prayers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:8-42:11:10" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Luke 11:8-10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="422" href="jwpub://p/E:2021240/13-14"><em>w21.01 </em>3 ¶6-7</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">The congregation today includes married couples and families. Yet, it also includes many brothers and sisters who are not married. How should we view those who are single? Consider how Jesus viewed singleness. During his earthly ministry, Jesus did not marry. He remained single and focused his time and attention on his assignment. Jesus never taught that it was a requirement to get married or to be single. However, he did say that some Christians would choose not to marry. (See study note on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:12-40:19:12" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Matthew 19:12</a>.) Jesus respected those who were not married. He did not view single people as inferior or lacking in some way. Like Jesus, the apostle Paul carried out his ministry as a single person. Paul never taught that it would be wrong for a Christian to marry. He recognized that this was a personal matter. <a class="xt" data-xtid="423" href="jwpub://p/E:2020522/14-15"><em>w20.08 </em>28 ¶7-8</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">The apostle John had a long, eventful life. He faced all types of challenges that could have weakened his faith. But he always did his best to observe Jesus’ commandments, including the order to love his brothers and sisters. As a result, John was sure that Jehovah and Jesus loved him and that they would give him the strength to overcome any trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:15-43:14:17" data-bid="92-1" class="b">John 14:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:10-43:15:10" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 15:10</a>) Nothing that Satan or his system did could stop John from feeling, expressing, and showing love. Like John, we live in a world dominated by Satan, the hateful god of this system. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:1-62:3:1" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 John 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:10" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> 10</a>) While he wants us to stop loving our brothers and sisters, he cannot make that happen unless we allow him to do so. May we be determined to love our brothers and sisters, to express that love by what we say, and to prove that love by what we do. Then we will have the satisfaction of being part of Jehovah’s family, and life will truly be worth living.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:7-62:4:7" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 John 4:7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="424" href="jwpub://p/E:2021245/27-28"><em>w21.01 </em>13 ¶18-19</a></p>

Our videos and audio dramas and the series “Imitate Their Faith” help bring Bible events to life. Before you watch, listen to, or read these accounts, ask Jehovah to help you find specific points that you can apply. Imagine yourself in the place of the main character. Meditate on what these dear servants of Jehovah did and how he helped them to overcome difficulties. Then apply the lessons to your own situation. Thank Jehovah for the help he is already giving you. And show that you appreciate the help by looking for opportunities to encourage and support others. <a class="xt" data-xtid="425" href="jwpub://p/E:2021320/30-31"><em>w21.03 </em>19 ¶22-23</a></p>

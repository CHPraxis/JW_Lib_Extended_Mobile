But you can be confident that no matter what challenge you face, Jehovah will give you the wisdom to deal with it and the strength to endure it. In his Word, Jehovah included detailed descriptions of how imperfect individuals dealt with difficult trials. Why? So that we can learn from them. That is what Jehovah moved the apostle Paul to write. Reading these accounts can bring us a measure of comfort and hope. However, to benefit, we need to do more than just read the Bible. We must allow the Scriptures to mold our thinking and to touch our hearts. <a class="xt" data-xtid="107" href="jwpub://p/E:2021320/6-7"><em>w21.03 </em>14 ¶1-2</a></p>

Jesus did not write off the Samaritans, as his followers may have done. Instead, he saw them as potential disciples. We too need to see the people in our territory as potential disciples of Christ. The apostle Paul set an outstanding example for us to follow.

Remember that Jesus likened death to sleep and the resurrection to being awakened from sleep.

Decades ago, <em>The Watchtower </em>stated: “We [may] find ourselves stumbling and falling many times over some bad habit that has bitten more deeply into our former pattern of life than we had realized. . . . Do not conclude you have committed the unforgivable sin. That is just how Satan would like you to reason. The fact that you feel grieved and vexed with yourself is proof in itself that you have not gone too far. Never weary of turning humbly and earnestly to God, seeking his forgiveness and cleansing and help.” Before becoming a Christian, the apostle Paul committed a number of serious sins. Paul remembered what he had done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:15" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:12-15</a>) But he viewed the ransom as a personal gift to him.

For example, we might reason: ‘Well, I would not be disfellowshipped for doing this, so it must not be that serious.’ Such reasoning is deeply flawed. We do better to ask ourselves such questions as these: ‘Is Satan trying to use this temptation to divide my heart? If I give in to wrong desires, would I bring reproach on Jehovah’s name? Would this action draw me closer to my God, or might it distance me from him?’ Meditate on such questions. Pray for wisdom to answer them honestly, without self-deception. Doing so can be a real protection. It can help you to reject temptation firmly, as Jesus did when he said: “Go away, Satan!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>) Remember, a divided heart is of little value. <a class="xt" data-xtid="133" href="jwpub://p/E:2020444/24-25"><em>w20.06 </em>12-13 ¶16-17</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Prov. 24:10</a>) How, then, should we view the insults of opposers? Like the apostle Paul, we can “take pleasure . . . in insults.” Why? Because insults and opposition are signals that we are genuine disciples of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:14-60:4:14" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:14</a>) Jesus said that his followers would be persecuted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:18-43:15:20" data-bid="95-1" class="b">John 15:18-20</a>) That proved true in the first century. Back then, those influenced by Greek culture viewed Christians as unintelligent and weak. And among the Jews, Christians were considered to be “uneducated and ordinary,” like the apostles Peter and John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Acts 4:13</a>) Christians seemed to be weak; they had no political influence or military power, and people viewed them as outcasts of society. Did those early Christians allow the negative view of their opposers to stop them? No. <a class="xt" data-xtid="136" href="jwpub://p/E:2020485/9-10"><em>w20.07 </em>14-15 ¶3-4</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:27-62:2:27" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 John 2:27</a>) May we take to heart the counsel he gave.

Reject human philosophies and apostate teachings. Resist the pressure to live a double life and to give in to sin. Live by Jehovah’s high moral standards.

First, “God is not partial.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:34" data-bid="116-1" class="b">Acts 10:34</a>) Love moved Jehovah to give his Son as a “ransom for all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="117-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="117-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) Jehovah uses his people to preach the good news to all who will listen, thereby helping as many as possible to benefit from the ransom.

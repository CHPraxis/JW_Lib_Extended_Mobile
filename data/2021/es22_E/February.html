<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Bible describes Jehovah’s love for his people as a cord, or rope. In what sense is God’s love like a rope? Consider this illustration: Imagine that you are drowning in rough seas and someone throws you a life vest. Surely you would appreciate the help because that may ease your struggle to stay afloat. But a life vest will not be enough to keep you alive. The water is cold, and you will not survive unless you can reach a lifeboat. You need someone to throw you a rope and to pull you toward the lifeboat. As Jehovah said in the words of today’s text, he lovingly “kept drawing” the Israelites who had gone astray. God feels the same way today about those who have stopped serving him and who are drowning in problems and anxiety. He wants them to know that he loves them, and he wants to draw them to him. And Jehovah can use you to express his love to them. It is important to assure inactive ones that Jehovah loves them and that we love them too. <a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:2020441/19-20"><em>w20.06 </em>27 ¶12-13</a></p>

In addition, a humble husband is willing to do household tasks, even if in his community these tasks are viewed as women’s work. That can be a challenge. Why? “Where I come from,” says a sister named Rachel, “if a husband helps his wife wash dishes or clean the home, his neighbors and relatives will question if he is a ‘real man.’ They will think that he cannot control his wife.” If that attitude is common where you live, remember that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, even though it was viewed as a slave’s job.

<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sb">How might we show our trust in Jehovah? By applying the direction that Jehovah gives. The Bible contains many accounts that highlight the value of keeping calm and putting our trust in Jehovah. As you study these accounts, notice what helped God’s servants to remain calm in the face of extreme opposition. For example, when the Jewish supreme court ordered the apostles to stop preaching, they were not intimidated. Instead, they boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) Even after being flogged, the apostles did not panic. Why? Because they knew that Jehovah was on their side. He was pleased with them. Thus, they continued preaching the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:42" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Acts 5:40-42</a>) Likewise, when the disciple Stephen faced death, he remained so peaceful and serene that his face looked “like an angel’s face.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:12-44:6:15" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Acts 6:12-15</a>) Why? Because he was assured of Jehovah’s approval. <a class="xt" data-xtid="67" href="jwpub://p/E:2021240/17-18"><em>w21.01 </em>4 ¶10-11</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Elders, you have the weighty responsibility of helping publishers to be effective in their ministry, including their Bible study work. If someone is shy about conducting a Bible study in your presence, offer to conduct the study. Elders can do a great deal to encourage and to motivate the teachers to persevere. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="114-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>) Even if we do not presently conduct a Bible study, we can still help someone to grow spiritually. Without taking over, we can with our well-prepared comments support the teacher during a study session. We can befriend the students when they come to the Kingdom Hall, and we can serve as good examples for them. And elders can encourage the students by making time for them and the teachers by training and commending them. Really, what greater joy could we have than knowing that we played even a small part in helping someone come to love and serve our Father, Jehovah? <a class="xt" data-xtid="71" href="jwpub://p/E:2021325/26-27"><em>w21.03 </em>13 ¶18-19</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">David proved to be responsible and reliable. For example, as a young man, he diligently looked after his father’s sheep. That turned out to be a dangerous assignment. David later explained to King Saul: “Your servant became a shepherd of his father’s flock, and a lion came, also a bear, and each carried off a sheep from the flock. I went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:34-9:17:35" data-bid="116-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:34, 35</a>) David felt responsible for the welfare of the sheep. Young brothers can imitate David by diligently fulfilling any assignment they are given. Young David developed a close, personal relationship with Jehovah. That relationship was more important than David’s courage or his skill with a stringed instrument. Jehovah was not only David’s God but also his Friend​—his close Friend. Young brothers, the most important thing that you can do is to strengthen your relationship with your heavenly Father. <a class="xt" data-xtid="72" href="jwpub://p/E:2021329/10-11"><em>w21.03 </em>3 ¶4-5</a></p>

Yet, these living creatures never consume all the oxygen, and the atmosphere never becomes choked with the “waste” gas, carbon dioxide. Why not? Because Jehovah also created organisms​—from large trees to tiny algae—​that take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. In a very literal way, the oxygen cycle confirms the words of today’s text.

And if people do accept that God exists, Satan attempts to make them believe that God and His standards are restrictive and unfair. He even teaches people that Jehovah is a heartless and cruel God who burns people in a fiery hell.

However, we need to be cautious about using this method of communication.

Rather than training others and giving them authority, they are likely to say, “If you want something done right”​—the way that pleases them—​“you have to do it yourself.” A proud person is often ambitious and jealous. If we detect that we have a problem with pride, we should earnestly pray for Jehovah’s help to ‘make our mind over’ so that this bad trait does not become deeply rooted within us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) How thankful we are for Jehovah’s example!

In addition, we want to imitate the fine examples found in the Bible of modest people who had the privilege of walking with God. May we always give Jehovah the honor and the glory that he deserves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="282" href="jwpub://p/E:2020525/27-28"><em>w20.08 </em>13 ¶19-20</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:8" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 John 1:8</a>) That is why God’s Word warns married couples that they will face challenges that are described as “tribulation in their flesh.” Jehovah expects Christian husbands to care for the spiritual, emotional, and material needs of their family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="105-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) However, married sisters have to take time from their busy schedule each day to read God’s Word and meditate on it and to turn to Jehovah in earnest prayer. This can be a challenge. Wives are busy, but it is vital that they take the time. Why? Because Jehovah wants each one of us to develop and maintain a personal relationship with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:27-44:17:27" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Acts 17:27</a>) Understandably, a wife may have to work hard to be submissive to her imperfect husband.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Trials can be likened to the fire that is used to forge a blade of steel. When the blade is heated and cooled, the steel becomes stronger. Similarly, when we endure trials, our faith is strengthened.

In his letter, James also identifies some of the things that could cause us to lose our joy. One challenge is not knowing what to do. When undergoing a trial, we want to look to Jehovah for help to make choices that please him, benefit our brothers and sisters, and help us to keep our own integrity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>) We need wisdom to know what course to take and what we should say to those who oppose us.

At times, we may need to “stretch” and “strain” in order to have tender affection for a fellow believer. When others upset us, we need to continue “putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:1-49:4:3" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Eph. 4:1-3</a>) We will look beyond our brothers’ faults and try our best to view our brothers as Jehovah does.

It would be easy for us to develop an unbalanced view of our imperfections and weaknesses. As a result, we might believe that because of our failings, Jehovah would never welcome us into his new world. Such an attitude can be harmful. The Bible reveals that, with the exception of Jesus Christ, all humans “have sinned.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23</a>) But the Bible’s Author is not a faultfinder or perfectionist.

This humble and modest man was thankful for the help he received, and he glorified God for it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:11-42:17:19" data-bid="130-1" class="b">Luke 17:11-19</a>) Humble, modest people tend to get along well with others and are more likely to have close friends. Why?

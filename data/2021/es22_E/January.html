<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Timothy’s faith was built on facts that drew him closer to Jehovah. You too must logically reason on what you have learned about Jehovah from reading the Bible. To start with, you need to prove to yourself at least three basic truths. First, you need to be convinced that Jehovah God is the Creator of all things.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) And third, you need to confirm that Jehovah has an organized group of people who are worshipping him under Christ’s headship and that Jehovah’s Witnesses are that group.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:7-66:9:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 9:7</a>) They torment “those people [God’s enemies] who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads” for a period of five months, the average life span of a locust. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:4-66:9:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 9:4</a>) This does indeed appear to be a description of Jehovah’s anointed servants. They boldly proclaim God’s judgments against this wicked system of things and, as a result, make its supporters very uncomfortable.

But Jehovah saw more in Hagar. He sent his angel to her. When the angel found her, he helped her to adjust her attitude and blessed her. Hagar sensed that Jehovah had been watching her and knew all about her situation. She was moved to call him “a God of sight, . . . the one who sees me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 16:7-13</a>) What did Jehovah see in Hagar?

She reminded me of the good times we shared in the past. She would listen patiently as I expressed my feelings, and she did not hesitate to give me advice. She proved to be a true friend, ready to help at any time.” Empathy is like a powerful ointment; it can help to heal hurt feelings. Some inactive ones have struggled for years with bitter feelings toward someone in the congregation. These feelings have stifled the desire to return to Jehovah.

A brother writes: “When soldiers hit me, insulted me, and threatened me because I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I felt frightened and humiliated.” Such hatred hurts, but it does not surprise us. Jesus foretold that we would be hated. Why does the world hate Jesus’ followers?

You may look forward to the time when you are appointed as a ministerial servant. However, you may feel that others view you as being too young or too inexperienced to be entrusted with important work. Even though you may be young, there are things you can do right now to earn the trust and respect of those in your congregation. Do you young men have a skill that could benefit others in the congregation? Many of you do. For example, you may notice that some older ones appreciate being shown how to make the best use of their tablets and other electronic devices for personal study and for meetings. Your knowledge of these devices can be of great benefit to such older ones. In everything you do, make your heavenly Father proud of you. <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:2021329/6-6"><em>w21.03 </em>2 ¶1,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:2021329/9-9"> 3;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:2021329/27-27"> 7 ¶18</a></p>

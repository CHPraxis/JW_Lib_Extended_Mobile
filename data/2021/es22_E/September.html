(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:16-44:2:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 2:16, 17</a>) Instead of beginning the quotation with the words “after that,” Peter said: “And in the last days”​—in this context, the last days of the Jewish system of things—​God’s spirit would be poured out “on every sort of flesh.” This indicates that considerable time had passed before Joel’s prophecy was fulfilled. It was after that remarkable outpouring of God’s spirit in the first century that the preaching work began to go forward to the greatest extent. By the time the apostle Paul wrote his letter to the Colossians, about 61 C.E., he could describe the good news as being preached “in all creation under heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 1:23</a>) In Paul’s day, “all creation” meant the world as it was then known.

Then, once he located the stray, the shepherd would bring it back to the flock. Further, if the sheep was injured or starving, the shepherd would lovingly support the weak animal, binding its wounds, carrying it, and feeding it.

As we meditate on the Bible accounts of Jesus’ life, we come to love and respect Jesus because of the kind way he dealt with people. For instance, even though he was their Master, he did not treat his disciples as slaves. Instead, he revealed his inner thoughts and feelings to them. Jesus shared their pain and cried with them.

Because Jehovah placed the earth at this ideal location, the earth’s water cycle can sustain life. The sun heats water in the oceans and on the earth’s surface and evaporates the water to form clouds. Each year, the sun evaporates nearly 120,000 cubic miles (500,000 cu km) of water. This water stays in the atmosphere for about ten days before falling as rain or snow. The water eventually makes its way back to the oceans or other bodies of water, and the cycle is repeated.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The Bible is a loving gift from God. Our heavenly Father inspired men to write it because he cares greatly for his earthly children. By means of the Bible, Jehovah answers the most important questions we could ask, such as: Where did we come from? What is the purpose of life? And what does the future hold? Jehovah wants all his children to learn the answers to those questions, so throughout the centuries he has moved men to translate the Bible into many languages. Today, the whole Bible or portions of it are available in over 3,000 languages! The Bible is the most widely translated and distributed book in history. We can prove that we appreciate the Bible by reading it each day, meditating on what it teaches, and doing our best to apply what we learn. In addition, we show our gratitude to God by doing all we can to share its message with as many people as possible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="304" href="jwpub://p/E:2020405/23-24"><em>w20.05 </em>24-25 ¶15-16</a></p>

Why not? “The word of Jehovah” was like a fire inside Jeremiah, and he could not hold it in! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:9-24:20:9" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Jer. 20:9</a>) The same is true of us when we fill our mind and heart with God’s Word. That is an added reason for us to study the Bible daily and meditate on it. As a result, our joy can continue to increase, and our ministry may become more productive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:15:16-24:15:16" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Jer. 15:16</a>) So when you feel discouraged, supplicate Jehovah for his support. He will help you to deal with your imperfections, weaknesses, or illness. He will help you to keep a balanced view of assignments of service. And he will help you to have a positive view of your ministry. Moreover, pour out your concerns to your heavenly Father. With his help, you can win the fight against discouragement. <a class="xt" data-xtid="305" href="jwpub://p/E:2020687/29-30"><em>w20.12 </em>27 ¶20-21</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">This verse describes the way in which Jehovah has organized his universal family. Headship involves two key elements​—authority and accountability. Jehovah is “the head,” or the ultimate authority, and all his children, both angelic and human, are accountable to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:10" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Rom. 14:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:15" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> Eph. 3:14, 15</a>) Jehovah has given Jesus authority over the congregation, but Jesus is accountable to Jehovah for the way he treats us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:27-46:15:27" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:27</a>) Jehovah has also given a husband authority over his wife and children. How can he learn to be a good family head? He must first understand what Jehovah requires of him. He also needs to know why Jehovah established headship and, specifically, how he can imitate the example set by Jehovah and Jesus. Why is this so important? Because Jehovah has given family heads a measure of authority, and he expects them to use it well.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:48-42:12:48" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Luke 12:48b</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="319" href="jwpub://p/E:2021280/6-9"><em>w21.02 </em>2 ¶1-3</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">We do well to imitate Jehovah regarding the things he chooses to forget. For example, Jehovah has a perfect memory, but if we are repentant, he chooses to forgive and forget the mistakes we make.

Some choose to use their brain for selfish purposes​—to set their own standards of right and wrong. But because Jehovah created us, it is only reasonable to expect that his standards are better than any standards we could set for ourselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1, 2</a>) When we live by his standards, our life is peaceful.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">How can we cultivate tender affection for our brothers and sisters today? When we get to know fellow believers better, we may find it easier to understand them and to develop tender affection for them. Age and background need not be a barrier. Remember, Jonathan was about 30 years older than David; yet he developed a close friendship with him. Could you take an interest in someone who is older​—or younger—​than you? By doing so, you can show that you “have love for the whole association of brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>) Does having tender affection for fellow believers mean that we will feel equally close to everyone in the congregation? No, that would not be realistic. It is not necessarily wrong to be drawn more to some than to others because of having similar interests. Jesus referred to all his apostles as “friends,” but he had a special affection for John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:23-43:13:23" data-bid="105-1" class="b">John 13:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:15-43:15:15" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 15:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:2-43:20:2" data-bid="105-3" class="b"> 20:2</a>) However, Jesus did not show favoritism to John.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:35-41:10:40" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Mark 10:35-40</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="321" href="jwpub://p/E:2021246/20-21"><em>w21.01 </em>23 ¶12-13</a></p>

He carefully observed his surroundings and took note of people’s religious customs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:23-44:17:23" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Acts 17:23</a>) Next, Paul searched for common ground between their form of worship and the truth in the Scriptures. So Paul was willing to adapt his approach. He told the Athenians that his message came from the “Unknown God,” whom they had been trying to worship. Although the Gentiles were not familiar with the Scriptures, Paul did not give up on them. Instead, he viewed them as being like grain that is ripe for harvesting, and he adjusted his presentation of the good news. Like Paul, be observant. Look for signs that indicate what beliefs people in your territory have. How has the householder decorated his home or vehicle? Does his name, dress, grooming, or even his vocabulary indicate what his religion is? <a class="xt" data-xtid="322" href="jwpub://p/E:2020360/13-14"><em>w20.04 </em>9-10 ¶7-8</a></p>

Gradually, Russia and its allies emerged as the king of the north. For a government to fill the role of the king of the north or the king of the south, it must do three things: (1) interact directly with God’s people, (2) show by its actions that it is an enemy of Jehovah and his people, and (3) compete with the rival king. Russia and its allies have had a direct impact on God’s people, banning the preaching work and persecuting hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters.

Some might wonder, though, ‘Is not Jehovah’s name already holy, clean, and pure?’ To answer, we need to think about what a name involves. A name is more than a collection of letters written on a page or spoken aloud. Notice what the Bible says: “A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:1-20:22:1" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Prov. 22:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:1-21:7:1" data-bid="87-2" class="b"> Eccl. 7:1</a>) Why does a name have such value? Because it involves a reputation, what others think of the one bearing that name. So the way a name appears on a page​—or even the way it is pronounced—​is not what matters most; what truly matters is whom and what that name stands for in the minds and hearts of others. When people tell lies about Jehovah, they are attacking his reputation. When they attack his reputation, they are trying to damage his name. <a class="xt" data-xtid="383" href="jwpub://p/E:2020443/11-13"><em>w20.06 </em>3 ¶5-7</a></p>

Soon Satan will cause those whom he controls to attack God’s people, so we may worry about how we will react to that attack. We may wonder, ‘Is it wrong for me to feel some concern about such issues?’ We know that Jesus told his followers: “Stop being anxious.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:25" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Matt. 6:25</a>) Does this mean that he expects us to feel no anxiety whatsoever?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:7</a>) As Head of his universal family, Jehovah has the authority to make rules about how his children should behave, and he is able to enforce those rules. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>) Jesus, as head of the Christian congregation, also has the right to make and enforce rules.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) And a family head does not have the authority to make rules for those who are not part of his family.

He must remember, however, that material things cannot satisfy his family’s spiritual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) While Jesus was dying on a torture stake, he wanted to make sure that Mary was cared for.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:26-43:19:27" data-bid="101-1" class="b">John 19:26, 27</a>) A brother who is a family head may have a number of weighty responsibilities. He must be diligent in his secular work so that his conduct reflects well on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:5-49:6:6" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Eph. 6:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:9-56:2:10" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> Titus 2:9, 10</a>) And he may have responsibilities in the congregation, such as shepherding and taking the lead in the preaching work. At the same time, it is important that he regularly study the Bible with his wife and children. They will deeply appreciate his efforts to keep them physically, emotionally, and spiritually healthy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> 6:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="386" href="jwpub://p/E:2021245/23-23"><em>w21.01 </em>12 ¶15,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="387" href="jwpub://p/E:2021245/25-25"> 17</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Describing the role of a capable wife, God’s Word says that she can oversee a household, buy and manage property, and negotiate financial transactions.

Despite his accomplishments, Jesus does not feel that it is demeaning to subject himself to Jehovah’s headship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:28-46:15:28" data-bid="107-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:6" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:5, 6</a>) Likewise, a capable woman who follows Jesus’ example will not feel diminished by submitting to her husband. She will support her husband not only because she loves him but primarily because she loves and respects Jehovah. A submissive Christian wife, however, will not support her husband if he asks her to violate Bible laws or principles. <a class="xt" data-xtid="388" href="jwpub://p/E:2021281/22-23"><em>w21.02 </em>11 ¶14-15;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="389" href="jwpub://p/E:2021281/27-27"> 12 ¶19</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Love for God has always helped Jehovah’s servants to endure persecution. For instance, when the apostles were commanded by the powerful Jewish supreme court to stop preaching, love for God moved them to “obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Acts 5:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) Such unbreakable love also strengthens our brothers today, many of whom are standing firm against cruel and powerful governments. Instead of being discouraged, we count it a privilege to endure the world’s hatred.

When we begin to show interest in the truth, some family members may think that we have been misled. Others may think that we have lost our mind. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:21-41:3:21" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Mark 3:21</a>.) They may even violently oppose us. This negative reaction should not surprise us.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">When you accompany a publisher on his Bible study, listen attentively while the teacher and the student are talking. Only then will you be ready to assist if fitting. Of course, you must use good judgment. For instance, you would not want to talk too much, interrupt the teacher’s line of reasoning, or introduce a different topic. But with a brief comment, illustration, or question, you could help clarify the point being taught. At times, you may feel that you cannot add much to the study. But if you commend the student and show personal interest in him, you will do much to help him to progress. If it is appropriate, you could briefly tell the student how you learned the truth, how you overcame a challenge, or how you have seen Jehovah’s helping hand in your life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:4-19:78:4" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Ps. 78:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:7-19:78:7" data-bid="114-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Your experience could be just what the student needs to hear.

How can we show our appreciation for the privilege of “working together” with God, Christ, and the angels? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:1-47:6:1" data-bid="117-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:1</a>) We can do so by zealously seeking opportunities to share the good news with others. We must not only plant seeds of truth but also water them. When an individual shows interest, we want to do our best to follow up on it with a view to starting a Bible study. As the study progresses, we rejoice when we see how Jehovah works on the heart and mind of a potential disciple. <a class="xt" data-xtid="392" href="jwpub://p/E:2020406/23-23"><em>w20.05 </em>30 ¶14,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="393" href="jwpub://p/E:2020406/25-27"> 16-18</a></p>

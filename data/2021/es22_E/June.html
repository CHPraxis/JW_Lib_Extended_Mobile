It is not easy for them to give up friends in the world and to make all the necessary changes to serve Jehovah. Effective Bible teachers introduce their students to others in the congregation who can have a good influence on them. The students can then enjoy associating with God’s people, who can give them spiritual and emotional support. We want each student to feel that he belongs in the congregation and is part of our spiritual family. We want him to be drawn to our warm and loving Christian brotherhood. Then it will be easier for him to stop having close association with people who do not help him to love Jehovah.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We must be friends with Jesus if we are to have a good relationship with Jehovah. Why is that true? Consider just two reasons. First, Jesus told his disciples: “The Father himself has affection for you, because you have had affection for me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:27-43:16:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 16:27</a>) He also said: “No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Trying to be Jehovah’s friend without building a close bond with Jesus is like trying to enter a building without using the door. Jesus used a similar illustration when he described himself as “the door for the sheep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:7-43:10:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 10:7</a>) A second reason is that Jesus perfectly reflected his Father’s qualities. He said to his disciples: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) So an important way that we come to know Jehovah is by studying the life of Jesus. As we learn about Jesus, our affection for him will grow. And as our friendship with Jesus grows, our love for his Father will deepen. <a class="xt" data-xtid="184" href="jwpub://p/E:2020365/11-12"><em>w20.04 </em>21-22 ¶5-6</a></p>

Based on beliefs you have in common, present the Bible’s message in a way that is appealing to that person. Keep in mind that people may not believe everything that their religion teaches. So even after you discern a person’s religion, try to find out what he personally believes. A missionary brother notes that some people say that they believe in the Trinity, but they may not actually believe that the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit are one God. “Knowing that makes it much easier to find common ground with the person,” he says. So try to find out what people really believe. Then, like the apostle Paul, you can “become all things to people of all sorts.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:22" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-22</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="186" href="jwpub://p/E:2020360/15-16"><em>w20.04 </em>10 ¶9-10</a></p>

The apostle Paul recognized that at times we might have a valid “cause for complaint against” a brother or a sister. We may even have been treated unjustly. If we are not careful, we could become resentful. Bitterness may eventually cause a person to drift away from Jehovah’s people. Pablo, a brother in South America, was falsely accused of wrongdoing and, as a result, lost a privilege of service in the congregation. How did he react? “I got angry,” says Pablo, “and I gradually drifted away from the congregation.” Or a guilty conscience may torment a person who has broken God’s law in the past, making him feel unworthy of God’s love. Even if he was repentant and was shown mercy, he might feel that he is no longer good enough to be one of God’s people. How do you feel about brothers and sisters who face situations like those just discussed? <a class="xt" data-xtid="189" href="jwpub://p/E:2020440/12-13"><em>w20.06 </em>19 ¶6-7</a></p>

Humility has helped many Christian couples find greater happiness in their marriage. For example, a husband named Steven says: “If you are a team, you will work together, especially when there are problems. Instead of thinking ‘what is best for me?’ you will think ‘what is best for us?’” His wife, Stephanie, feels similarly. “Nobody wants to live with an opponent,” she says. “When a conflict arises, we identify the problem. We then pray, do research, and talk it out. We attack the problem, not each other.” Husbands and wives truly benefit when they do not think more of themselves than is necessary. <a class="xt" data-xtid="192" href="jwpub://p/E:2020480/11-12"><em>w20.07 </em>3-4 ¶5-6</a></p>

For example, he decided to create life, not to benefit himself, but to share with us the joy of living. No one could have forced him to give his Son to cover our sins. He willingly decided to make that sacrifice for our benefit. Jesus too made decisions that primarily benefited others. For example, he decided to forgo his own need for rest in order to teach a crowd of people.

Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying on you.” This beautiful expression shows how much confidence Asa had in Jehovah’s ability to save him and his people.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">The Bible contains accounts of imperfect humans who showed tender affection. Consider the example of Jonathan and David. The Bible says: “Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship, and Jonathan began to love him as himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:1-9:18:1" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:1</a>) David was anointed to succeed Saul as king. After that, Saul became resentful of David and tried to kill him. But Saul’s son Jonathan did not join his father in this murderous campaign against David. Jonathan and David promised to remain friends and always to support each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:20:42-9:20:42" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Sam. 20:42</a>) The tender affection between Jonathan and David is all the more remarkable when we consider some factors that could have prevented them from becoming friends. For example, Jonathan was some 30 years older than David. Jonathan could have concluded that he had nothing in common with this much younger and less experienced man. Yet, Jonathan did not view or treat David as an inferior. <a class="xt" data-xtid="212" href="jwpub://p/E:2021246/13-14"><em>w21.01 </em>21-22 ¶6-7</a></p>

But how do we feel about the possibility of being opposed by our family, persecuted by the government, or pressured to do what is wrong by our workmates or schoolmates? Understandably, such possibilities can make us feel anxious. People do not normally view persecution as a reason to feel joyful. Yet, that is exactly what God’s Word tells us to do. For example, the disciple James wrote that instead of feeling overwhelmed, we should consider it a joy when we go through trials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:2" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> 12</a>) And Jesus said that we should be happy even when we are persecuted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:11-40:5:11" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Matt. 5:11</a>) Jehovah inspired James to write to Christians to give them practical advice that would help them remain joyful even when facing trials. <a class="xt" data-xtid="213" href="jwpub://p/E:2021286/6-7"><em>w21.02 </em>26 ¶1-2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="214" href="jwpub://p/E:2021286/11-11"> 27 ¶5</a></p>

How does Satan try to make us give up the treasures that Jehovah has entrusted us with? Note some of Satan’s tactics. He uses entertainment and the media to promote values, thinking, and behavior that he hopes will cause us to loosen our grip on the truth. He attempts to intimidate us through peer pressure or persecution so that we will stop preaching. And he tries to entice us to listen to “the falsely called ‘knowledge’” of apostates so that we will abandon the truth. If we are not careful, we could gradually lose our grip on the truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:21-54:6:21" data-bid="110-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:21</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="215" href="jwpub://p/E:2020567/13-15"><em>w20.09 </em>27 ¶6-8</a></p>

Does God Hear Your Prayers?

When you pray, do you think God really hears you?



WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?






  God is listening. The Bible assures us that “Jehovah is near to all those calling on him, to all who call on him in truth. . . . He hears their cry for help.”​—Psalm 145:18, 19.

  God wants you to pray to him. The Bible invites us: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.”​—Philippians 4:6.

  God really cares about you. God is fully aware of our concerns and anxieties, and he wants to help. “Throw all your anxiety on him,” says the Bible, “because he cares for you.”​—1 Peter 5:7.

Zelophehad’s daughters request their father’s inheritance





TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Imitate Jehovah’s Impartiality




Zelophehad’s five daughters sought to preserve the inheritance of their father (Nu 27:1-4; w13 6/15 10 ¶14; see cover picture)
Jehovah made an impartial decision (Nu 27:5-7; w13 6/15 11 ¶15)
We too must act impartially (Nu 27:8-11; w13 6/15 11 ¶16)
We imitate Jehovah’s impartiality by treating fellow believers with dignity and loyal love and by preaching to people of all backgrounds.

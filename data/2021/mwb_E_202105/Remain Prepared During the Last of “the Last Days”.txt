LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Remain Prepared During the Last of “the Last Days”




As we endure the last of “the last days,” we expect troubles of increasing intensity. (2Ti 3:1; “pangs of distress” study note on Mt 24:8, nwtsty) When facing a disaster, Jehovah’s people often receive timely and lifesaving direction. Our survival then may depend on our obedient preparation now, both spiritually and physically.​—Lu 16:10.
  Prepare spiritually: Develop a good routine. Learn different forms of the ministry. Do not panic if you are temporarily separated from others in the congregation. (Isa 30:15) You are never isolated from Jehovah and Jesus.​—od 176 ¶15-17

  Prepare physically: In addition to go bags, each household should have a reasonable reserve of food, water, medicine, and similar items in case it is necessary to shelter in place for an extended period of time.​—Pr 22:3; g17.5 4, 6

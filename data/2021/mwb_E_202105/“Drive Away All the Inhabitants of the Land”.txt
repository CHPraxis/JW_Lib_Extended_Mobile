TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“Drive Away All the Inhabitants of the Land”




Jehovah commanded his people to eliminate from the Promised Land anything that could stumble them (Nu 33:52; w10 8/1 23)
Jehovah would bless their determined efforts to take complete control of the land (Nu 33:53)
Problems would result if the Israelites did not completely conquer their enemies (Nu 33:55, 56; w08 2/15 27 ¶5-6; it-1 404 ¶2)
To please Jehovah, we must eliminate from our life all morally and spiritually defiling practices. (Jas 1:21) Jehovah gives us the strength to combat sinful tendencies and resist the contaminating influences of this world.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Make Wise Decisions Regarding Alcoholic Beverages









All Christians need to exercise self-control regarding alcoholic beverages. (Pr 23:20, 29-35; 1Co 6:9, 10) If a Christian chooses to drink, he should do so in moderation. He must also avoid dependence on alcohol and avoid stumbling others. (1Co 10:23, 24; 1Ti 5:23) Certainly, no one, especially young ones, should be pressured to consume alcoholic beverages.

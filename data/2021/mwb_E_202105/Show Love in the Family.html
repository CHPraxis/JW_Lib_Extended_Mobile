<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Love is the glue that binds a family together. Without love, a family will struggle to maintain unity and a spirit of cooperation. How can husbands, wives, and parents show love in the family?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A loving <strong>husband </strong>will consider his wife’s needs, point of view, and feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 5:28, 29</a>) He will provide physically and spiritually for his family, including having a regular Family Worship evening. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ti 5:8</a>) A loving <strong>wife </strong>will be in subjection to her husband and show him “deep respect.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph 5:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:6" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1Pe 3:1-6</a>) Both mates must be willing to forgive each other freely. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph 4:32</a>) Loving <strong>parents </strong>show personal interest in each of their children and teach them to love Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">De 6:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eph 6:4</a>) What challenges do their children face in school? How are they coping with peer pressure? When love abounds within the family, all of its members will feel safe and secure.</p>

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“The Judgment Belongs to God”




[Play the video Introduction to Deuteronomy.]
Elders must “judge with righteousness” (De 1:16; w96 3/15 23 ¶1)
Elders “must not be partial in judgment” (De 1:17; w02 8/1 9 ¶4)
How can we all show that we appreciate the elder arrangement?​—Heb 13:17; Jas 5:13-15

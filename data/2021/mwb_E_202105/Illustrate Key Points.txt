Illustrate Key Points




When making return visits or conducting Bible studies, we need to help our listeners understand main points. By illustrating these points, we can stir their heart and make the teachings easier to remember.
As you prepare for a return visit or a Bible study, pick key points, not minor details, that you want to illustrate. Then choose simple illustrations based on daily life. (Mt 5:14-16; Mr 2:21; Lu 14:7-11) Be sure to consider the background and activities of your listener. (Lu 5:2-11; Joh 4:7-15) When you see his eyes light up because he understands a point, you will experience joy.

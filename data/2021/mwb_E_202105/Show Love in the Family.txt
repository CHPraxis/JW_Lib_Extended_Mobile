Show Love in the Family




Love is the glue that binds a family together. Without love, a family will struggle to maintain unity and a spirit of cooperation. How can husbands, wives, and parents show love in the family?
A loving husband will consider his wife’s needs, point of view, and feelings. (Eph 5:28, 29) He will provide physically and spiritually for his family, including having a regular Family Worship evening. (1Ti 5:8) A loving wife will be in subjection to her husband and show him “deep respect.” (Eph 5:22, 33; 1Pe 3:1-6) Both mates must be willing to forgive each other freely. (Eph 4:32) Loving parents show personal interest in each of their children and teach them to love Jehovah. (De 6:6, 7; Eph 6:4) What challenges do their children face in school? How are they coping with peer pressure? When love abounds within the family, all of its members will feel safe and secure.

CAUTIONS REGARDING TECHNOLOGY

Parents may consider setting time limits for themselves and their children on the use of these devices. Furthermore, parents need to determine if their young children may communicate online and with whom.

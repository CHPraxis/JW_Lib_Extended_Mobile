TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Pay Your Vows




Israelite vows were voluntary but binding (Nu 30:2; it-2 1162)
Vows may include abstaining from things not prohibited (Nu 30:3, 4; it-2 1162)
Jehovah now deals with his worshippers individually (Nu 30:6-9; w04 8/1 27 ¶3)
The two most important vows a Christian can make today are the dedication vow and the marriage vow.





ASK YOURSELF, ‘Am I living up to the vows that I have made?’

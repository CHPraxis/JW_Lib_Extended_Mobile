TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“You Must Not Form Any Marriage Alliances With Them”




Jehovah required the Israelites to marry only fellow believers (De 7:3; w12 7/1 29 ¶2)
Jehovah wants his servants to avoid pain and heartache (De 7:4; w15 3/15 30-31)
Jehovah’s viewpoint regarding marriage has not changed (1Co 7:39; 2Co 6:14; w15 8/15 26 ¶12)
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How does the requirement to marry “only in the Lord” benefit me?’

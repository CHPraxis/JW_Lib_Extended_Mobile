TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Take Refuge in Jehovah




Six cities of refuge were provided in Israel for unintentional manslayers (Nu 35:15; w17.11 9 ¶4)
The elders in Israel judged each case (Nu 35:24; w17.11 9 ¶6)
The cities of refuge provided safety and security (Nu 35:25; w17.11 11 ¶13)
Just as the unintentional manslayer had to make sacrifices in order to enjoy the protection of the cities of refuge, we make sacrifices in order to benefit from God’s mercy and forgiveness.

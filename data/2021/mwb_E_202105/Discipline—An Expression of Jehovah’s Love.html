<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Discipline relates mainly to instruction and education, but it also includes correction and chastisement. Jehovah disciplines us so that we may worship him acceptably. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ro 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:10-58:12:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb 12:10, 11</a>) At times, discipline may be painful, but it leads to righteousness and blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:7-20:10:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Pr 10:7</a>) What should those who give discipline and those who receive it keep in mind?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>The giver. </strong>Elders, parents, and others try hard to give discipline with kindness and love as Jehovah does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:28-24:46:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer 46:28</a>) Even strong discipline should be given according to the need and motivated by love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:13-56:1:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Tit 1:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>The receiver. </strong>Whatever form discipline takes, we should not reject it but try to apply it immediately. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Pr 3:11, 12</a>) As imperfect humans, we all need discipline, which comes in various forms. We may be disciplined by what we read in the Bible or hear at congregation meetings. Or at times some need discipline from a judicial committee. Heeding discipline ultimately leads to life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:17-20:10:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Pr 10:17</a>.</p>

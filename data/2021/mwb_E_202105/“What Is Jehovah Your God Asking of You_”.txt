TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“What Is Jehovah Your God Asking of You?”




Obey Jehovah out of awe and love (De 10:12; w09 10/1 10 ¶3-4)
Obedience leads to blessings (De 10:13; w09 10/1 10 ¶6)
Jehovah wants us to draw close to him (De 10:15; cl 16 ¶2)
Jehovah does not force us to obey him. Rather, he wants us to love and obey him “from the heart.” (Ro 6:17) Those who choose to serve Jehovah enjoy the best way of life.

Teach With Enthusiasm




Enthusiasm is contagious. It can capture the attention of our listeners. It also shows that we value our message. Regardless of our cultural background or personality, we can cultivate enthusiasm. (Ro 12:11) How?
First, think about the importance of your message. You have the privilege to “declare good news of good things!” (Ro 10:15) Second, meditate on the positive effect that the good news can have on your listeners. They really need to hear what you have to say. (Ro 10:13, 14) Finally, speak with zeal, using natural gestures and sincere facial expressions.

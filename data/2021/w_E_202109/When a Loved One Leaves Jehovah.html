<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Think how heartbroken Jehovah must have been when members of his own angelic family turned their back on him! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jude 6</a>) And imagine how hurt he was at seeing his beloved people, the Israelites, rebel against him time and again. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:40-19:78:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 78:40, 41</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Be assured that our loving heavenly Father is also hurt when someone you love leaves him.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How do many parents feel when a son or a daughter leaves Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When a precious son or daughter leaves Jehovah, it is common for the parents to wonder what more they could <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>have done to help their young one stay in the truth. After his son was disfellowshipped, a brother named Luke admitted: “I blamed myself. I had nightmares about it. Sometimes I would cry and my heart ached.” Elizabeth, a sister who faced a similar situation, agonized: “What did I do wrong as a mother? I felt that I must have failed to inculcate the truth in my son.”</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Who is responsible when a person leaves Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We need to remember that Jehovah has given each of us the gift of free will. This means that we can choose whether we will obey him or not. Some young ones whose upbringing was far from ideal choose to serve Jehovah, and they make a success of their service. Others whose parents did their very best to bring them up in harmony with Scriptural principles turn their back on the truth once they get older. In the final analysis, we must personally decide whether we will serve Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 24:15</a>) So, grieving parents, fight the tendency to think that this tragedy must be your fault!</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How might a young person be affected when a parent leaves God?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>At times, a parent abandons the truth and even the family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 27:10</a>) This can be devastating for children who had looked up to the parent as a role model. Esther, whose father was disfellowshipped, says: “I cried often because I realized that he was not just drifting away from the truth. He was making a deliberate choice to leave Jehovah altogether. I love my father, so when he was disfellowshipped, I constantly worried about his well-being. I even had panic attacks.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What are Jehovah’s feelings toward a young person whose parent is disfellowshipped?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Young ones, if one of your parents has been disfellowshipped, our heart aches for you! Please be assured that Jehovah is also keenly aware of your pain. He loves you and appreciates your loyalty, and so do we​—your brothers and sisters. Remember, too, that you are <strong><em>not </em></strong>responsible for your parent’s decisions. As mentioned earlier, Jehovah has put a choice before every human. And each dedicated and baptized individual must “carry his own load of responsibility.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>, ftn.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>When someone you love leaves Jehovah, you understandably hold on to the hope that one day he will return to Him. What can you do in the meantime? You can look after your own spiritual health. By doing so, you will set a good example for other family members and perhaps even for the disfellowshipped one. You will also gain the needed strength to cope with your painful emotions. Let us discuss some practical steps you can take.</p>

Draw strength from Jehovah by maintaining a routine of reading God’s Word and meditating on it as well as attending Christian meetings. Joanna, whose father and sister left the truth, says: “I feel a calm come over me when I read about such Bible characters as Abigail, Esther, Job, Joseph, and Jesus. Their examples feed my heart and mind with positive thoughts that soothe the pain. I have also found our original songs to be very encouraging.”</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Pour out your concerns to Jehovah. When you experience distressing feelings, do not stop praying to him. Beg our loving God to help you view the situation from his perspective and to “give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:6-19:32:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 32:6-8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Of course, it may be very painful to tell Jehovah how you really feel. But Jehovah fully understands your pain of heart. He loves you very much and urges you to pour out your heart to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:7-19:62:8" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 62:7, 8</a>.</p>

We simply do not have all the facts. It is wise, then, to trust that the elders who took judicial action made every effort to follow Scriptural principles and to judge “for Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:19:6-14:19:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>By supporting the elders’ decision to disfellowship your loved one, you may actually help him to return to Jehovah. “Severing family association with our adult son was extremely difficult,” admits Elizabeth, quoted earlier. “But after he returned to Jehovah, he admitted that he deserved to be disfellowshipped. In time, he expressed appreciation for the lessons he learned. I came to value Jehovah’s discipline,” she says. Her husband, Mark, adds: “Much later, our son told me that he wanted to come back in part because we did exactly what we had to do. I’m so glad Jehovah helped us to be obedient.”</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Confide in understanding friends.

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Why do we need to “continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely”?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Be patient with your brothers and sisters. Realistically, not everyone will respond in an ideal way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) We are all imperfect, so do not be surprised if some struggle with what to say or even unintentionally make comments that cause you pain. Remember the apostle Paul’s admonition: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 3:13</a>) One sister whose relative was disfellowshipped explains: “Jehovah has helped me to forgive brothers who tried to do the right thing in an imperfect way.” What can the congregation do to help faithful family members?</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Warmly welcome faithful family members. A sister named Miriam admits that she was anxious about going to the meetings after her brother was <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>disfellowshipped. “I was afraid of what people would say. But there were wonderful friends who shared my sadness without showing resentment toward my disfellowshipped brother. Thanks to them, I did not feel alone in my grief.” Another sister recalls: “After our son was disfellowshipped, dear friends came to comfort us. Some admitted that they did not know what to say.

Think of the high price Jehovah has paid​—the ransom sacrifice of his own beloved Son—​for the lives of sinners. Jehovah compassionately reaches out to help such ones return to him.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you carefully read this year’s issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>James 5:11</strong></a> <strong>provides what assurance in saying that Jehovah is “very tender in affection” and “merciful”?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">We know that Jehovah, in his mercy, is inclined to forgive our errors. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 5:11</a> assures us that he also affectionately offers to help us. We do well to imitate him.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2021246/9-13:102"><em>w21.01, </em>p. 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>Why did Jehovah establish the headship arrangement?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">He did so out of love. This arrangement allows his loyal family to function in a peaceful, orderly way. Each family member who works in harmony with this arrangement knows who is responsible for making final decisions and for taking the lead in carrying them out.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:2021280/9:275-16:111"><em>w21.02, </em>p. 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>Why should Christians be careful about using electronic messaging applications?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">If a person chooses to use such applications, he needs to be selective in his choice of associates. That is harder to do with large messaging groups. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:13-54:5:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:13</a>) There are also dangers involving the spread of unconfirmed reports and the use of theocratic contacts for commercial purposes.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:2021327/1-11"><em>w21.03, </em>p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>What are some reasons why God allowed Jesus to suffer and die?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">One reason is that by Jesus’ being hung on a stake, it was possible for the Jews to be freed from a curse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:10-48:3:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 3:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13</a>) A second is that Jehovah was training Jesus for his role as High Priest. And a third is that Jesus’ loyalty to death proved that humans can be faithful despite severe tests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:9-18:1:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11</a>)​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:2021366/8:219-19"><em>w21.04, </em>pp. 16-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>What can you do if people are hard to find in the ministry?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">You can try to reach them at a time when they are more likely to be at home. You can also try preaching in a different location. And you can try a different approach, such as letter writing.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:2021404/8:236-16:307"><em>w21.05, </em>pp. 15-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>What did the apostle Paul mean when he said: “Through law I died toward law”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:19-48:2:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Gal. 2:19</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">The Mosaic Law made human imperfection manifest and guided Israel to the Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gal. 3:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:24-48:3:24" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 24</a>) This led Paul to accept Christ. In doing so, Paul “died toward law”; he was no longer bound to it.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:2021442/1-7"><em>w21.06, </em>p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>How has Jehovah set the example for us in showing endurance?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Jehovah has endured the reproach brought on his name, the opposition to his sovereignty, the rebellion of some of his children, the constant lies of Satan, the suffering of his servants, the separation from friends who have died, the oppression of the human family, and the ruining of his creative works.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:2021481/9:398-22"><em>w21.07, </em>pp. 9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>Joseph set what fine example of patience?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">He endured unjust treatment from his brothers. That led to his being falsely accused and imprisoned in Egypt for years.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:2021521/21:68-23:148"><em>w21.08, </em>p. 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:6-37:2:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Haggai 2:6-9,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:20-37:2:22" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <strong>20-22</strong></a> <strong>foretells what figurative shaking?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">The nations react negatively to the Kingdom preaching, but many people have been drawn to the truth. Soon the nations will finally be shaken when they are destroyed.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:2021562/9-35"><em>w21.09, </em>pp. 15-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>Why should we not give up in carrying out our ministry?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">Jehovah sees our efforts, and he is pleased. If we do not tire out or give up, we will gain everlasting life.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:2021605/8:372-18:268"><em>w21.10, </em>pp. 25-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>How can </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:1-3:19:37" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus chapter 19</strong></a> <strong>help us to apply the counsel: “Become holy yourselves in all your conduct”?

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">That verse is likely a quotation from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:2-3:19:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:2</a>. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:1-3:19:37" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Chapter 19</a> provides many examples of how we can apply <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:15</a> in our daily life.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2021680/9-19"><em>w21.12, </em>pp. 3-4</a>.</p>

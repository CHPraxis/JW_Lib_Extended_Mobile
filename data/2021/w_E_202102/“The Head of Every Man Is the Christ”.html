<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>What factors are likely to influence a man’s view of headship?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">WHAT does the word “headship” mean to you? Some men allow tradition, culture, or their own family background to determine the way they treat their wife and children. Note what Yanita, a sister who lives in Europe, says, “Where I live, there is a deeply ingrained view that women are inferior to men and should be viewed as servants.” And a brother named Luke, who lives in the United States, says, “Some fathers teach their sons that women should be seen and not heard, that their opinion is not important.” However, those attitudes do not reflect the way Jehovah wants men to exercise their headship. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:13-41:7:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 7:13</a>.) How, then, can a man learn to be a good family head?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What must a family head know, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>To be a good family head, a man must first understand what Jehovah requires of him. He also needs to know why Jehovah established headship and, specifically, how he can imitate the example set by Jehovah and Jesus. Why is it important for a man to gain such knowledge? Because Jehovah has given family heads a measure of authority, and he expects them to use it well.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:48-42:12:48" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 12:48b</a>.</p>

Headship involves two key elements​—authority and accountability.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:22-23:33:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>) Jesus, as head of the Christian congregation, also has the right to make and enforce rules.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:2-48:6:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gal. 6:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:18-51:1:20" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Col. 1:18-20</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Following the pattern set by Jehovah and Jesus, the head of a Christian family has the authority to make decisions for his family.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah established headship out of love for his family. It is a gift from him. Headship makes it possible for Jehovah’s family to function in a peaceful, orderly way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 40</a>) Without the clear-cut role of headship, Jehovah’s family would become disorganized and unhappy. For example, no one would know who should make final decisions and who should take the lead in carrying out those decisions.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:28" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 28</a>, did Jehovah intend that men should dominate women?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>If God’s arrangement for headship is such a good thing, why do so many women today feel oppressed and dominated by their husband? This is because many men ignore Jehovah’s standards for the family and choose instead to follow local customs or traditions. They may also abuse their wives to satisfy some selfish desire. For example, a husband might dominate his wife in an attempt to boost his self-respect or to prove to others that he is a “real man.” He may reason that he cannot force his wife to love him, but he can make her fear him. And he may use that fear as a way to control her.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> That type of thinking and conduct clearly deprives women of the honor and respect to which they are entitled, and it is directly opposite to what Jehovah wants.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 5:25,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:28" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> <strong>28</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What can a family head learn about humility from the example set by Jehovah and Jesus?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup><em>Lessons for us. </em></strong>A family head can show humility in many ways. For example, he does not expect perfection from his wife and children. He listens to the opinions of family members, even when they do not agree with his. Marley, who lives in the United States, says: “My husband and I sometimes have different opinions. But I feel that he appreciates and respects me because he asks for my opinion and carefully considers it before he makes a decision.” In addition, a humble husband is willing to do household tasks, even if in his community these tasks are viewed as women’s work. That can be a challenge. Why? “Where I come <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>from,” says a sister named Rachel, “if a husband helps his wife wash dishes or clean the home, his neighbors and relatives will question if he is a ‘real man.’ They will think that he cannot control his wife.” If that attitude is common where you live, remember that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, even though it was viewed as a slave’s job. A good family head is concerned, not about making himself look good, but about making his wife and children feel good. In addition to humility, what other quality is essential for a good family head?</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What does love motivate Jehovah and Jesus to do?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup><em>Love. </em></strong>Everything Jehovah does is motivated by love.

He provides for our emotional needs by assuring us that we are loved. And what about our material needs? Jehovah “richly provides us with all the things we enjoy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:17-54:6:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:17</a>) When we make mistakes, he corrects us, but he does not stop loving us.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>A family head who imitates Jehovah and Jesus makes allowances for the imperfections of family members. He does not become “bitterly angry” with his wife or children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Col. 3:19</a>) Instead, he applies the principle recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1</a> and tries to readjust them “in a spirit of mildness,” remembering that he too is imperfect.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup><em>Make unselfish decisions. </em></strong>Jehovah makes decisions that are in the best interests of others. For example, he decided to create life, not to benefit himself, but to share with us the joy of living. No one could have forced him to give his Son to cover our sins. He willingly decided to make that sacrifice for our benefit. Jesus too made decisions that primarily benefited others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:3-45:15:3" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Rom. 15:3</a>) For example, he decided to forgo his own need for rest in order to teach a crowd of people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:31-41:6:34" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Mark 6:31-34</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Jehovah has given family heads a challenging assignment, and he holds them accountable for the way they accomplish it. But if a husband strives to follow the example set by Jehovah and Jesus, he will be a good family head. And if his wife fulfills her role, the marriage will be a happy one. How should a wife view headship, and what challenges does she face? The next article will answer those questions.</p>

<div><p id="p38" data-pid="38">The perception that it is acceptable for a man to mistreat his wife, even physically abusing her, has sometimes been conveyed in films, in plays, and even in comic books.

One reason is that all of us do our best to respect the headship arrangement that Jehovah has put in place. In fact, the better we understand the headship arrangement, the more united we become.</p>

Among other things, we will answer the following questions: What is the role of sisters? Is it true that every brother is the head of every sister? Do elders have the same type of authority over brothers and sisters as a family head has over his wife and children? First, let us consider how we should view sisters.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As the preceding paragraphs show, there is no Scriptural basis for thinking that sisters are inferior to brothers. Our loving and generous sisters are a real asset, and the elders rely on their help to promote peace and unity in the congregation. But some questions need answering. For instance: Why does Jehovah require a sister to wear a head covering on certain occasions? Since only brothers are appointed as elders and ministerial servants, does this imply that every brother is the head of every sister in the congregation?</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The short answer is no!

A baptized son is <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>not the head of his mother. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1, 2</a>) And in the congregation, the elders have only limited authority over sisters and brothers.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:12-54:2:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:12</a>) Why? For the same reason that he has appointed Jesus as head of the man​—to keep good order in his family. If because of circumstances a sister must fill a role that is normally cared for by a brother, then Jehovah requires that she wear a head covering.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:4-46:11:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:4-7</a>) Jehovah asks this of sisters, not to demean them, but to give them a way to show respect for the headship principle that he has put in place.

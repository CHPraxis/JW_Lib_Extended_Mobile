LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
We Thank Jehovah for Your Love




The congregation in Thessalonica showed love to fellow Christians despite hardships. (2Th 1:3, 4) Jehovah’s people today show similar love for the worldwide association of brothers. The jw.org article series “How Your Donations Are Used” highlights ways that your donations have supported your brothers during these difficult times. We commend you for your love and generous support.

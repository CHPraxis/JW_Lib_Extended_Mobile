LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
A Daunting Assignment Accomplished by Holy Spirit









Throughout history, God’s servants have accomplished amazing things, not because of their own ability, but because of Jehovah’s help. In 1954, Jehovah’s organization released a film entitled The New World Society in Action. It was produced primarily by Bethelites who had no experience in filmmaking. This daunting project was accomplished only by Jehovah’s holy spirit. It gives us confidence that if we rely on Jehovah, we can be successful in carrying out any assignment we receive.​—Zec 4:6.

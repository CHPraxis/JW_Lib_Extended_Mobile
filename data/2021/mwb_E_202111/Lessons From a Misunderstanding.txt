TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Lessons From a Misunderstanding




The tribes living east of the Jordan built a large, impressive altar (Jos 22:10)
The other tribes accused them of unfaithfulness (Jos 22:12, 15, 16; w06 4/15 5 ¶3)
The mild response of those wrongfully accused averted bloodshed (Jos 22:21-30; w08 11/15 18 ¶5)
What does this account teach us about how to react if we are wrongfully accused and about the importance of not drawing conclusions when we do not know the facts?​—Pr 15:1; 18:13.

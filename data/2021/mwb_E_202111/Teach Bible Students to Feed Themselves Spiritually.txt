Teach Bible Students to Feed Themselves Spiritually




In order to satisfy their spiritual need and progress to spiritual maturity, Bible students must learn more than the truths that we teach them. (Mt 5:3; Heb 5:12–6:2) They must also learn how to feed themselves spiritually.
From the beginning, show your Bible students how to prepare for their Bible study, and encourage them to do so. (mwb18.03 6) Encourage them to pray before each session of personal study. Help them to access and use digital tools for study. Explain how to keep up with what is new on jw.org and JW Broadcasting®. Progressively teach them to read the Bible every day, to prepare for congregation meetings, and to research the answers to their questions. Help them to meditate on what they are learning.

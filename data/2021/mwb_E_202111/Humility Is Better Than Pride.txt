Humility Is Better Than Pride




Humility helped Gideon to promote peace (Jg 8:1-3; w00 8/15 25 ¶3)
Humility caused Gideon to seek Jehovah’s glory rather than his own (Jg 8:22, 23; w17.01 20 ¶15)
Pride resulted in Abimelech bringing harm upon himself and others (Jg 9:1, 2, 5, 22-24; w08 2/15 9 ¶9)





How can humility help us when we respond to an irate householder?

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Tips for Making Meetings for Field Service Practical




Meetings for field service, like all congregation meetings, are a provision from Jehovah that enables us to incite one another to love and fine works. (Heb 10:24, 25) They should be five to seven minutes long, which includes organizing the groups, assigning territory, and saying a prayer. (If the meeting follows another meeting, it should be even shorter.) The conductor should prepare something that will be practical for those participating in the ministry that day. For example, on Saturday when many in attendance have not shared in the ministry since the previous weekend, it may be practical simply to consider what to say. What are some other subjects that might be beneficial to discuss?

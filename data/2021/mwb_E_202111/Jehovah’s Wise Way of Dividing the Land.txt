TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah’s Wise Way of Dividing the Land




Jehovah gave direction by lot, perhaps to designate the approximate location of each tribal inheritance (Jos 18:10; it-1 359 ¶1)
Jehovah ensured that Jacob’s deathbed prophecy was fulfilled (Jos 19:1; it-1 1200 ¶1)
Jehovah allowed the people to determine the extent of each tribe’s territory (Jos 19:9; it-1 359 ¶2)
The land was divided in a way that prevented jealousy or quarreling between the tribes. What confidence does this give you about how Jehovah will direct matters in the new world?

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
A Story of Courage and Intrigue




[Play the video Introduction to Judges.]
Jehovah raised up Ehud to deliver Israel from the Moabites (Jg 3:15; w04 3/15 31 ¶3)
Ehud assassinated King Eglon and led Israel to victory (Jg 3:16-23, 30; w04 3/15 30 ¶1-3)
What does this account teach us about courage and reliance on Jehovah?

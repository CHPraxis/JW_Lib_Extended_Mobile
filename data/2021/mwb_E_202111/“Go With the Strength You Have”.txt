TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“Go With the Strength You Have”




Jehovah gave Gideon a daunting assignment (Jg 6:2-6, 14)
Gideon felt unqualified and unworthy (Jg 6:15; w02 2/15 6-7)
Gideon was successful because of Jehovah’s strength (Jg 7:19-22; w05 7/15 16 ¶3)





Jehovah expects us to use the strength we have to worship him. His holy spirit can make up for any lack and give us success.​—Isa 40:30, 31.

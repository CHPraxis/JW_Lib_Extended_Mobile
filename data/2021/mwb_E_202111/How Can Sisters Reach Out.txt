LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
How Can Sisters Reach Out?




Sisters make valuable contributions to the Kingdom work. (Ps 68:11) They conduct many of the home Bible studies and make up a large percentage of the regular pioneers. Thousands of hardworking sisters serve as Bethelites, missionaries, construction volunteers or servants, and translators. Mature sisters build up their families and congregations. (Pr 14:1) Although sisters cannot serve as elders or ministerial servants, they can still set goals in the congregation. If you are a sister, what are some ways that you can reach out?
  Cultivate spiritual qualities. ​—1Ti 3:11; 1Pe 3:3-6

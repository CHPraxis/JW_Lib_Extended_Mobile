How Faith Makes Us Courageous




The spies who gave a bad report lacked faith (Nu 13:31-33; 14:11)
The lack of faith of the ten spies disheartened their brothers (Nu 14:1-4)
The spies who maintained courage had strong faith (Nu 14:6-9; w06 10/1 16-17 ¶5-6)
The Israelites had already witnessed Jehovah’s saving acts in their behalf. This should have strengthened their faith that he would help them conquer Canaan.

Why Avoid a Complaining Spirit?




A complaining spirit displeases Jehovah (Nu 11:1; w01 6/15 17 ¶20)
A complaining spirit demonstrates selfishness and a lack of appreciation (Nu 11:4-6; w06 7/15 15 ¶7)
A complaining spirit discourages others (Nu 11:10-15; it-2 719 ¶4)
Although the Israelites experienced many hardships in the wilderness, they still had much to be thankful for. If we regularly count our blessings, we will be less inclined to complain.

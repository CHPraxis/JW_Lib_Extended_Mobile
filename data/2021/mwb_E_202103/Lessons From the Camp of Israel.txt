TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Lessons From the Camp of Israel




Appointed men take the lead in sacred service (Nu 7:10; it-1 497 ¶3)
God’s servants should be well-organized and orderly (Nu 7:11; it-2 796 ¶1)
Jehovah considers the limitations of individuals (Nu 8:25, 26; w04 8/1 25 ¶1)
Just as Jehovah organized Israel, he has organized his people today. However, he still sees each one of us and takes note of our individual efforts to serve him.

Jehovah Turns a Curse Into a Blessing




The Moabites sought to harm the Israelites (Nu 22:3-6)
Jehovah acted in behalf of his people (Nu 22:12, 34, 35; 23:11, 12)
No one can successfully oppose Jehovah (Nu 24:12, 13; bt 53 ¶5; it-2 291)
Nothing, including persecution or disasters, can prevent the good news from being preached according to God’s will. When we experience personal hardships, do we rely on our heavenly Father and keep his worship our priority?

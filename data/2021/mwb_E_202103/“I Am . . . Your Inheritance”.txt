TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
“I Am . . . Your Inheritance”




Jehovah gave the priests and the Levites a priceless privilege of service (Nu 18:6, 7)
The tribe of Levi received no land allotment but had Jehovah as their inheritance (Nu 18:20, 24; w11 9/15 13 ¶9)
The nation gave a tenth of its produce to support the Levites and the priesthood (Nu 18:21, 26, 27; w11 9/15 7 ¶4)
Jehovah promised the priests and the Levites that he would care for their basic material needs. We can be confident that Jehovah will support us if we make sacrifices to serve him.

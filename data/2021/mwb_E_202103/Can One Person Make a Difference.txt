TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Can One Person Make a Difference?




Israel was lured into wrongdoing by Moab (Nu 25:1, 2; lvs 118 ¶1-2)
Israel’s disloyalty and selfishness brought Jehovah’s rage (Nu 25:3-5; lvs 119 ¶4)
Jehovah turned away his wrath because of one person’s decisive act of courage (Nu 25:6-11)





ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what situations do I need courage to stand out as different?’

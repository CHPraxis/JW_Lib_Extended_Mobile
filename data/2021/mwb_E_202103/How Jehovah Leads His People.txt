TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
How Jehovah Leads His People




Jehovah decided where his people should go and when (Nu 9:17, 18; it-1 398 ¶3)
Those in the camp needed to obey promptly (Nu 9:21, 22; w11 4/15 4-5)
Jehovah used imperfect human representatives to give direction (Nu 10:5-8)
When we obey those taking the lead, we demonstrate obedience to Jehovah.

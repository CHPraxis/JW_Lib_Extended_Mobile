APPLY YOURSELF TO THE FIELD MINISTRY | INCREASE YOUR JOY IN THE MINISTRY
Ask Questions




Jehovah, “the happy God,” wants us to enjoy the ministry. (1Ti 1:11) Our joy will grow as we work to improve our skills. Asking questions can stimulate interest and is a natural way to start a conversation. Questions encourage people to think and reason. (Mt 22:41-45) By asking questions and then listening, we, in effect, say, ‘You are important to me.’ (Jas 1:19) The person’s answers may help us know how to direct the conversation better.

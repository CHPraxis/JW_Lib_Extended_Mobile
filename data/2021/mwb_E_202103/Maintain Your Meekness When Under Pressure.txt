TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Maintain Your Meekness When Under Pressure




Moses’ meekness was put to the test when he experienced pressure and stress (Nu 20:2-5; w19.02 12 ¶19)
Moses temporarily lost his meekness (Nu 20:10; w19.02 13 ¶20-21)
Jehovah disciplined Moses and Aaron for their serious mistake (Nu 20:12; w09 9/1 19 ¶5)
Meekness is a mildness of temper, without haughtiness or vanity. It enables one to endure injury with patience and without irritation, resentment, or retaliation.

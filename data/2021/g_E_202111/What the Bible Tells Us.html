<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>) With those words, the Bible summarizes its account of how our planet came to be. Does what the Bible says harmonize with scientific facts? Consider a few examples.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Up until the second half of the 20th century, many prominent scientists believed that the universe always existed. But based on more recent discoveries, most scientists now acknowledge that our universe did, in fact, have a beginning.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That description is echoed by modern scientific findings. Biologist Patrick Shih says that our planet started with “an unbreathable atmosphere devoid of oxygen . . . overall looking more like a science fiction landscape.” <em>Astronomy</em> magazine reports: “New research suggests ancient Earth was a water world, with little to no land in sight.”</p>

<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><strong>What Does the Bible <em>Not</em> Say?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some people claim that the Bible does not harmonize with modern scientific discovery. However, such claims are often based on a misunderstanding of what the Bible actually says.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>The Bible does not say that the universe or the earth is only 6,000 years old.</strong> Rather, it says simply that the earth and the universe were created “in the beginning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) The Bible does not specify how long ago that was.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>The Bible does not say that all life on earth was created in six <em>24-hour</em> days.</strong> Rather, it uses the word “day” to refer to periods of time. For example, it states that the creation of our planet and life on it​—during the six creative “days” spoken of in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:31" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 1</a>—​occurred in the period of time called “the <em>day</em> that Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>) So each of the six creative “days” during which God prepared the earth for life and created life on it could represent extremely long periods of time.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>The Bible does not say that living things cannot undergo changes in their makeup over time.</strong> The book of Genesis states that animals were created “according to their <em>kinds.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 1:24, 25</a>) The Bible word “kinds” is not a scientific term, but it seems to refer to broad divisions of life-forms. Thus, a single “kind” may include many species or varieties. This wording allows for the possibility that within a “kind,” changes in the variety and the types of species that lived in the same community could occur over time.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As noted above, the Bible describes in simple and accurate terms the beginning of the universe, the original state of the earth, and the development of life. Might it be, then, that the Bible has also accurately identified the One who created those things? “The origin of life [as] a result of a supernatural event,” says the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> “is in its most general form not inconsistent with contemporary scientific knowledge.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div id="p38" data-pid="38" class="boxTtl emphasized"><h2><strong>Consider this:</strong></h2></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sc">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:2:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1–2:4</a>. Contrast that account with ancient creation myths. The Babylonians, for example, believed that the universe and humans were made from the corpse of a goddess and the blood of a god. Ancient Egyptians supposed that the god Ra created humans from tears. In China, some thought that the dead body of a giant had transformed into the natural elements of the earth and that humans descended from the fleas on his body. Do you think that the Genesis account belongs among those myths? Or is it scientifically plausible?</p>

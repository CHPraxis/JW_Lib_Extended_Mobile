<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">“DON’T GIVE UP!” was the rousing theme of the 2017 regional convention program. The program showed us how we can bear up under the trials that befall us. Four years have passed since then, and here we are, still enduring life in this present system of things.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>What have you had to deal with recently? The loss of a family member or a dear friend? A life-threatening illness? The trials of getting older? A natural disaster, violence, or persecution? Or the effects of a disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic? How we yearn for the day when all of that will be behind us​—long forgotten and never to be repeated!​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:16-23:65:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 65:16, 17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Life in this system is hard, and we may be confronted with even more difficult challenges in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21</a>) Clearly, we need to continue to strengthen our endurance. Why? Because Jesus said: “By your endurance you will preserve your lives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:19-42:21:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:19</a>) Thinking about how others are successfully enduring trials similar to ours can strengthen our endurance.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why can we say that Jehovah is the best example of endurance?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Who is the best example of endurance? Jehovah God. Does that answer surprise you? It might until you think about it. This world is under the control of the Devil, and it is riddled with problems. Jehovah has the power to end it in an instant, but he is waiting for a future day to do that. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:22-45:9:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 9:22</a>) In the meantime, our God keeps on enduring until that appointed time arrives. Let us consider <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>nine things that Jehovah has chosen to endure.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup><em>The reproach brought on his name. </em></strong>Jehovah loves his name, and he wants everyone to respect it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 42:8</a>) But for some six millenniums, his good name has been reproached.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>) Ever since then, Jehovah has been falsely accused of depriving humans of what they truly need. Jesus was concerned about the reproach that was being heaped on his Father’s name. For that reason, he taught his disciples to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why has Jehovah allowed ample time to pass before settling the issue of his sovereignty?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>The opposition to his sovereignty. </em></strong>Jehovah has the absolute right to rule the heavens and the earth, and his way of ruling is the very best. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) But the Devil has tried to mislead angels and humans into thinking that God does not have that right. The issue of the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty could not be settled overnight. Wisely, God has allowed ample time for people to see that when humans try to rule themselves independently of the Creator, they are doomed to fail. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>) As a result of God’s patience, the issue will be settled once and for all. He will be vindicated as he proves that his Kingdom alone can establish real peace and security on earth.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup><em>The rebellion of some of his children. </em></strong>Jehovah created his spirit and human children perfect, without any flaws. But then the rebel angelic son Satan (meaning “Resister”) turned the perfect humans, Adam and Eve, against Jehovah. Other angels and humans joined in the rebellion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jude 6</a>) Later, even members of the nation of Israel, God’s chosen people, rejected him and turned to the worship of false gods. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:8-23:63:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 63:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:10-23:63:10" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Jehovah rightly felt betrayed. Still, he has endured, and he will keep on enduring until the time comes to put an end to all rebels.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 12:10</a>) We can do our part to prove that there is no truth to Satan’s lies by enduring our trials and remaining loyal to Jehovah out of love for Him.

How blasphemous! <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>We know better. When we are stricken with a serious illness or when someone we love dies, we never blame our God. On the contrary, we have faith that one day he will make things right.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Think of all the distressing problems that our heavenly Father has been enduring for thousands of years. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2021481/53-62">What Jehovah Is Enduring</a>.”) Jehovah could put an end to this wicked system of things at any time. But his patience has proved to be a blessing for us! We might think of it this way. Suppose a man and his wife are told that their unborn baby has serious physical problems and that the child will never have an easy life and will die prematurely. Even so, at great cost to themselves, the parents welcome the child’s birth. Their love for the child moves them to endure any hardship in order to provide him with the best possible quality of life.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>How does the description of Jesus recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2, 3</a> encourage us to keep on enduring?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Jehovah set the perfect example of endurance. Jesus succeeded in imitating his Father’s endurance. As a human, Jesus endured hostile speech, shame, and a torture stake for our sake. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 12:2, 3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah’s example of endurance undoubtedly gave Jesus the strength to endure. It can strengthen us too.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:9</a> help us to understand what Jehovah’s patience is accomplishing?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong>2 Peter 3:9</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jehovah knows the best time to end this wicked world. His patience has allowed for the gathering of a great crowd, numbering into the millions, who worship and praise him. All of them are glad that Jehovah has endured long enough for them to be born, to learn to love him, and to dedicate themselves to him. Jehovah’s decision to endure will be fully justified when he joyfully rewards the millions of us who have endured to the end!</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>19. </strong>What should we be determined to do, and what will be our reward?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>We learn from Jehovah how to endure with joy. Despite all the heartache and suffering Satan has caused, Jehovah remains “the happy God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11</a>) We can likewise remain joyful while we patiently wait for Jehovah to sanctify his name, vindicate his sovereignty, end all wickedness, and bring an end to our present problems. Let us be determined to endure and to take comfort in knowing that our heavenly Father is enduring too. If we do, these words will come true for each one of us: “Happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving Him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jas. 1:12</a>.</p>

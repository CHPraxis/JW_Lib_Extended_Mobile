<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">God created the earth so that righteous humans could live on it forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>) He put the first human couple, Adam and Eve, in the beautiful garden of Eden, and he gave them and their descendants the responsibility to cultivate the earth and to take care of it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Today’s world is far from the Paradise God meant it to be. However, God has not changed his mind. How will he fulfill his original purpose? As the preceding articles have shown, God will not destroy the earth itself. Rather, he will allow faithful humans to live on it. When God fulfills his promises, what will conditions on earth be like?</p>

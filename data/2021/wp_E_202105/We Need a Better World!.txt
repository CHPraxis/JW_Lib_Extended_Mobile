We Need a Better World!

“We are a world in turmoil,” stated António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations. Would you not agree?




The news is full of distressing reports
Disease and pandemics

Natural disasters

Poverty and hunger

Pollution and global warming

Crime, violence, and corruption

Wars


Clearly, we need a better world. A world where there is
Perfect health

Safety and security for everyone

Abundant food

A healthy environment

Justice for all

Global peace


What, though, do we mean when we speak of a better world?
What will happen to the world we live in now?
What can we do to live in a better world?
This issue of The Watchtower will explain the Bible’s comforting answers to these and related questions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some 3,500 years ago, Jehovah God told those who worshipped him what they must do to have a secure future: “I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the curse; and you must choose life so that you may live, you and your descendants.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To have a bright future, those people had to make the right choice. Today we have the same options. The Bible explains how to choose a secure future: “By <strong>loving Jehovah </strong>your God, by <strong>listening to his voice.”​</strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:20-5:30:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>LEARN FROM THE BIBLE: </strong>To love Jehovah, you first need to learn about him from the Bible. As you do, you will discover that he is a loving God who wants the best for you. He invites you to pray to him “because he cares for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>) The Bible promises that if you make the effort to get close to him, “he will draw close to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>APPLY WHAT YOU LEARN: </strong>To listen to God means to follow his wise guidance found in the Bible. As you do, “your way will be successful and then you will act wisely.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>.</p>

You Can Choose Your Future




Some 3,500 years ago, Jehovah God told those who worshipped him what they must do to have a secure future: “I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the curse; and you must choose life so that you may live, you and your descendants.”​—Deuteronomy 30:19.
To have a bright future, those people had to make the right choice. Today we have the same options. The Bible explains how to choose a secure future: “By loving Jehovah your God, by listening to his voice.”​—Deuteronomy 30:20.



HOW CAN WE LOVE JEHOVAH AND LISTEN TO HIS VOICE?

LEARN FROM THE BIBLE: To love Jehovah, you first need to learn about him from the Bible. As you do, you will discover that he is a loving God who wants the best for you. He invites you to pray to him “because he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7) The Bible promises that if you make the effort to get close to him, “he will draw close to you.”​—James 4:8.
APPLY WHAT YOU LEARN: To listen to God means to follow his wise guidance found in the Bible. As you do, “your way will be successful and then you will act wisely.”​—Joshua 1:8.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As discussed in the preceding articles, people have tried to find a better future by putting their trust in such things as fate, education, wealth, and being a good person. Taking these approaches, however, is like using a faulty map to get to a destination. Does that mean there is no reliable guide for the future? No!</p>

<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>GUIDANCE FROM A SUPERIOR SOURCE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When making decisions, we usually consult someone who is older and wiser than we are. In a similar way, we can find sound guidance for our future from a Source who is far older and wiser than we are. The counsel from this One has come to us in a collection of sacred writings that began to be produced about 3,500 years ago. This collection of holy writings is a book called the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why can you trust the Bible? Because its Author is the oldest and wisest Person in the universe. He is described as “the Ancient of Days” who is “from everlasting to everlasting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Psalm 90:2</a>) He is “the Creator of the heavens, the true God, the One who formed the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>) He identifies himself by his personal name, Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because the Bible is from the Creator of all mankind, it does not favor one culture or race over another. Its counsel is timeless and has benefited people in all lands. It is available in more languages and has been more widely distributed than any other book.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> This means that people everywhere can easily understand it and be guided by it. These facts support the Bible’s own statement:</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>“God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>ACTS 10:34, 35</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Just as a caring parent provides guidance for his children, Jehovah God is a loving Father who offers us help through his Word, the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) You can trust his Word; after all, he made us and knows what course of life is best for us.</p>

</div><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se"><strong>EVENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>LUKE 21:10, 11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se"><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc"><strong>“In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>2 TIMOTHY 3:1-4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
</div><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se">What do you conclude when you see that the Bible so long ago accurately described what is happening today? No doubt you will agree with Leung, from Hong Kong, who says: “Bible prophecies were written long ago. It is impossible for any human to have predicted these things so accurately. The Bible has to be inspired by someone far superior to us.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="se">The Bible contains hundreds of prophecies that have been fulfilled.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> These prove that the Bible really is God’s Word. “I am God, and there is no one like me,” says Jehovah. “From the beginning I foretell the outcome.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:9, 10</a>) With good reason, therefore, you can rely on what the Bible says about the future.</p>

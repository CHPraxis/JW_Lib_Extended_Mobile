<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>What effect did a talk delivered at a convention in 1935 have on one young man?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">THE young man was 18 years old when he got baptized in 1926. His parents were Bible Students, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were known at the time. They had three sons and two daughters, whom they raised to serve Jehovah God and imitate Jesus Christ. As was true of all Bible Students back then, this sincere young man partook of the bread and the wine each year at the Lord’s Evening Meal. However, his entire outlook on life was changed by a history-making talk entitled “The Great Multitude.” That talk was given in 1935 by J. F. Rutherford at a convention in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. What was revealed at that convention?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What exciting truth was revealed in Brother Rutherford’s talk?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>In his talk, Brother Rutherford identified those who would make up the “great multitude” (<em>King James Version</em>), or “great crowd,” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9</a>. Until then, this group was thought to be a secondary heavenly class that was less faithful. Brother Rutherford used the Scriptures to explain that the great crowd are not chosen to live in heaven, but they are Christ’s other sheep<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> who will survive “the great tribulation” and live <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>forever on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 7:14</a>) Jesus promised: “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) These sheeplike ones are loyal Witnesses of Jehovah who have the prospect of living forever in Paradise on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 46</a>) Let us see how this flash of spiritual light changed the lives of many of Jehovah’s people, including that 18-year-old brother.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:11-19:97:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 97:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 4:18</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>3-4. </strong>At the 1935 convention, what did thousands realize about their hope, and why?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>A thrilling moment at that convention came when the speaker asked the audience: “Will all those who have the hope of living forever on the earth please stand?” According to an eyewitness, over half of the some 20,000 people in the audience stood. Then Brother Rutherford declared: “Behold! The great multitude!” That was followed by thunderous cheering. Those who stood realized that they were not chosen for heavenly life. They knew that they had not been anointed by God’s spirit. On the next day of the convention, 840 new Witnesses got baptized, most of whom were of the other sheep.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>After that talk, the young man mentioned earlier and thousands of others rightly stopped partaking of the bread and the wine at the Lord’s Evening Meal. One brother humbly expressed the feelings of many when he said: “The Memorial of 1935 was the last time that I partook of the emblems. I realized that the heavenly hope had not been awakened within me by Jehovah through his holy spirit; rather, I had the hope to live on the earth and to share in the work of making it a paradise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:16-45:8:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 8:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 1:21, 22</a>) Since then, those of the great crowd have increased in number and have been working side by side with the anointed remnant.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How does Jehovah view those who have stopped partaking of the Memorial emblems?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How does Jehovah view those who stopped partaking of the Memorial emblems after 1935? And what if a baptized Witness today sincerely partakes of the bread and the wine at the Lord’s Evening Meal but later realizes that he or she is not truly anointed? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:28-46:11:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:28</a>) Some have partaken of the emblems because they misunderstood their hope. But if they honestly acknowledge their mistake, stop partaking, and continue faithfully serving Jehovah, he will surely count them among the other sheep. Even though they do not partake of the bread and the wine, they still attend the Memorial because they deeply appreciate what Jehovah and Jesus have done for them.</p>

Jesus commands the angels to continue holding back the four winds of destruction. They are not to unleash those winds on the earth until all anointed Christians have been sealed, that is, finally approved by Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1-4</a>) As a reward for their faithfulness, Christ’s anointed brothers become kings and priests with him in heaven.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>After telling about these 144,000 kings and priests, John sees something exciting, “a great crowd” who survive Armageddon. Unlike the first group, this second group is much larger and has no fixed number. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 7:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>They are “dressed in white robes,” indicating that they have kept themselves “without spot” from Satan’s world and have remained loyal to God and Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>) They cry out that they have been saved because of what Jehovah and Jesus, the Lamb of God, have done. All the while, they are holding palm branches, which shows that they joyfully acknowledge Jesus as Jehovah’s appointed King.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:12-43:12:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 12:12, 13</a>.</p>

John sees all of Jehovah’s heavenly family filled with joy as those of the great crowd appear and praise God. Jehovah’s heavenly family will be delighted to see the fulfillment of this vision when the great crowd come out of the great tribulation alive.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:13-66:7:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Revelation 7:13-15</a>, what are those of the great crowd doing now?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18</a>) They are dedicated, baptized Christians, who exercise strong faith in Jesus’ sacrifice and who have a relationship with Jehovah.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:16-66:7:17" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 7:16, 17</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Right <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>now, some of Jehovah’s people are suffering physical hunger because of oppressive economic conditions or as a result of the ravages of civil unrest and war. Others are imprisoned for their faith. However, those of the great crowd are thrilled to know that on escaping the destruction of this wicked system of things, they will always have an abundance of physical and spiritual food. When destruction is unleashed on Satan’s system of things, the great crowd will be spared the “scorching heat” of Jehovah’s anger that he will pour out on the nations. After the great tribulation ends, Jesus will guide these earthly survivors to the “waters of [everlasting] life.” Just think: The great crowd have a unique prospect. Of all the billions who have ever lived, they may never die!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:26-43:11:26" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 11:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The other sheep have a marvelous hope for which they are thankful to Jehovah and Jesus! They were not chosen for heavenly life, but they are in no way less precious, or less valuable, to Jehovah. Members of both groups can praise God and Christ.

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>13-14. </strong>Why should everyone attend the Memorial of Christ’s death?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In recent years, approximately 1 out of every 1,000 who attend the Memorial partakes of the bread and the wine. Most congregations do not have any partakers in attendance. The vast majority who attend the Memorial have the earthly hope. Why, then, do they attend the Lord’s Evening Meal? They attend for the same reason that people attend a friend’s wedding. They attend because they want to show their love and support for the couple who are getting married. Thus, those of the other sheep attend the Memorial because they want to show their love and support for Christ and the anointed. The other sheep also attend to show their appreciation for the sacrifice that the Memorial commemorates, a <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>sacrifice that makes it possible for them to live forever on earth.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Another important reason why the other sheep attend the Memorial is in order to be obedient to Jesus’ command. When Jesus instituted that special meal with his faithful apostles, he told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:23-26</a>) So they continue to attend the Lord’s Evening Meal as long as some anointed ones are alive here on earth. In fact, the other sheep invite everyone to attend the Memorial with them.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>How can we personally praise God and Christ at the Memorial?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>At the Memorial, we have the opportunity to praise God and Christ in song and prayer. The talk that will be given this year is “Appreciate What God and Christ Have Done for You!” It will deepen our gratitude for Jehovah and Christ. As the emblems are being passed, those of us in attendance will be reminded of what they symbolize​—Jesus’ body and his blood. We will recall that Jehovah allowed his Son to die in our place so that we could have life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28</a>) Everyone who loves our heavenly Father and his Son will want to attend the Memorial.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The difference between the anointed and the other sheep is not their value to God. Both groups are equally precious to him. After all, he paid the same price, the life of his dear Son, to purchase both the anointed and the other sheep. The difference between the two groups is that they have different hopes. Both groups must remain loyal to God and Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:23-19:31:23" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23</a>) And remember, God’s spirit can work with equal force on all of us.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup><em>Anointed Christians </em></strong>are not born with the heavenly hope. It has to be implanted in their heart by God. They think about their hope, pray about it, and are eager to receive their reward in heaven. They cannot even imagine what their spiritual body will be like.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 65:21-23</a>) They look forward to exploring the earth​—its mountains, forests, and seas—​and to studying Jehovah’s abundant creation.

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>19. </strong>What opportunity does the Memorial give each of us, and when will the Memorial be held this year?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jehovah has given each of his dedicated servants a wonderful hope for the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jer. 29:11</a>) The Memorial of Christ’s death gives each of us a grand opportunity to praise God and Christ for what they have done for us so that we can enjoy unending life. The Memorial is without question the most important occasion for true Christians to meet together. It will be held after sundown on <strong>Saturday, March 27, 2021. </strong>This year many will be able to attend this important occasion in relative freedom. Others will attend despite opposition.

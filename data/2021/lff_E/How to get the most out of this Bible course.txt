How to find Bible verses
The Bible is a collection of 66 smaller books. It is divided into two sections: the Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures (“Old Testament”) and the Christian Greek Scriptures (“New Testament”).
When a scripture is cited in this course, it is indicated by the name of the Bible book (A), followed by the chapter (B), and the verse or verses (C).
For example, John 17:3 refers to the book of John, chapter 17, verse 3.

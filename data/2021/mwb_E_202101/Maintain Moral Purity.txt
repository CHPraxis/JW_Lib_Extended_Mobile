TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Maintain Moral Purity




Jehovah expects us to behave differently from people in the world (Le 18:3; w19.06 28 ¶1)
Jehovah forbids such sins as incest, homosexuality, and bestiality (Le 18:6, 22, 23; w17.02 20 ¶13)
Jehovah will destroy the unclean world around us (Le 18:24, 25; Pr 2:22; w14 7/1 7 ¶2)
Satan does not want us to enter God’s new world. But Jehovah’s principles can protect us from any satanic trap.
How can we show Jehovah that we hate immorality?

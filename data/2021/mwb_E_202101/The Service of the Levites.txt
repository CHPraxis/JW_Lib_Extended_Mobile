TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
The Service of the Levites




Jehovah took the Levites in place of the firstborn males of Israel (Nu 3:11-13; it-2 683 ¶3)
The Levites enjoyed precious privileges (Nu 3:25, 26, 31, 36, 37; it-2 241)
The Levites cared for their full duties between 30 and 50 years of age (Nu 4:46-48; it-2 241)
The males in Aaron’s family performed priestly duties. The rest of the Levites assisted them. Likewise, in the Christian congregation today, some responsible men care for weighty spiritual concerns, while others care for necessary routine matters.

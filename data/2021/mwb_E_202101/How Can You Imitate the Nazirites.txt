How Can You Imitate the Nazirites?




Nazirites practiced self-denial (Nu 6:2-4; it-2 477)
Nazirites were submissive to Jehovah’s will (Nu 6:5)
Nazirites remained clean before Jehovah (Nu 6:6, 7)
Full-time servants today show a spirit of self-sacrifice and submission to Jehovah and his arrangements.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Co 5:14, 15</a>) During March and April, auxiliary pioneers may choose a 30- or 50-hour requirement. If you are able to participate in this special activity, submit an application to the Congregation Service Committee. Each month, the names of those approved to serve as auxiliary pioneers will be announced to the congregation. In this way, the congregation can support the pioneers in the ministry. May all of us take full advantage of opportunities during the Memorial season to sharpen our preaching skills and to encourage one another.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Th 5:11</a>.</p>

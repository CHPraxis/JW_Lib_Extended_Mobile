TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Organizes His People




[Play the video Introduction to Numbers.]
The Israelites camped according to three-tribe divisions (Nu 1:52, 53; w94 12/1 9 ¶4)
The Israelite camp may have totaled 3,000,000 or more (Nu 2:32, 33; it-1 397 ¶4)
Jehovah wants his people to worship him in an organized way. That was true for the nation of Israel, and it is true for us today.​—1Co 14:33, 40.





ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I show my complete support for Jehovah’s organization?’

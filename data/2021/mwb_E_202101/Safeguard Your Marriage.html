<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah views marriage vows very seriously. He said a husband and a wife must stick to each other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:5-40:19:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 19:5, 6</a>) There are many exemplary marriages among God’s people. However, no marriage is perfect. Problems do arise. We must not adopt the common view that separation and divorce are the answer when a couple is having problems. How can married Christians safeguard their marriage?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider five important steps.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sm">              Guard your heart by rejecting such things as flirting and immoral entertainment, which only weaken a marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:28-40:5:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 5:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:14-61:2:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Pe 2:14</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sm">               Continue putting on the new personality, and perform little acts of kindness that will make your mate’s life a bit easier.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col 3:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12-14</a>.</p>

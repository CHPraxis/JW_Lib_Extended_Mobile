<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Why do we enjoy our annual conventions so much? As in ancient Israel, conventions in our day often give us the opportunity to worship Jehovah with hundreds, even thousands, of fellow believers. We enjoy the banquet of rich spiritual food. We also treasure the precious time we spend with friends and family. Our deep appreciation moves us to attend all three days of the convention.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When we have occasion to gather together, we should think not only about what we can gain personally but also about how we can show love to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ga 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb 10:24, 25</a>) When we hold a door open for our brother or sister or save only the seats we will need, we show that we are looking out for the interests of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Php 2:3, 4</a>) Conventions provide wonderful opportunities for us to make new friends. Before and after the program and during the lunch break, we can make it a point to get acquainted with someone we do not know. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:13-47:6:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Co 6:13</a>) The friendships we develop on these occasions can last a lifetime! Above all, when onlookers see true love in action, they may decide to join us in serving Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 13:35</a>.</p>

Where are you on the road to baptism?





LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Choose to Serve Jehovah




If you are a Christian youth or a Bible student, do you have the goal of baptism? Why should you want to get baptized? Dedication and baptism result in a special relationship with Jehovah. (Ps 91:1) They also lead to salvation. (1Pe 3:21) How can you progress to these steps?
Prove to yourself that this is the truth. When questions come to your mind, do personal research. (Ro 12:2) Identify any changes you need to make, and follow through out of a desire to please Jehovah. (Pr 27:11; Eph 4:23, 24) Always pray to him for help. Be assured that Jehovah will strengthen and support you with his powerful holy spirit. (1Pe 5:10, 11) The effort you put forth is well worth it. Serving Jehovah is the best way of life!​—Ps 16:11.

At the conclusion of the baptism talk, the speaker will ask the baptism candidates to stand and answer the following two questions in a loud voice:
Have you repented of your sins, dedicated yourself to Jehovah, and accepted his way of salvation through Jesus Christ?
Do you understand that your baptism identifies you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in association with Jehovah’s organization?
Affirmative answers to these questions constitute a “public declaration” that baptism candidates have put faith in the ransom and have unreservedly dedicated themselves to Jehovah.​—Ro 10:9, 10.

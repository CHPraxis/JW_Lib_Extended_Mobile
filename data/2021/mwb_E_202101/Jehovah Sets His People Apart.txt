TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Jehovah Sets His People Apart




We must obey all of Jehovah’s laws (Le 20:22, 23; w04 10/15 11 ¶12)
Jehovah promises an inheritance (Le 20:24; it-1 1199)
Jehovah expects clean worship from his people (Le 20:25, 26; it-1 317 ¶2)
Jehovah blesses those who maintain a good relationship with him. To preserve his favor, we must remain separate from the world around us and its unclean practices.





ASK YOURSELF, ‘What medical practices should I avoid that are displeasing to God?’

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Organized to Preach to Everyone




Just as Jehovah organized the Israelites, he organizes his people today to do his will. Around the world, branch offices, circuits, congregations, and field service groups all function to further the preaching of the good news. We preach to everyone, including those who speak another language.​—Re 14:6, 7.
Have you considered learning another language in order to help someone learn the truth? Even if you cannot devote the time needed to learn a language, you can use the JW Language app to learn a simple presentation. Then, after using it in the ministry, you may experience the same joy that our first-century brothers had when people from other lands were amazed to hear “the magnificent things of God” in their own language.​—Ac 2:7-11.

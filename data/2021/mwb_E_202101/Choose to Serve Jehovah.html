<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you are a Christian youth or a Bible student, do you have the goal of baptism? Why should you want to get baptized? Dedication and baptism result in a special relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:1-19:91:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 91:1</a>) They also lead to salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Pe 3:21</a>) How can you progress to these steps?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Prove to yourself that this is the truth. When questions come to your mind, do personal research. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 12:2</a>) Identify any changes you need to make, and follow through out of a desire to please Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 27:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:24" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eph 4:23, 24</a>) Always pray to him for help. Be assured that Jehovah will strengthen and support you with his powerful holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Pe 5:10, 11</a>) The effort you put forth is well worth it. Serving Jehovah is the best way of life!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:11-19:16:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 16:11</a>.</p>

<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sw"><em>Have you repented of your sins, dedicated yourself to Jehovah, and accepted his way of salvation through Jesus Christ?</em></p>

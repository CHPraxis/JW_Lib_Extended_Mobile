Israelite slaves return to their family and land during the Jubilee





TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
The Jubilee Year and Future Liberty




The Jubilee year helped to prevent endless debt and poverty in Israel (Le 25:10; it-1 871; see cover picture)
The sale of land was essentially a lease based on the value of crops the land would produce (Le 25:15; it-1 1200 ¶2)
Jehovah blessed his people when they obeyed the law of the Jubilee year (Le 25:18-22; it-2 122-123)
In the near future, faithful humans will enjoy the full benefits of the symbolic Jubilee when they are completely liberated from sin and death.​—Ro 8:21.





What must each of us do to receive the freedom that Jehovah has promised?

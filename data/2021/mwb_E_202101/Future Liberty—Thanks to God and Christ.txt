LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Future Liberty​—Thanks to God and Christ




What are your daily struggles? Are you a family head juggling many responsibilities? Are you a single parent trying hard to make ends meet? Are you a young one in school who faces harassment from peers? Are you dealing with poor health or the effects of advanced age? Everyone is dealing with something. Many Christians are dealing with multiple trials at the same time. Yet, we know that we will soon be liberated from these trials.​—2Co 4:16-18.
Until then, we find comfort in knowing that Jehovah understands our struggles, appreciates our loyalty and endurance, and has grand blessings in store for us. (Jer 29:11, 12) Jesus too is personally interested in us. As we fulfill our Christian obligations, we have his assurance: “I am with you.” (Mt 28:20) When we stop and meditate on future liberty under God’s Kingdom, we strengthen our hope and our determination to endure present trials.​—Ro 8:19-21.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:20-23:5:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 5:20</a>) Sadly, some people do things that Jehovah hates, including improper conduct between those of the same sex. Peers at school or others may try to entice our precious young ones to follow their lead. How can you prepare your children to face this and similar tests successfully?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Equip your children with knowledge of Jehovah’s standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:3-3:18:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 18:3</a>) Progressively share age-appropriate information with them about what the Bible says is proper sexual conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">De 6:7</a>) Ask yourself: ‘Have I taught my children about proper displays of affection, the importance of wearing modest clothing, and the need for others to respect their privacy? Would my children know what to do if someone tried to show them pornography or asked them to do something Jehovah says is wrong?’ Advance knowledge can help them to avoid calamity.

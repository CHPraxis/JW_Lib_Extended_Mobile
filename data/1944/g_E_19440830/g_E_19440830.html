<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It has been reported that the Bible Students in Germany are ‘ringleaders of prayer and study groups' and subject to Gestapo raids. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Monitor,</span><span class="font10"> published in Boston, Massachusetts, revealed in its issue of June 29, 1943, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The arrests seem to have been made chiefly among working folk, among whom this religious movement is most widespread. One newspaper spoke of the arrest of a smith, a butcher, a baker, a teamster, and a wood chopper, all of whom seemed earnest adherents of the sect’s teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These simple folk seem most .firm in their faith. Recently, seven of them were executed. The executions were marked by the unusual sight of the condemned men’s wives begging them not to sign a renunciation of their faith which might have brought them a pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They are growing up like mushrooms,&quot; is an expression frequently heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a radio broadcast of a few months ago-it was stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before Rudolph Hess made his still rather mysterious flight to England, it was his task to suppress these Bible Students [speaking of Germany]—rather as in Biblical days Paul delighted in persecuting the Christians, until his sudden change and acceptance of Christianity. But since Hess left Germany the increasingly irritated Nazis have found no one who can cope with this secret religious group. True, they have just arrested a number of its adherents in the Black Forest region and elsewhere, but they have found no way to shake the faith of the unassuming working folk mainly involved. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">large number of Germans who are not sympathetic with the Bible Students themselves, however, do not approve of Nazi tactics of suppression. They are inclined to defend the members of the group as martyrs for conscience, and to believe that the arrests and executions are a sign of Germany’s rapid progress toward the abyss.</span></p>

August 30, 1944 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 651</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The President in Time of War</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font10">RESIDENT ROOSEVELT has a hard job and stands up to it man, fully. Most of his critics would fall in a heap if they tried to do half his work. And he has a kindly heart, too, and a sense of justice and benevolence. At Elizabeth, Pa., is a boy who was born with deformed feet. His parents could not afford the operation necessary to make them normal. When the boy got to be 12 he wrote to the president about it, and the president did the fine thing. He got the Children’s Hospital, in Pittsburgh, to take the boy in and perform the operation. They did, and now he skates, swims, walks and dances like other boys. And everybody is glad, from the president down to the boy inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No man can keep up a personal correspondence with 130,000,000 people, and probably the president did not see the letter written to him by one of Jehovah’s little witnesses, Lorraine Connell, of Lodge Forest school, Sparrows Point, Md. She wrote to him direct, explaining that she and her brother had been expelled because of their conscientious stand on the flag salute question. She asked him, “Isn’t there a way that I can love and serve the Lord and continue my education as well?” She was referred back to the state authorities. But if he had seen the letter and taken a courageous poke at this new-fangled flagwaving hysteria, he would have done a lot to bring some Americans back to their senses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He stood up for the alien workers in A-l shape. What American can fail to thrill at this, his rebuke to the narrowminded :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am deeply concerned over the increasing number of reports of employers discharging workers who happen to be aliens or even foreign-bom citizens. This is a very serious matter. It is one thing to safeguard American industry, and particularly defense industry, against sabotage; but it is very much another to throw out of work honest and loyal people who, except for the accident of birth, are sincerely patriotic. Such a policy is as stupid as it is unjust, and on both counts it plays into the hands of the enemies of American democracy..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the bicentennial of the birth of Thomas Jefferson, he drew the attention of all to the words of the “Sage of Monticello” :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Proposed New &quot;Bill of Rights”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The president has proposed a new Bill of Rights which may be briefly stated as (1) the right to work, (2) the' right to adequate pay and (3) food, clothing, shelter and medical care; (4) the right to social security, (5) the right to live in a system of free enterprise, (6) the right to come, to go, to speak, to be silent, (7) the right to equality before the law, (8) the right to education, and (9) the right to rest, recreation and adventure. Those are all good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Atlantic Charter is an imaginary thing, because, theoretically, the American people are the lawmakers, not the president, but it voiced a high ideal when the president himself said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All states, great and small, victor or vanquished, must have access on equal terms, to the trade and to the' raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">X The president recognizes the burdens * that rest upon the poor. In one of his messages, not generally quoted in the press, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is too easy to act on the assumption that all consumers have surplus purchasing power and that the high earnings of some workers in munitions plants are enjoyed by every worker’s family. This easy assumption overlooks the 4,000,000 wage workers still earning less than 40 cents an hour, and millions of others whose incomes are almost as low. It ignores the fact that more than 4,000,000 families have not had an increase of more than 5 percent in their income during the last 18 months. It further ignores the millions of salaried, white-collar workers whose salaries have remained low, but whose living standards are being cruelly and inequitably slashed by higher food prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Swift, Aggressive, Powerful</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roosevelts (Theodore was uncle of Eleanor, and fifth cousin of Franklin Delano) think and act with incredible speed; they are aggressive; they understand human nature, and they have been entrusted with more power than any other White House occupants ever had. If anyone thinks he can gain anything by the claim that the family originated with the Rossoeampo (Jewish) family expelled from Spain in 1620, and that their name has been in turn van Rosen-velt and Roosevelt, let him go right ahead and receive in return the contempt he deserves. God “hath made of one blood all nations of men” (Acts 17: 26), and in America there is the greatest mixture of races and peoples found on the face of the earth. There are plenty of people not slow to say that the real reason for America’s astounding productive power lies in that very mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But Eleanor slipped when sh^re-ferred to the president as the “elected ruler”, and the newspapers reminded her of it right away. In America the people rule, and their most honored servant is their president, their chief executive, the commander in chief of their army and navy, but not their ruler; not by a long shot. Eleanor has the family traits. Like her husband she is progressive and aggressive. She suggested family restaurants, family laundries, day nurseries, and the transportation to school of the older children, so as to lighten the burdens of the women engaged in war industries. This would pretty nearly dispose of the home, but perhaps it is the best that can be done for such workers and their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That President Roosevelt himself is to the last degree swift, aggressive and resourceful is well stated in the following, taken from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font10"> Vol. 19, p. 536:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 99-day session of the 73rd Congress which began March 9,1933, witnessed the most daring presidential leadership in American 'history. Congress, dazed and planless, found itself subjected to a carefully timed bombardment of bills. Mr. Roosevelt sent a rapid succession of presidential messages, sufficiently spaced to avoid confusion; followed each message by a bill to implement it; and thus dealt with the agricultural crisis, banking crisis, relief crisis, and a dozen other problems with amazing speed. The fact that Congress was passing laws to order was never concealed ... In a time when conflict of opinion was violent, his way of zigzagging between “right” and ‘left” perhaps gave him a maximum of public support. ... A political precedent as old as the republic was broken July 18, 1940, when Mr. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democrats for a third term. [And now,<sub>x </sub>July 20, 1944, for a fourth term.—£d.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Congress Almost Abdicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fifty-five years ago, in the second volume of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font10"> the first president of this Society (page 263) suggested that &quot;it would not be surprising if a ‘strong government’, a monarchy, would some day replace this present Great Republic”; and there are some who seem to think that goal has almost been attained by President Roosevelt. One of his bitterest critics, the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font10"> in an editorial entitled “Unlimited Autocracy”, put it this way:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Ameriean system of representative government is at the present moment only an empty shell out of which a fully organized system of autocracy, controlled by one man, has grown. This autocracy already is as absolute as any in Europe. We have found, just as the Germans found, that a national legislature can vote away protections and guarantees and thereafter be unable to regain them. In reality our Congress has abdicated. Mr. Roosevelt by deertie and executive order can take over the industrial plant of the country. By penalties and subsidies he can control agriculture. He can say how the resources of the country shall hip used. He can decree who may obtain materials and who may not. He can close a factory premises. He can fix prices. He can take a plant over if the management doesn’t obey him or doesn’t satisfy his demands on it. He can order the search of private premises. He can draft men. He can control communications. He is the absolute master of shipping. He can curtail the manufacture of consumers’ goods and deprive citizens of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foregoing was printed in the spring of 1941.,.before America entered the war. Since then the president’s powers have been greatly increased. There are now at least 1.72 acts of Congress (the people) granting the president special powers. Of these, 11.4 grant him specific additional powers in times of emergency, and the remaining 58 specifically broaden his power in time of war. In actual practice, in wartime, the president’s powers are without limit or definition, other than that he is commander in chief of the army and navy and of the militia of the several 'states when called into actual service of the country as a whole. The state of war now existent automatically makes President Roosevelt a potentially complete dictator, with a power over capital, labor, the press, the radio and private individuals such as no other president has ever had, and in the full exercise of Which powers he is now showing Mr. Hitler that he is merely a beginner at getting things done. The row about patting Mr. Avery, of Montgomery Ward &amp;&nbsp;Company,. out on the sidewalk was a mere circumstance, and actually amounted to nothing at all. The Louisville </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">CourierJournal,</span><span class="font10"> reviewing the whole incident, said, “It is difficult to see how the president could have acted otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rush Toward Totalitarianism</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rush toward totalitarianism is on, all over the earth, and it is hopeless to attempt to halt it, but one may stand aside and look at it. And it is not a pleasant thing to see. Here is how the Newport News </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font10"> puts it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of flic columnists and commentators are awakening to the fact that democracy appears to be on the way out in the United States. One group complains that the president wants too much power, and another that Congress makes too much of a habit of legislating for special interests. Why, we wonder, have these gentlemen been so tardy in awakening to what was going on. The president tipped his hand with the New Deal and with his demand for power to pack the Supreme Court. Congress has been tipping its hand every time any special interest with votes behind it demanded special treatment. As far back as dune, 1937, Walter Lippmann said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I fee), let us hope mistakenly, that he (President Roosevelt) really does have a plan and that he is determined to execute it. It is a plan, as I see it, to gather together an irresistible power over the economic life of this country and to consolidate the power in the; hands of his own following. The desire, of the president to assume control of the economic life of the nation was manifested long before 1937. And some of his New Deal boys talked out of turn in the early days of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the New Dea] and openly admitted that the Administration was desirous of socializing the country. The war has resulted in the president’s being given more powers than any other president ever had. He is virtually a dictator—so much so that he recently ' threatened to abrogate an act of Congress unless his demands for anti-inflation legislation were met. There have been vast changes I in our economic and political structures dur* ing the past ten years or so. And at the end of the War democracy as we have known it since this nation was founded will be a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you read after Ray Tucker or Harry Hopkins you know that the president can now place munition contracts with “any individual, firm, association, company, corporation or organized manufacturing industry” with a penalty of three years in prison and $10,000 fine for refusal to comply. And according to Hopkins it may come to it shortly that any man can be sent anywhere; train rides, telegrams and telephone calls will be restricted; high school courses shortened ; the jobless must go to work; people with spare rooms will have to rent them; there will be few goods in cans; shoes and clothing will be standardized ; home conveniences and machinery will cease; mails' may be delivered but once a day; domestic servants will be.a luxury; all metal and rubber goods must be surrendered; etc. Some of these things have come to pass since he wrote, in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Four Milestones</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a'pretty raw picture of the president that United States Senator Harry F. Byrd, of Virginia, presents in his paper entitled “Four Milestones to Totalitarianism”. He says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For ten years now, the U. S. has been alternately cajoled, threatened, wheedled, promised and finally pushed down the path to dictatorship. The first milestone was the control of government. He [the president] first attempted to “pack” the U. S. Supreme Court by increasing the membership with new appointments. He asked for the abolition of the comptroller general, the government’s only independent auditing office; sought control over the Civil Service Commission, which, in effect, would have endangered our entire merit system. As every one knows, the real power of Congress over.the executive departments is the control of the purse, the power to give or to deny appropriations. The New Deal has overcome this handicap by creating government corporations which, once a blanket authorization has been secured, are allowed to issue bonds and disburse public funds as the president sees fit. There are 57 of these corporations [this seems a modest statement; there seem to be 104, with initials as follows: AAA, AMA, AOA, BCD, BEW, BIRT, BP A, BWC, CAA, CCC (1), CCC (2), CCS, CEA, CES, CFB, CMB, CPA, CPRB, CRMB, CSAB, CWA, DLC, DPC, DSC, EHFA, EIBW, EPCA, FCA, FCC, FCIC, FDIC, FFC, FHA, FIC, FNMA, FPA, FPHA, FRC, FREB, FSA (1), FSA (2), FSCC, FWA, HOLC, LOPM, MRC, NAC, NHA, NTIfC, NIC, NIRA, NIRB, NMB, NPPC, NRA, NRPB, NWLB, NYA, OBCCC, OC, OCD, OCIAA, ODHWS, ODT, OEM, OES, OLLA, OPA, OPCW, OSRD, OWI, PAW, PCD, P1WC, PRA, PRP, PRRA, PWA, PWRCB, RA, RACC, REA, RRB, RRC, SA, SCS, SEC, SMA, SSB, SSS, SWPC, TNA, TV A, UNRRA, USES, USHA, USMC, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wdc, wepl, wmc, wpa, wpb, </span><span class="font8">WRA, WSA—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.],</span><span class="font8"> and the $30,000,000,000 which they have spent, many times involving important controversial appropriations, has never been authorized by Congress. It has never even been audited by the comptroller general. Supplementing this detour of legislative authorization, the president has resorted to another method of executive lawmaking, that of executive order. In 10 years he has issued 3,490 executive orders, many of legislative or quasi-] egislative content. These are not laws passed by Congress; they are laws passed by a single bureaucrat. Nor is this all. In the stress of the national crisis, the president was granted an emergency fund of over $500,000,000. While only a small portion of this sum has been spent, all of it has been allocated to various agencies. In effect, it places tremendous power in the hands of the president, power which the Constitution, formerly reserved to the Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The second milestone was the control of business. In the past three years, the government has spent $25,000,000,000 in building plants and facilities for industrial production. There is not a single field of private endeavor in the whole country that is not tethered to the post of administrative directive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The third milestone was control of food, the creating of federal agricultural bureaus and agencies which are competing with private enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fourth milestone was control of the people. It is axiomatic that if control can be established over the shape of the ideas which go into a man’s head and the amount of money which Hows into his pocket, there is little to fear what will come out of his mouth. In just these ways totalitarianism is being foisted on the people of America. The number as well as the shape of these ideas may soon be rationed if the propaganda specialists have their way. The creation of OWI was a step in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Too Much Bureaucracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a politician gets into a good government job it is natural for him to want to stay there, to bring in his friends and to pay them well. When they get inside of some one of the 104 bureaus, they start to do the same thing. Their motto is always more workers and more money. President Roosevelt condemns this. Shortly before he was elected in 1932 he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I accuse the present [Hoover] administration of being the greatest spending administration in all our history. One which has piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission. Bureaus and bureaucrats have been retained at the expense of the taxpayers. The people in America demand a reduction of federal expenditure. It can be accomplished by reducing the expenditures of existing departments, by abolishing many useless commissions, bureaus and functions, and by consolidating many activities of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Writing on this subject, and in full harmony with the president’s own ideas as above expressed, Mr. E. M. Biggers, printer, 100 Sabine street, Houston 10, Texas, said in his letter to a southern congressman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been my information that no two of these bureaucrats have ever been able to agree on how they want anything handled. An attempt was made to liquidate the NYA. The War Manpower Commission was created with McNutt in charge, and, according to newspaper reports, the first thing he<sup>-</sup>did was to piek up the NYA bodily and carry it over to the new board—not a day lost, not a cent saved the taxpayers; another board took care of the faithful 1 We see every day where some defeated New Dealer is placed in a betterpaying government job than his home'voters ousted him from. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I would prefer a system that allowed me to buy that for which I did not have the money to pay, to a system that forbade me to buy that for which I did have the money to pay. I object to regimentation; object to being ruled by a bunch of fan-tailed theorists who are attacking everything that has made America .great, even the geography, the calendar, the clock, and the unchangeable law of supply and demand. It is easy to rebuild our lost fortunes, but liberties and human rights once taken away arc not easily recaptured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I note you arc chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, and as I have been long active in that line, am making some observations: I objected then and I object now to the slaughtering of some 6,200,000 pigs; hundreds of thousands of brood sows; more than 800,000 dairy cows, not even allowing the hides to be saved because that would lower the price of leather, when at that time shoes were so high most people could not afford a new pair. I objected to destroying hundreds of thousands of acres of growing farm products, the essentials and-necessities of life. Somehow I feel that God will punish those who do such foolish things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I protested to our congressman when two new' post offices were erected in this county— right in the midst of cheap gas, cheap and abundant fuel oil—and the heating plants were designed and installed requiring hard coal from Pennsylvania and other states. John L. Lewis was in the saddle, and the railroad boys were whooping it up for more rail tonnage. The New Deal party graciously complied. Was it right, sensible or honest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have in my possession a list of large landowners in Texas who were paid $5,000 and more per year for not producing crops. , Many of them are big ranches, insurance I companies, and corporations that never did produce .crops. Others were paid more for allowing their land to remain idle than they could have made by working it. The tenants went to the cities and got on relief, the land grew up in Johnson grass and weeds; and thousands of rich bottom farms are now ruined for all time, a high price the landowner paid for New Deal relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the very time our cotton industry was at its lowest ebb, the largest cotton concern in the world (Anderson, Clayton company, of Houston) began erecting modern gins (electric), oil mills, compresses, and great cotton plantations in Mexico and South American countries, taking away America’s cotton business because we were paying a bonus for </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not </span><span class="font8">producing while foreign countries were paying a bounty </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">to</span><span class="font8"> produce. Another indictment that the New Deal Party paid a premium on laziness and put a penalty on thrift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I fear the confusion, turmoil and strife now prevalent is for a sinister purpose, and that it has been'deliberately planned by those who brought forth such bureaus as the NYA, the USES, and others equally vicious. There may be those who want things to get out of control so that martial law can be invoked. That will be the final step to a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Meantime, so the student of affairs is informed, “by July 1 [1944] the debt [of the United States] will equal the entire capital wealth of the nation, its factories, mines, farms, railroads, forests, etc. By the war’s end it will probably equal if not exceed the total wealth of the nation, including its homes, bed sheets, and wedding rings. It is obvious that existing wealth which is constantly wearing out cannot pay the debt. It will be paid only out of wealth created by future production, work and sweat.” So says S. B. Pettengill, author of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jefferson the Forgotten Man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Commpn Sense at the White House </span><span class="font10">♦ When the country was of small population the president had to expend considerable of his time and strength signing and countersigning documents which, it was incorrectly supposed, only the president should be able to sign. For instance, the president had to countersign the will of every Indian with whom the government dealt; he had to sign every order that permitted a government employee to stay in the service after retirement age; he had to make a personal examination of hundreds of orders adding to or withdrawing a few acres from the public domain; be had to . sign every act of Congress appropriating small sums for claims. Some of these burdens have now been taken from his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two White House clerks, 70 and 73 years of age, each of whom has been on duty at the White House more than 44 years, have just been asked by the president, in personal notes in his own handwriting, to stay on indefinitely in their present positions. An act of grace and kindness and common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Supposed to Color the News</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ In one of his press conferences President Roosevelt told the reporters that he knew that some reporters are required to color the news; if they do not they are liable to lose their jobs; that he personally knew of a lot of cases right in the room at the time where reporters had to write in accordance with orders. He thought this a tough situation, and intolerable to many people. And so it is. The president did not need to say that every reporter is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> supposed to mention the Roman Catholic Hierarchy only in terms of praise, no matter how much, in his heart, he despises the whole tyrannical outfit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Revived League of Nations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE Scriptures seem to clearly indicate that ‘the beast that was and is not and shall again be present’ is the League of Nations revived, as was so clearly presented by President Knorr of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in his broadcast from Cleveland, Ohio, September 20, 1942. One can but wonder how it will all come about, and whether, as is predicted by the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Observer,</span><span class="font10"> Franklin Delano Roosevelt will be its first president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To be sure, the suggestion that Mr. Roosevelt might be made the first president of the world was only a one-man suggestion, made by the Washington correspondent of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Observer,</span><span class="font10"> but it might be correct. He is just the type of man to aim for that kind of job, and it is a dead certainty that no man will get it who doesn’t desire it, or who doesn’t think he can handle it. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Observer</span><span class="font10"> man did not put it quite as bluntly as above stated. What he said was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Roosevelt will be, of course, the party’s choice if he wants a ■ fourth term but the president, it is said, may remove all speculation by taking up some office higher even than the American presidency in connection with world organization after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the fall of 1943, at the White House, 44 nations signed up for the United Nations' Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or the UNRRA as it is called for short. The nations for which 44 responsible officials signed their names were given as Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ei Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, not named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Freedom from Want”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At that conference the principal address was by President Roosevelt. He considered it a historic occasion of great importance. He stated the signers had “a common determination to build for the future a world of decency and security and, above all, peace”. He said, “We mean business in this war in a political and humanitarian sense, just as surely as we mean business in a military sense.” He drew attention to the fact that in a year from the time the Allies landed in French Africa that part of the world had been able to supply all its own needs, and that the next day, at Atlantic City, the UNRRA would begin its first formal conference and make the “first bold steps toward the practicable, workable realization of a thing called freedom from want”. Surely, never before in human history this side of the days of Joseph in Egypt has any one man had the assurance to announce that he has plans which he intends to carry out and which will free the whole world from want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Referring to the diabolical robberies perpetrated by the Nazis, the Fascists and the Japanese militarists on the peoples they have conquered, the president had previously said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ft is our determination to restore these conquered peoples to the dignity of human beings, masters of their own fate, entitled to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It may not be true, as charged by Representative Stephen A. Day (Republican, Illinois), in the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune, </span><span class="font10">that Mr. Roosevelt plans a one-nation world, but then again it may, and there are some things that give color to the idea. It may have been mere chance that</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">on Churchill’s 69th birthday (November 30, 1943) Mr. Roosevelt said to him, ‘‘May we be together for many years” (when he knew his own term as president would expire in 1944); and it may be also that Mr. Roosevelt had no big ideas of world domination in mind when he pre. sented his homestead at Hyde Park to ithe government, but it looks very much «as if he intended that home to become a ■ ‘ shrine. Why J</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No Hierarchy or Legion Methods Wanted</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Roosevelt knows very well that his dickerings with the pope and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, resulting, as they did, in the destruction of the Spanish Republic, are very objectionable to millions of the American people. They did not think well of his' appointing a personal representative of himself to be his own private ambassador to the Vatican. Why should he have such an ambassador, when other American presidents have been free from such entanglements? Nor did they think well of his sending Archbishop Spellman to Spain to gloat over the return of slavery and ignorance to the common people of that unhappy land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are millions of Americans who do not approve of their president’s con- eerning himself with the control of the American Legion, the plain history of which is that it is under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is not composed of the veterans that did the actual fighting, and has absolutely the worst record of contempt for American laws of any organization in the land. Munitions paid for by the American people have been turned over to the American Legion, and there was at one time a serious effort to make this organization a private army of the president; and the attempt almost succeeded. Premature publicity, and the courage and patriotism of one honest Maryland man, delayed the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The American people do not like to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font10"> have colossal projects sprung upon them without warning. They did not like it in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchukuo without warning; nor in 1935 when Italy invaded Ethiopia without warning; nor in 1938 when Germany invaded Austria without warning; nor in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland without warning; nor in 1940 when Germany invaded Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg without warning; nor in 1940 when Italy attacked France, Albania and Greece without warning; nor in 1941 when Germany invaded Yugoslavia, Hungary, Rumania, Greece and Russia without warning and Japan attacked the United States, Thailand, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies without warning. President Roosevelt did right when he drew public attention to these acts of injustice and unwisdom, and he should ponder the principle involved. In other words, he should cease trying to stampede Uncle Sam into making Congress a mere &quot;yes man” to every idea he gets in his head. Uncle Sam picked him out to serve, not to boss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Roosevelt did his plain duty when he officially notified Japan, on the basis of authentic information from China, that, having used poison gas -in sixty authenticated attacks on Chinese troops and cities, such attacks must cease, and if they do not cease the United States will retaliate in kind and in full'measure. It is to be hoped that gas warfare will not become general before the present war is ended; but who can prophesy what will be done before this war is ended? It is still true, as it was in the days of John the apostle, that &quot;the whole world lie th in wickedness” (1 John 5:19), and it is still true as it was in the days of the apostle Paul that humanity are in “the snare of the devil” and “are taken captive by him at his will”. (2 Timothy 2: 26) There is only one way out of the dilemma, and that is not in a new League of Nations (no matter what its new name, or who its president), but in the Kingdom for which Jesus taught His</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">followers to pray and which is of God and from heaven, and not of or from any earthly rulers, no matter how capable or how popular or powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the broadcast mentioned in paragraph one hereof, the speaker said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophecy shows that when the <sup>(f</sup>beast&quot; comes out of the abyss at the end of this total war it comes out with the woman “Babylon” on its back, or she climbs upon its back as soon as it gets out. That means that “organized religion”, and this time the religious organization with headquarters at Vatican City, will ride and exercise guiding influence over the League beast. . . . The pope’s five-point program calls for the Vatican’s free action without interference as one of the requirements of his “new order founded on moral principles”. Likewise the United Nations opposing the totalitarian powers voice their pledge of freedom of religion as one of the four freedoms to be secured when peace comes. The repeated cries and demands of politicians and religionists for <sup>f</sup>*More religion!” make certain that religion will ride the peace beast. The personal envoy sent by the president of the nation to the Vatican to work together with the religious chief for peace is another forerunner of the courtesy and deference that will be paid to the “woman” named Babylon when the total war ends.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Freedom of Religion”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">RESIDENT ROOSEVELT announces his belief in “freedom of religion”, by which he means every individual has a right to connect up with any one of the 256 sects doing business in the United States, or to go it alone, in the way that suits him best, even as an atheist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He says that “the German army has used the Holy City of Rome as a military center”. There is nothing said in the Scriptures about Rome as being a holy city. On the contrary, it is more than hinted at that it stands as a monument of unholiness, a monument of the Devil rather than a monument of the Lord. He has suggested that, after the war, Germany should furnish the labor and material to rebuild the Benedictine monastery-at Cassino. Is there anything particularly holy about the tunnel, far underground, that connected the monastery with the hotel at its foot? If anything is to be rebuilt by the Germans, let them restore the homes of the poor, who had all their possessions blown to the four winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The president voiced a great truth when he said, “There is no Joshua in our midst,” arid also when he said, “Perhaps not since the fathers of the Constitution established freedom of religion have our people had greater need for a return to the teachings of the Master.” The .president has surely had it drawn to his attention that Christian worship and religion are different; the first is true, is Scriptural; the second is tradition, and is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the launching of 14 cargo ships he is alleged to have said, “There shall be no death for America, for democracy, for freedom!” but he cited no scripture to support his hope. The word of the Lord is that, at a set time, and that time is just ahead, the God of heaven will break in pieces and consume all the ' governments of the world, and that by His Theocracy, which shall abide forever. (Daniel 2:44) The Theocracy is not a democracy; it is a kingdom. The King that Jehovah has selected is Christ Jesus, and when the president prays the Lord’s prayer, and prays that God’s will shall be done on earth as it is done in heaven, he prays for something that he knows in his heart is still future, and is not limited to the United States or to any past or future league of nations. He should speak a little more modestly about his knowledge of what is ahead for America and for democracy. As for freedom, God makes it plain that the spirit of the Lord is one of liberty to do right. That is true freedom, and is not obtainable in any great degree in any part of the world just now.</span></p><img src="g_E_19440830_files/g_E_19440830-3.png" alt="" style="width:412pt;height:531pt;">

<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Scenes in Persia, Sent by One of Uncle Sani's Boys</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">L</span><span class="font10">ESS than two hundred miles north of the mouth of the river Euphrates, and one of the principal stations on the railway that traverses the country from north to south, i^ the modern city of Susa, Persia. It was here that Nehemiah was sad in the presence of. Artaxerxes, here he quickly prayed to Jehovah that he might be able to answer wisely the demand to know why he was sad; and it was from here that he went out to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. (Nehemiah 1:1; 2:1-9) Jt was here that Esther took the place of Vashti, the queen of Ahasuerus (Esther 1:2,5; 2:8,17); here Haman paraded down the street leading Mordecai seated on the king’s horse, and here he was hanged by the neck until he was dead. (Esther 6:10,11; 7:10) Here, in the reign of King Belshazzar, Daniel had his vision of the cleansing of the sanctuary (Daniel 8:1,2) and had it explained to him by the angel Gabriel. Susa and Shushan, Shush and Sus are all names given to the ancient and modern city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia, </span><span class="font10">in an interesting four-page article on this important winter capital of Elam’s ancient kings, says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On this site there are extensive ruins, stretching, perhaps, twelve miles from one</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">extremity to the other, and consisting, like the other ruins of this region, of hillocks of earth and rubbish covered with broken pieces of brick and colored tile. At the foot of these mounds is the so-called Tomb of Daniel, a small building erected on the spot where the remains of that prophet are locally believed to rest. It is apparently modem; yet nothing but the belief that this was the site of the prophet’s sepulchre could have led to its being built in the place where it stands, and it may be added that such identifications are of more value in these parts, where occasion for them is rare, than among the crowded “holy places” of Palestine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of Uncle Sam’s boys, Private-V. M. Ottignon, sent us a letter from Shushan or Susa or Shush, which passed all the censors and came through in 17 days. He sent the pictures which you will see on the opposite page, and with them this letter:</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE pope was quick to congratulate</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler on his escape in the recent attack upon the Nazi fuehrer’s life. Pacelli was the first potentate to send such a message and knew it must get out that he did so. What to 'do. First the “semi-official” Vatican News Service acknowledged that it “understood” such a congratulatory message was sent. But it was only “formal”, which means, it would appear, that it meant nothing after all. Then “well-informed Vatican sources pointed out that such telegrams were </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font10">of the Holy See protocol”. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">other words, the pope couldn’t help himself; but still the congratulations did not mean anything, not a single thing. Also, the “spiritual state” (Vatican City) is neutral in political matters. This also is “understood”. A gentleman of integrity . reported that “nothing that issues from</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Hamburg and Berlin Preludes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font10">T WOULD be quite natural for’those who believe earthly rulers are “the higher powers” to explain in the following manner two of the passages in the Psalms t</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Upon the wicked he shall rain [from the * planes over Hamburg, Berlin, and other Nara cities] snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest. (Psalm 11: 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wicked [Hitler and his comrades in crime] shall see it, and he grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. (Psalm 112:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">JThe immediate objection to such an explanation would be that Stalin has done the Reich more harm on the ground than has thus far been done it from the air, and .nobody has yet advanced the explanation that he is Almighty God’s avenging angel. Thus clearing the air of misconceptions, an opportunity arises to consider these phenomena of the greatest of earth’s wars to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Obliteration of Hamburg</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From various sources comes the information that the preliminary attacks bn Hamburg were so intense that many people, on emerging from the shelters, no longer recognized their own district. A couple of months later (in June, 1943) conditions were so bad that' Belgian workers, engaged in attempted repair work, could not part with any clothing, even to have it washed, and expect to recover it*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By another month (July, 1943) 5,000 tons of bombs were being dropped in a single night; the glowing cauldron was visible for 200 miles; the smoke was risr ing three to five miles. By the end of the month 14,000 of the residents of the city had been killed; 400,000 of the city’s 1,500,000 residents had fled and every available vehicle had been pressed into service to carry them away. The next month, August, the Hamburg tunnel under the Elbe river was hit and the 18,000 citizens that had taken refuge in it were drowned like rats in a trap. It was two months before the full story reached the outside world. This is the tale as finally told:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost no one escaped in the heavily populated area of many square kilometers on which the Allied planes planted a “carpet” of hundreds of thousands of explosive and incendiary bombs. A phenomenon resulted in which the fire drew the oxygen from the surrounding air, forming a constantly increasing “air chimney” in which the flames mounted higher and higher, increasing in violence and finally forming a compact roof of fire. The movement of air was comparable to a typhoon, a gigantic force pumping air from all directions, and the streets serving as conduits, with flames ' rushing through them to meet the offered oxygen. A life and death struggle ensued between the flames and the people, the latter inevitably losing. The fire consumed the last bit of oxygen in cellars and finally exhausted that in air raid shelters, which at the same time were subjected to unbearable heat. At the, start of the bombing, when there was still time, the people did not dare leave the shelters to face the hail of flaming bombs. Only a minute percentage of the population 'that dared flee when the attack started, escaped. A few minutes later the attacked area was encircled by fire from which not even the widest streets and public squares could afford refuge. Those who remained in the shelters, where at least 20,000 persons perished, were reduced to ashes. The authorities were quoted as saying that the heat surpassed that of incinerators. One doctor observed that the combustion of bones was more complete than in normal crematories. There were no traces for identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Information reaching Sweden was that only two buildings were left standing in Hamburg and 50,000 perished in a single night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Berlin Turned to a Madhouse</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler had intended to make Berlin the capital of the world. Plans had been made for avenues and buildings to rival those of earth’s most beautiful city, Washington, D.C., and some work had been done in the way of constructing them. But no city today is safe from attacks by air. The Allies had decided to do to Berlin what they did to Hamburg, and what German airmen had previously done to Coventry and London, Section by section the city was marked for destruction and night by night and day by day tons of bombs turned the streets into an inferno. In many places the asphalt on the pavements boiled and people in near-by areas collapsed from the intense heat. Fire‘brigades were called from Stettin, Leipzig and other cities to fight walls of flame a half mile long. The Nazi radio itself proclaimed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Berlin has been covered with a carpet of bombs and has suffered the greatest destruction ever wreaked upon a city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Twenty percent of the 5,000,000 residents of the city were conscripted to fight the fires, and to aid in rescues and salvage work. Gas, electricity and water were cut off from some parts of the city, and passengers for other cities had to walk five miles to railroad stations outside the bombed area. On some of the worst days Berlin was cut off by telephone and telegraph from the rest of the world. On a single night there were more than a thousand fires; Hitler’s balcony went like Mussolini’s. The zoo was smashed and elephants and other animals roamed the streets. The acrid smoke of the burning city was noted in Sweden, 300 miles distant. Entire blocks of ten to a dozen squares became masses of fire which were entirely out of control. Subways and elevateds could not function in many parts of the city. On one occasion 350 two-ton bombs were dropped in the course of half an hour. The bombing crews could see the lights of the fires 100 miles away, and two hours after the bombings whole streets were outlined in dull red through the thin clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">- Even Hitler Squawked</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the big bombings were shifted from Hamburg to Berlin, even Hitler squawked. Shoved into his present job by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Germany’s Big Business crowd, he must have suspected all was not well when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Providence is making no gift to our nation in the struggle for freedom and the future. Everything must be fought for by the toughness of German soldiers at the front as well as by the homeland in a most severe test of endurance. Even the last German soldier must be imbued with the conviction that this cruel struggle, which the enemy desired, which he imposed on us and for which he bears the responsibility, cannot be ended except in victory. The nation that loses will have ended its existence because it is madness to expect anything else of this battle but victory or perdition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From photographs which they took the RAF calculated that of 8,000 acres of buildings which they bombed 1,360 acres, or 17 percent, had passed out; but where the government offices were located 60 percent were destroyed. The German government thereupon moved its headquarters to Breslau, 150 miles to the southeast. The city (Berlin) has kept going, after a fashion, but it took five hours to find a store, open, that could supply an ordinary writing pad for making business notes. Every store may shut two days a week. Everybody in the city looks worn out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Goering, one of the German “big shots”, is described as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He stands outside his villa in the Berlin suburbs, gazing vacantly at the sky, utterly bewildered by the strength of the Allied aerial blows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News from Belgium</span><span class="font10"> reports a Belgian businessman who said he attended a Berlin movie. Hitler was shown on the screen; there was a derisive whistling, whereupon the newsreel was interrupted, and the manager called for the Gestapo, who fired shots at random into the auditorium. Three of these shots hit the Belgian in the arm; he went to a physician to have his arm dressed and the doctor advised him to get out of Berlin as quickly as possible, as the situation vyas getting out of hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bombings All over the Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The bombings have been persistent all lover Germany. Among the places named as having been ruined are Augsburg, Cologne, Aachen, Essen, Hanover, Leipzig, Frankfurt, Kiel, Dresden, Wilhelmshaven, Dusseldorf, Renscheid, Cre-feld, and Barmen-Elberfeld. A traveler through Augsburg two days after it was bombed said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We stayed at the station for a half hour at 11:30 at night. Here’s what we saw: the whole city, population 200,000, in complete flames. Not a person to be seen in the town. At the station thousands and thousands of Germans, men, women and children, their possessions under their arms, in complete panic. They tried to get into our coaches, climbing through the windows. They had to be pushed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> said that the damage at Frankfurt is such that nothing is left of the government and business section of the city. (In the same issue it also took pains to say that in the retreat of the Germans from Russia they did not forget to steal all the factory equipment they could manage to carry away with them.) Thousands of families of Essen, described as the “most bombed city in the world” because it is near the Krupp plant, fled the city but were warned that in so doing they forfeited all rights to return at any time to claim their properties. Swedish engineers returning from Germany to their own land estimated that 8,000,000 Germans arc homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With 10 percent of the people homeless, so many of the women are without addresses in some of the principal centers that 40 percent of them, called up for war industry, failed to present themselves. Women can endure only about so much. At Munich, when pictures of the Russian front were shown, the police were called to suppress a riot started by sobbing women. At Berlin the police were helpless when, on a train returning from the front, weeping, screaming women discovered paper bandages on severely wounded men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German labor front announces that in the five years of the war 650,000 homes have been built, or offices turned into homes or otherwise made available for human occupancy. The bungalows are two-room affairs; there is no plumbing. Meantime, as a result of the bombings, many go insane, children are struck dumb, and thousands of bodies of bomb victims are buried in mass graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “super-race” bunk is being gradually exploded, as may be judged from the two paragraphs which follow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">[a] A person whose nervous system is defective cannot stand heavy aerial bombardments. Thus, aerial bombardments will help us to discover the neurasthenics and remove them from social life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">[b] We mourn not only the death of our fellow citizens, but those shocks which all residents of Essen have to suffer. Bombardments inevitably affect the nervous system, and how many sensitive natures have been crippled for ever by the barbarous raids ? How many talented adolescents, how many frail German women have been affected with nervous ailments, frequently incurable?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">The first of these was published in a Nazi periodical in 1938, and the second was published in Goering’s own newspaper, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">National Zeitung,</span><span class="font10"> July 18, 1943, and shows that Goering, at least, has begun to see a few things from “gazing vacantly into the sky”. He doesn’t see Armageddon; not yet. That’s future. But he sees what might be called the prelude to it, like the little click of an alarm clock shortly before the alarm itself wakens the sleeper.</span></p><img src="g_E_19440830_files/g_E_19440830-4.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:75pt;">
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Identifying the Messiah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">i</span><span class="font10">S THE one who on earth nineteen centuries ago bore the name “Jesus” the Messiah ? It is, of course, important to be able to answer this question from the inspired Scriptures where the Messiah is described, and to have the decision on the matter so clearly fixed that there cannot be any doubt as to the correctness of the answer. It is necessary to examine the many prophecies concerning this important personage, and then to determine from historical facts upon whom such identifying prophecies have been fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An early prophecy relating to the Messiah is at Genesis 49:10: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” The here-mentioned “Shiloh” is the Messiah. Unto Him shall the gathering of the people be. It therefore conclusively follows that he who is the Messiah must be the great Deliverer of obedient humankind. The prophet Moses, whom Jehovah God used in the deliverance of the nation of Israel from Egypt, was a type of the Messianic Deliverer; for Moses said by inspiration of God: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15,18) The Messiah must be a prophet greater than Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The identification of the Messiah has long been in doubt in the minds of millions of honest persons, both Jews and Gentiles. Those who are Jews at heart believe what Moses and the other prophets of God testified. Concerning those who are merely Jews according to the. fleshly descent from Abraham Paul, a one-time zealous practitioner of “the Jews’ religion”, has written, saying: “Their minds were blinded.” (Second Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 3, verse fourteen) The genuine identification of the Messiah would necessarily bring gladness to the hearts of those who believe the honest facts. It would be good news to such, that is, gospel, for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gospel</span><span class="font10"> means “good news”. Now writes this same exreligionist concerning the good news of the Messiah: “But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ [or Messiah], who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan the enemy, “the god of this world,” has caused the blindness which came upon the Jews and which has likewise come over the major portion of the Gentiles. Divers means he has used to accomplish this; anything to blind them to God’s purpose and to keep their minds turned away from God and His means of deliverance of. humankind. For our enlightenment let us examine the prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Messiah” means “Anointed <sub>(</sub>0ne”; “Christ” means the same thing. “Anointed” means the one who is clothed with authority to act in behalf of the one who does the anointing. Jehovah God, who caused the prophecies concerning the Messiah or Anointed One, is He that does the anointing. The Messiah, therefore, is clothed with authority from Him to act as the great executive officer of Jehovah God. We should expect to find sufficient in the prophecies that will enable us to determine who is the Messiah and that would agree with other evidence relating to this vital matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this case prophecy is the foretelling long in advance, by hundreds of years in fact, the events that will take place in the future. No man can truly foretell future events. But God, who knows the end from the beginning as respects His specific purposes, can foretell future events. In times past He used various human agencies as instruments to utter and make record of His prophecies. The invisible energy of Jehovah God, namely, His holy spirit, working through the minds of holy men of old, caused them to make record of events that would come to pass in the future. Those men did not understand what they then prophesied. It was the, prophecy of Almighty God; and these men or prophets merely wrote down the things prophesied under the direction of the holy spirit.—2 Peter 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The'Jewish writer Peter, an apostle of the Messiah, testifies that the holy prophets did not understand the things concerning which they prophesied. (1 Peter 1:11, 12) Why did they not understand? Because it was not yet God’s due time for these things to be understood by men, and because the holy spirit or active force of God had not yet been given to men to serve to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now is the due time in which those prophecies may be better understood; and those who have devoted themselves wholly to the Lord and who seek to understand He permits to understand the deep things of God as set down in His Word. (1 Corinthians 2: 9,10) Anyone of devoted mind who reads the sacred prophecies prayerfully and sees facts to correspond with them may understand the prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But how may we know when we have the proper understanding of a prophecy? Thus: If we find God foretold that certain things would come to pass, and thereafter we see actually taking place the very things that He foretold, then we may be sure that such is in fulfillment of divine prophecy and is not private interpretation. An instance of this is the prophecy at Daniel, chapter twelve, verse four, reading: “But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” And indeed, in this time of disturbance since 1914, Jehovah’s consecrated people have been and are running to and fro in diligent search through the pages of the Holy Scriptures and by reason of the illumination which the Author thereof sheds upon those pages the knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures has been increased to His faithful people and they are engaged in an educational campaign among all nations to aid others to come to this same knowledge. Persecution has not stopped this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prophecy can be understood only after its fulfillment, or while in the course of fulfillment. When it is fulfilled, then we properly speak of the fulfillment as the “physical facts”; that is to say, the facts which stand out as silent witnesses testifying to the taking place of certain events, which events had been foretold. With this rule in mind, let us here make a beginning of noting some of the prophecies recorded in the Bible concerning the Messiah, and then see if the despised “Jesus of Nazareth” fulfilled those prophecies. Only if the testimony of the facts proves beyond a doubt that He did fulfill them would this be conclusive proof to identify Him as the great Messiah of whom Moses was a type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let us begin with the prophecy of Isaiah by which God foretold this: “Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: behold, this young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and she shall call his name ’Immanuel, (God with us).” (Isaiah 7:14, Leeser’s translation) The original Hebrew word here translated “young woman” is translated at Psalm 68:26 “maidens”, and at Canticles 1: 3 “maidens”, and at Exodus 2: 8 “maiden”. Its occurrences also at Genesis 24: 43 and Proverbs 30:19 and Canticles 6:8 combine with the foregoing occurrences to show that “young woman” means specifically a “virgin”. At Matthew 1:18-25 the Jewish writer, when quoting the prophecy, uses the Greek word specifically meaning “virgin” and tells how Mary, the earthly mother of Jesus, conceived by the power of God’s holy spirit and in due time gave birth to the child Jesus, in clear fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14. The Greek Septuagint Version of the Hebrew Scriptures, which version was made by Greek-speaking Jews, also uses the same word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">parthenos</span><span class="font10"> (nagflews) at Isaiah 7:14 as Matthew 1:23 uses.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>A Few Fish Facts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font10">OME of the biggest fish ever caught with hook and line were a 1,919-pound man-eater shark off Kangaroo island, South Australia; a 976-pound Pacific black marlin at the Bay of Islands, New Zealand; a 927-pound tuna fish in Ipswich bay, Massachusetts; an 860-pound swordfish at Tocopilla, Chile; a 736-pound sawfish at Galveston, Texas; a 692-pounc( striped marlin at Balboa, California; a 542-pound jewfish at Sarasota, Florida; a 515-pound California black sea bass at Santa Catalina, California; a 247-pound tarpon at Panuco, Mexico; a 190-pound sailfish at Post Office bay, Galapagos islands; a 133-pound wahoo in British West Indies; a 103-pound great barracuda in the Bahama islands; a 106-pound amber jack at Passagrille, Florida. The shark was 14 feet 8 inches long, and the barracuda, 5 feet 6 inches long, with the others in proportion in between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1940 California produced .1,290,-446,000 pounds of fish; Alaska, 563,688,-000; Massachusetts, 510,938,000; Virginia, 269,651,000; Florida, 187,492,000; North Carolina, 170,581,000; New Jersey, 160,554,000; Washington, 111,632,000; Louisiana, 145,840,000; Delaware, 103,-017,000. In March, 1944, a single dragnet off Norfolk, Virginia, brought in 150 barrels (30,000 pounds) of fish in' one hour and forty minutes. And right away they went back to try for another haul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The city of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, had a big fish haul a few months previous to the above; thousands of shad, bass, perch and eel were beached, where they had come to get away from blasting on the opposite shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sounds are very audible to those beneath the surface. When you were a boy, and dived off into deep water, did one of the other boys crack two stones together under the water? If he did, you know how it made your ears ring. Fish make very little noise, but it hag now been discovered that they do have a variety of honks, beeps, grunts, drums, teeth-grindings, and another sound resembling a cat purring. The toadfish is the most noisy of all the fish family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Effects of Certain Chemicals</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A w’ay has been found to make the tiger shark quite harmless. He sometimes attacks 'men in the water, but he doesn’t any more if they have on their persons a certain repellent that offends his sense of smell. It took quite a while to discover it. The reason he doesn’t like it is that it smells like dead shark meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another odd thing is that warmblooded animals can eat derris root and it does not affect them, but when fish eat it they die. The Indians of countries on the Caribbean discovered this long ago, and so when they go fishing they just throw some of the dried roots into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">pools and carry home the fish that pass insects, and it is now being made for out. The extract of derris root kills that purpose, under the name Rotenone.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>What Is Ordination?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">[Reprinted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Selective Service in Wartime,</span><span class="font7"> Second Report of the Director of Selective Service, 1941-42, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">TXT </span><span class="font10">HAT is ordination? In some of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">4 VV </span><span class="font10">churches this is a sacrament attended by very elaborate ceremonies which follow prolonged periods of philosophical and theological training and acceptance by a bishop; in other cases it is the simplest of ceremonies or acts without any preliminary serious or prolonged theological training. The determinations of this status by the Selective Service System have been generous in the extreme. The question of fact of whether a person was a minister was difficult at times in such groups as the Jehovah’s witnesses, hut we need not here enter in any detail into that discussion. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to who constitute regular ministers of religion, a very broad definition of this vocation was formulated for those charged with Presidential appeals as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ordinary concept of “preaching and teaching” is that it must be oral and from the pulpit or platform. Such is not the test. Preaching and teaching have neither locational nor vocal limitations. The method of transmission of knowledge does not determine its value or effect its purpose or goal. One may preach or teach from the pulpit, from the curbstone, in the fields, or at the residential fronts. ITe may shout his message “from housetops” or write it “upon tablets of stone”. He may give his “sermon on the mount”, heal the eyes of the blind, write upon the sands while a Magdalene kneels, wash disciples’ feet or die upon the cross. He may carry his message with the gentleness of a Father Damien to the bedside of the leper, or hurl inkwells at the devil with all the crusading vigor of a Luther. -But if in saying the word or doing the thing which gives expression to the principle of religion, he conveys to those who “have cars to hear” and “eyes to see”, the concept of those principles, he both preaches and teaches. lie may walk the streets in daily converse with those about him telling them of those ideals that arc the foundation of his religious conviction, or he may transmit his 'message on the written or printed page, but he is none the less the minister of religion if such method has been adopted by him as the effective means of inculcating in the minds and hearts of men the principles of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But to be a “regular minister” of religion ho must have dedicated himself to his task to the extent that his time and energies are devoted to it to the substantial exclusion of other activities and interests. He cannot “serve God and mammon” and lay claim to a status as a “regular minister”. To be a “regular minister” of religion the translation of religious principles into the lives of his fellows must be the dominating factor in his own life, and must have that continuity of purpose and action that renders other purposes and actions relatively unimportant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The principle was extended to persons who were not, in any strict sense, ministers or priests in any sacerdotal sense. It included Christian Brothers, who are religious, who live in communities g.part from the world and devote themselves exclusively to religious teaching; Lutheran lay teachers, who also dedicate themselves to teaching, including religion; to the Jehovah’s witnesses, who sell their religious books, and thus extend the Word. It includes lay brothers in Catholic religious orders, and many other groups who dedicate their lives to the spread of their religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">2. HOLY ROMAN CHATHOLIC CHURCH — </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Uy Brothers</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">It appears that Catholic Brothers have made profession of the vows required of them by their respective religious Congregations, auch as poverty, chastity, obedience, and are said to devote all of their time to their Congregations, Moreover, when the Selective Training and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Act was </span><span class="font7">being discussed in Congress, it was made clear that it was intended' that the Brothers were included in the purview of the statutory exemption from training and service of regular ministers of religion. It is believed that they are and should be considered &quot;regular ministers of religion,&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been officially certified to National Headquarters by an official of the Church thati</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I beg to certify that according to the laws of the Church, the term ’Brother’ or 'Lay Brother* signifies a regular minister of religion, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>n</sup>’Lay Brothers* in all the canonically approved societies, orders end congregations are religious ministers in the fullest aanas of that term as defined in the Code of Canon Law (Canon 488,70).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are deliberately received into an ecclesiastically approved religious order by the profession of the vows'of solemn promises of religion; they, as real ministers of religion, may cooperate . in the sacred ministry of the priests and the salvation of souls, by the performance of the special tasks assigned to them in schools, hospitals, religious institutes, houses of study or elsewhere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The ’Lay Brothers,’ so-called, are not only bound to the obligations of the clerical state (Cfr, Canons 592 and 679) but they also enjoy the very same privileges as clerics (Cfr. 614 and 680).<sup>n</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Whether an official of the Johovah’s Witnossas group stands in the same relationship to this group as a regular or duly ordained minister in other religions must be determined in each individual case based upon whether he devotes his life in the furtherance of the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, whether he performs functions which are normally performed by regular or duly ordained ministers of other religions, and finally, whether he is regarded by other Jehovah's Witnesses in the same manner in which regular or duly ordained ministers of other religions are </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ordinarily regarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experience has shown that due to the fact that a large proportion of the members of any Jehovah’s Witnesses unit ulaim to bo ministers, special care must be used in applying the above-mentioned tests. Information presented in the case of a registrant who claims to be a minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses-group must show facts regarding both his ministerial position and his ministerial activities which clearly justify his exemption as a minister. Certificates, affidavits, or statements of opinion are not necessarily conclusive proof of a ministerial status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Members of the Bethel Family are those members of Jehovah's Witnesses who devote their full time and effort to the manufacture and production of books, pamphlets, and supplies for the religious benefit of Jehovah's Witnesses, the purpose of which is to present the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and to convert others. For their religious services, the members of this group are said to receive their subsistence and lodging and in addition a very roods st monthly allowance. This group of individuals consists of the office and factory workers at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, and workers in the executive offices at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">How York, </span><span class="font7">and at the Farms,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pioneers of Jehovah's Witnesses are those members of Jehovah's Witnesses who devote all or substantially all of their time to the dissemination of the tenets and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">certified official list of members of the Bothel Family and Pioneers has boen transmitted to the State Directors of Selective Service by National Headquarters as an attachment to State Director Advice No. 213-C. The members of the Bethel Family and Pioneers whose names appear upon such certified official list were thought at the time the list was issued to come within the purview of section 5 (d) of the Selective Training and Service Act of. 1940, as amended, and if they have continued in the same status, they should be classified in Class IV-D. The status of members of the Bothel Family and Pioneers whose names do not appear upon such certified official list shall be determined as herein provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other members of Jehovah's Witnesses, known by the various names of servant to the brethren, company servant, assistant company servant, backcall servant, territory servant, advertising servant, account servant, stock servant, and other servants, devote their time and effort in varying degrees to the dissemination of the tenets and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. Often the servants to the brethren and the company servants are found to be devoting their lives to a work of ministry to the substantial exclusion of secular employment. In such cases, they may be considered for classification into Class IV-D as ministers of religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Composing Sentences</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">K</span><span class="font10">NOWING words is one thing; skillful use of them in constructing sentences is another. One’s task is not finished with the acquiring of a large vocabulary. That is just the beginning. Few words by themselves express a complete thought. They are the materials from which complete thoughts are expressed. Words may be likened to the building material brought to a site for the purpose of building a house, but as yet not put into any framework for the form of the building. If the material is left on the ground without being constructed into some form the finished building will never be realized. And even if there are willing hands to do the assembling and fastening-together work, these hands must also be skillful ones. Additionally, there is a blueprint or a plan directing how this material shall be. placed together and fastened in solid form, making a house. Not all houses follow the same plan. They do not all look alike. But in certain fundamental respects they agree. All must have a good foundation, a sturdy, well-braced frame, a roof, etc. Different types of houses, from the simple cottage to the fine mansion, require different materials ; yet they all conform to certain basic rules in order to stand intact and fulfill their purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same is true in the constructing of sentences: choice and taste may call ' for the composing of a wide variety of sentences, sentences that at first glance seem to have nothing in common with one another; yet, like the cottage and the mansion, all proper sentences conform to certain rigid rules of grammar. Words are the component parts of a sentence. They must be tied together according to the grammatical ‘&quot;blueprint” if they are to be properly united to form a complete thought expression. But not all should follow the same plan. Just as a row of houses might conform to the basic rules of construction and yet offend the senses by looking like a string of cracker boxes, so sentences might be grammatically flawless and yet be distasteful and monotonous if they are all childishly simple and alike. Even mansions similar to one another in every detail would lose any beauty they might have originally had. A knowledge of composition and rhetoric, coupled with grammar, will enable one to frame variously constructed sentences of greatest effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no shortage nor rationing of sentence-building materials. There is a plenty of words. The only cost of securing them is effort spent in going to the dictionary or other word books that are available. The material is not the problem, but the skillful putting-together of it to convey in pleasing phrase the thought one wishes to present is the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When one expresses a complete thought he has made a sentence, because a sentence is the expression of a complete thought. It is composed of a group of words, and is, therefore, a composition. Generally, a sentence contains a subject and a predicate. It should end with a period or an interrogation mark or an exclamation mark. Brief mention may be made here of the reasons for different punctuation marks’ being used at the end of sentences. When a sentence is either declarative or imperative it ends with a period; when it ends with an exclamation mark (!) it is an exclamatory sentence; and when it ends with an interrogation or question mark (?) it is interrogative in meaning. Declarative sentences make assertions. The imperative is used in entreating, commanding, and in giving directions. The exclamatory is employed to express strong emotion, and the interrogative asks a question. Sentences extend from one full pause to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sentences (except in the case of sentence-words, such as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Help! Halt! Amen,</span><span class="font10"> which, due to their context or the circumstances under which they are uttered, express a complete thought in ■ themselves) are divided in two parts, subject and predicate. The subject is the person or thing spoken about; the t &nbsp;&nbsp;predicate is that which is stated con* &nbsp;&nbsp;cerning the subject. From the stand</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. point of grammatical classification sentences are spoken of as being simple, complex, compound, and compoundcomplex. Rhetorically speaking, sentences are divided into classes such as periodic, loose, balanced (using either parallelism or antithesis), and short or ong. In two subsequent articles these classifications will be discussed, with the exception of the loose and periodic sentences, which are defined in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What is rhetoric? and can it aid to better speech? Rhetoric is the science that tells how words should be used and combined in order to make speech clear and effective. Rhetoric may be distinguished from grammar in that grammar is the law and rule by which a sentence may be determined as being correct or incorrect, whereas rhetoric determines its state as it pertains to choice and taste. This has to do not only with the choice of words but also with the phrasing and combining of phrases and the type of sentences used for a desired effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This may be demonstrated by the use of the loose sentence, which is employed when an informal, conversational style is desired. This kind of sentence is so constructed that it may be brought to a grammatical end before the actual conclusion is reached and still make sense and be complete. When used with other sentence types the loose sentence gives variety to composition. There is danger, however, that this type of sentence may become careless and slovenly in construction, if clauses and phrases are not</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">well placed, because the main thought is placed first and qualifications of detail are secondary, and it may allow for careless modifiers. But if used in conversational and narrative construction loose sentences will give one the advantage of , simplicity of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Contrasted with the loose sentence is the periodic sentence. While the loose sentence can be terminated before its end, the periodic sentence cannot end until the last word is reached. In this way the qualifications must be firm, as they precede the main statement, which is reserved unto the last. By this means one’s attention is roused and held in suspense till the main idea is stated. This makes the periodic sentence more formal and emphatic. It would not be so fitting if the thoughts expressed were of a commonplace nature, but rather should be reserved for the expressing of points calling for more power and force than ordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The aim of good construction in sentences is for clearness, emphasis, unity, strength, and harmony. In order to insure clearness and emphasis attention must be given to modifiers; that is, modifiers of words, phrases and clauses should be put next to those words that they modify. To modify means to limit or restrict the meaning of, or to qualify. If one were to say that he dislikes grapes, that would be a general statement and would mean that he does not like any kind of grapes; but if one were to say that he dislikes sour grapes, then the meaning would be different and would be limited or qualified by telling what kind of grapes he dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One might say, “We only saw two publishers.” Does the speaker mean that those referred to by the personal pronoun “we” were the only ones who saw the two publishers? If so, his placement of the modifier “only” is correct. However, if he means to state that .only two publishers were visible, then the modifier should be so placed that ambiguity is avoided. He should say, “We saw only two publishers.” Even greater care must be exercised in this respect when phrases or clauses are used to modify, and especially in loose sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been said that words are plentiful. That does not mean, that one should be lavish in his use of them. A speech or composition gains virility and strength by cutting out all words that do not add to the meaning. Words that contribute nothing hut wordage are </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">lik</span><span class="font10">e barnacles on the sides of a ship: they slow the progress of exposition or argument. As wise King Solomon said, “Let thy words be few”; that is, as few as possible to express the thoughts one has for presentation. (Ecclesiastes 5: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2) </span><span class="font10">For the most part, composition of sentences should follow simple lines. God’s Word, the Bible, does. It is the outstanding example for Theocratic ministers to follow, even in the field of sentence construction.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Pamphilus—One-Man Bible Society</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font10">AMPHILUS was a native of Phoe-necia, the son of a noble family of Beirut. He was educated in the Christian ministry by Prierius of Alexandria, which was then a sort of center of Christian education and learning. Pamphilus had previously sold all his goods and given the proceeds to the poor in literal compliance with Jesus’ words to the rich young ruler. (Matthew 19:16-26) This course was followed by quite a number of rich men, young and old, and doubtless contributed much to the rapid spread of at least professed Christianity in the first centuries of its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not much remains of the accounts of the life of Pamphilus, but the information that does remain testifies to his genuine devotion to the Lord and the truth. He settled after a time in Cae-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sarea, where he became a servant or minister of the local company of Christians. In this position he devoted himself to the collecting of a library, which has become famous in history. He also established a school which might be called an “education center for Theocratic ministry&quot;. He delighted in assisting scholars who desired to prepare themselves for such ministry. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> speaking of this stage in his life, says, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He devoted himself chiefly to producing accurate copies of the Holy Scriptures. Testimonies. to his zeal and care in this work are to be found in the colophons of Biblical MSS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These colophons were footnotes stating who had done the copying,'the com-' paring and the correcting of the copied manuscripts, and from what authentic source the material was copied. At the end of the book of Esdras (Ezra) in the still existent Sinaiticus codex the following note appears:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was compared with a very ancient copy that had been corrected by the hand of the blessed martyr Pamphilus to which is appended in his own hand this subscription: “It was transcribed and corrected according to the Hexapla of Origen. Antonius compared. I, Pamphilus, corrected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It appears that Pamphilus, besides being a careful copyist, was also a conscientious and exacting'proofreader of texts copied by his assistants, of whom there were doubtless not a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Out of these laboriously produced Bible supplies, Pamphilus took pleasure in distributing copies to the poorer scholars, not merely lending them, but giving them, a gift of no mean value in those days when a copied book was something that only the “better classes’ could possess. He also gave copies to women who were devoted to study, observing in so doing the Scriptural statement that there is no distinction, when it comes to the Lord’s favor, between men and women. Pamphilus also produced copies of Origen’s works and came to his defense in an apology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then, as well as since, there were some young and rather foolhardy enthusiasts among the disciples who provoked trouble rather than seeking to avoid it with Theocratic tactfulness. When the Diocletian persecution was in progress a young man who studied under Pamphilus and apparently lived in the - same house (probably a number of men lived in some co-operative arrangement) took occasion to interrupt the governor when he was offering sacrifice to the heathen gods. Strictly speaking, it was none of the young man’s business, .nor does it appear to have been the time and place to give a “witness” to the truth. But he did it, and it is not for us to judge him harshly. The results can be imagined. The young fellow paid for his boldness, with a terrible martyrdom. Not long after, Pamphilus was brought before the governor himself, and, refusing to sacrifice to the heathen gods, was tortured and cast into prison. There he continued copying and correcting manuscripts until beheaded, in February, A.D. 309.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>It Pays to Be Decent</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font10">EHOVAH’S witnesses have suffered much in Texas. Mobs have attacked them with consent or connivance of the authorities in scores of places, of which del Rio, San Antonio, and shameless Odessa are samples. Apparently decent Mexicans have suffered in Texas as a result of these and other acts of misgovernment. In some way the Texas governor got word that Mexican workers, now much needed in the southwest, would avoid Texas, and so he wrote to Hon. Ezequiel Padilla, secretary for foreign affairs of Mexico:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Arty decision of Your Excellency’s government to prohibit the moving of Mexican laborers under these Agreements into the state of Texas would cause me deep distress, because the government in my charge is now making a sincere effort to wipe out discrimination in cases where it has arisen and to make Mexicans resident in Texas feel that they are selfrespecting and loyal members of the communities in which they reside. Moreover, I am today issuing instructions to all law-enforcing agencies of the government of the state of Texas to be especially vigilant in order to prevent discriminations against Mexicans and where incidents arise to be especially severe under the laws of this state in order that those who may commit infractions will not again violate our good neighbor policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. This was wholesome, even if selfish, repentance. Mr. Padilla expressed his appreciation of it, but in order to let the governor of Texas wax still more enthusiastic in the business of giving Texas a real government, of which the people of Texas and other states need not feel ashamed, he said in his reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many places in your state where Mexican residents can not attend shows or places of decent amusement without exposing themselves to annoyance, criticism and protest. There are towns where my countrymen are forced to dwell in certain sections. Not even the families of our official representatives are safe from such persecution, or from unwarrantable molestation. Hardly a week ago, in the heart of an important city of the state of Texas, in a public establishment, they refused to serve the daughter of our consul, just because they heard her speaking Spanish to another Mexican young lady she was with. Incidents like this occur daily, and if the newspapers gave special prominence to the one I mention, it was not so much because of its rarity as on account of the position of the person involved. While consuls report to the authorities, newspapers and dwellers on the Texas border gather and transmit information directly reaching the whole people of the Republic of Mexico. Such reports have aroused a feeling of righteous indignation because of the discrimination shown against our nationals, based not only on racial differences, but in many cases on the mere fact of their Mexican nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Maybe, in 1944, Jehovah God is putting it into the hearts of some to-rebuke and shame those that in 1940, went out of their way to shamelessly abuse and attack Jehovah’s witnesses for proclaiming The Theocracy as the one and only hope of a perfect government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">At the Australian Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ At the Townsville Assembly a con-ventioner equipped with a magazine bag was returning home by bus. An American soldier placed his hand on her shoulder, and asked whether she was a “Bibl^ Student”. “That’s fine,” he said. “The best friends I have back home are ‘Bible Students’.” A good quantity of literature was placed with this truth-hungry boy from the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the Brisbane Assembly, while street-witnessing a publisher was approached by an American soldier: “Well, isn’t it fine to see Jehovah’s witnesses again!” He related that his family back home were witnesses, and that he was looking forward to the time when he could return and join them in the witness work. He had attended the St. Louis convention in 1941, and had been present in the vast auditorium when the 15,000 youngsters had received their free copy of the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font10"> He emptied the astounded publisher’s bag there and then!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also at Brisbane, after a hard day’s work, one of the convention staff was returning home late at night. As she left her tram, a policeman walked past her, stopped, came back, and said, “I’ll walk with you and protect you.” As they walked and talked, the sister introduced herself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Extending his hand, the policeman said, “Put it there.” He said further ' that he had read and enjoyed some of the books, and gladly accepted an invitation to attend the convention.—Australian </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>

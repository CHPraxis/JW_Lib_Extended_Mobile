<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">1 </span><span class="font4">EHOVAH'S day is Freedom’s day! It begins with </span><span class="font5">I </span><span class="font4">the birth of the free Nation. Mighty blows for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> freedom throughout the universe follow, struck by that Nation. The field of action is heaven and earth. Heaven first feels the joy of the clearing out of the enemy. No mere blasting of squadrons of airplanes out of the skies is that, to guarantee the freedom of the air. No; it is the downing of man's great oppressor from his heavenly seat of power to the confined quarters of the earth, there to face execution within a “short time&quot;. The jubilant cry loudly rings throughout the heavens: “Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Anointed One, because that accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast out.”—Rev. 12:1-10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font4"> translation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The free Nation, clothed with power and authority and bringing salvation to men, is the kingdom of God's Anointed One, God’s most highly exalted Son, who now enters in actively upon his authority. The Nation's Father is Jehovah God, who bestows the kingdom upon his Son. Its mother is Jehovah's universal organization of faithful, holy creatures and is called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Zion.</span><span class="font4"> The birth of the Nation of the Anointed One came at God's appointed time, in A.D. 1914, before the travail of the “war in heaven&quot; began. Concerning that event without equal God's prophet said long ago: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Before</span><span class="font4"> she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.”—Isa. GG: 7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Zion’s other “children”, besides the “man child” or Anointed King of the new Nation, must be brought forth as citizens of the Nation. As it was foretold in the Psalms: “And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the Highest himself</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 What events In heaven at the beginning of Jehovah’s day mark It as Freedom’s day’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2 What is the “free nanon”, what is Its parentage, and when was it born<sup>9</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3 As what, therefore, are her other ‘'children” brought forth, and what is the new nation called, and by what was it foreshadowed?</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">shall establish her. The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.” (Ps. 87:5,6) The new Nation is called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Zion</span><span class="font4"> after its mother. It was foreshadowed on earth by a capital city of the same name, Zion, whose first king was David of the tribe of Judah, and which city ruled over the nation of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> David, in order to reign in Zion, first had to endure the pain and travail of fighting to oust the heathen enemies from the stronghold of Zion and then make it his royal capital. Thereby the complete occupancy of the city of Jerusalem was gained. (2 Sam/u:6-9) Thither King David brought his royal household, and there his successor, Solomon, was born. (2 Sam. 12: 24, 25) In the day of Jehovah, however, the birth of the “man child” Government takes place before the “war in heaven”. After that fight to oust the devilish enemies of freedom the bringing forth of the other “children” or members of the free Nation takes place. Although the Anointed King of the Nation is heavenly, he was once on earth and called “The Son of man”; and the other members of the Nation are also called from among men, to be “born in Zion”, the highest privilege. It being therefore no earthly nation, those called to be members thereof may not, while on earth, subvert, meddle in or interfere with the political organization of any worldly nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The capital city or ruling organization which the Most High God has chosen and which he put in power in 1914 is Zion, or the New Jerusalem. This was pictured long ago in the action Jehovah God took in the affairs of the nation of Israel; of which this is written: “He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.” (Ps. 78:67,68,70) Jehovah God therefore used the nation of Israel under King David to picture the free spiritual Nation, of which his Son, Christ Jesus, “the Lion of the tribe of Juda,” is the</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4 . How does the beginning of David's reign on Mount Zion differ from the birth of the “man child” Government, and why is it no earthly nation’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5 How was God’s choice of his ruling organization long ago pictured, and of whom or how many is the membership of that nation composed’ 201</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Lord of lords, and King of kings”. He is the Head of the Nation, and all his followers who prove faithful in his footsteps to the death are the members of his ro\al “body”. The Scriptures definitely state that the membership of this National body’ is 144,000 and One, Christ Jesus being the Head One and representing the entire Nation of spiritual Israelites.—Rev. 7: 4-8; 14:1, 3; 20:4, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The wicked adversary of Jehovah and Christ Jesus is that “accuser of our brethren”, Satan the Devil. The city or ruling organization which he opposes against Zion is made up of wicked spirits like himself and also of official representatives among men. It is called “Babylon”. It was pictured by that ancient foe of freedom, Babylon, the oppressor city on the river Euphrates. Babylon was founded by Nimrod, who defied Jehovah as God, put the people in fear of himself, took away their liberties, set himself up as the first human king on earth, and established religion over his subject people. Only true worshipers of Jehovah God, such as Noah, Shem, and other faithful ancestors of King David remained free of Nimrod and his political, commercial, religious organization, Babylon. Satan's visible organization not merely included the city of Babylon on the Euphrates, but took in “all the kingdoms of the world”. Satan himself so declared to Christ Jesus when tempting Jesus with the bait of world rulership if He would renounce Jehovah God and fall down and worship Jehovah's adversary.—Matt. 4:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Satan's organization Babylon, therefore, included the nation of Moab. This nation lay on the eastern side of the Dead sea opposite from the tribe of Judah. Being a part of Satan’s organization and hence representing it, the religious nation of Moab became a symbol of Satan’s organization as a whole. The capital or chief city of Moab was named “Ar”, which means “city’'”; and it is sometimes spoken of in prophecy as standing for the whole nation of Moab. (Num. 21:15,28; Deut. 2:9,18,29; Isa. 15:1) The lofty city of Ar and the entire nation of Moab were the continual foes of God’s chosen nation, from and after the time that they refused to supply provisions to the Israelites when journeying to the Promised Land and hired the unfaithful prophet Balaam to curse the Israelites and to lay a religious trap of Baal-worship for them. (Numbers 22,23,24; 25:1-5) Hence God’s instruction to the Israelites was: “Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.”—Deut. 23: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Moab showed great pride in itself, but contempt for God’s chosen nation. They enjoyed considerable economic prosperity and the resulting wealth and treasure. (Jer. 48: 7, 26, 27, 29, 33, 36) Their counterparts today are the religionists of “Christendom&quot;, namely, the religious, commercial and political leaders who practice religion for selfish gain, making commerce out of religion. “Christendom” today compares with the lofty city of Ar of Moab. She is the loftiest “city” on earth, making practically all the rest of the earth her colonial possession for selfish exploitation. “Christendom” is the most powerful section of the visible part of Satan’s organization Babylon. The modern-time Moabites are proud. They have great contempt for the spiritual Israelites of today, those who are begotten of God’s spirit and called to be members of his “holy nation”, Zion. They are for always opposed to the kingdom of God, and they conspire with all other worldly powers against those spiritual Israelites on earth who visibly represent the Kingdom. (Ps. 83:3-8) The modern Moabites exalt themselves against the Holy City, Jehovah’s kingdom, and, in opposing its rule of the earth, they are against the freedom of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHECY OF DOOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The day of Jehovah, beginning in 1914, is the appointed time for him to settle the score with all his opposers, including the modern Moabites and their mighty city. This he does by the birth of the new Nation, his kingdom, pictured by the mountain of Zion. Commercial “Christendom” and her worldly allies refuse to acknowledge the newborn Nation and its rulership, and tumultuously assemble their mmht to maintain world domination by an association of nations, a global government. Concerning those events of the day of Jehovah his prophet foretold, saying: “Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult! or should peoples mutter an empty thing? The kings of earth take their station, and grave men have met by appointment together, against Jehovah and against his Anointed One [saying]: Let us break asunder their bonds, and cast from us their cords! He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh, my Lord will mock at them: then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his wrath confound them: Yet I have installed my king, on Zion my holy mountain.” —Ps. 2:1-6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah’s right hand is one of almighty power applied in behalf of righteousness. It now tests in his capital organization Zion, and will deal blows of destruction against the modern Moabites and their lofty religious city. On the day of Jehovah this must occur, and of this the prophecy says: “For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord [Jehovah] rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 What is Jehovah’s right hand, where does it now rest and how will He spread forth his hands in the midst of modern Moab? </span><span class="font4">straw is trodden down for the dunghill. And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim.” That is, as the swimmer in the Orient swims hand over hand, beating the water with powerful blows and a loud noise, so Jehovah by his installed King on Mount Zion will smite the modern Moabites and their commercialized religious organization repeatedly with hard, swift blows, right and left, as He advances his cause in the very midst of his enemies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> “And he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.” (Isa. 25:10-12) Instead of Jehovah and his kingdom, the modern Moabites of “Christendom” make religion and their association of nations, fortified by military power, their high tower of defense behind the walls of which to take refuge. (Pss. 9:9; 46:7,11; 59:6,16; Jer. 48:1; marginal readings) By his judgment messages against religion as delivered by his faithful witnesses since 1918 Jehovah God has dealt crushing blows to “Christendom” and the international supergovernment which she now proposes to bring out of the pit of inaction and revive. These messages of truth and prophecy are merely preliminary to the violent smiting which He will give “Christendom” at the execution of these judgments in the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, the battle of Armageddon.—Rev. 16:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The prophecy of the doom of modern Moab, “Christendom,” continues, illustrating how the God of righteousness humbles the proud religionist organization and exalts his approved organization that worships him in faithfulness and that praises his name. “In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.” (Isa. 26:1) That day is the “day of Jehovah of hosts” beginning with the birth of his Theocratic Government by Christ and ending with the vindication of His name at the battle of Armageddon. It is a day when the prophecy of Christ Jesus comes true, that kingdom should rise against kingdom, and total nation against total nation, and that famines, pestilences, persecution of Christians, and continual “distress of nations, with perplexity<sup>7</sup>’, should disturb “Christendom” and her religious hierarchy. These things are visible signs that the “Avar in heaven” began in 1914 and that the invisible demon part of Satan’s organization Babylon has been cast out of heaven and brought down to the earth and made the footstool of Zion’s King, Christ Jesus. It is a day of general disillusionment</span></p></li></ul>

On Jehovah’s day. whose special prophecy comes true, and how? and what success do &quot;Christendom&quot; and religion have? </span><span class="font4">for all peoples, and by it “Christendom” and religion have not been exalted and glorified in the minds of the people, but all is uncertainty, unsettlement, and revolutionary movement. Religion and “Christendom” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font4"> failed the people. Religion will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font4"> fail when she gets on top of the international peace machinery after the total war and seeks to ride it to security and prosperity and lasting peace.</span></p></li></ul>

The prophecy answers: Those “in the land of Judah”. Judah was the land of which Zion was the capital city, and where its king “sat on the throne of Jehovah” as His Theocratic representative. Judah, therefore, now pictures the earthly condition of those who are in line for membership in the heavenly Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization. These have consecrated themselves to its interests and faithfully hold fast to it as the only rightful Ruling Power of the earth. The name </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judah </span><span class="font4">means </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">praise</span><span class="font4"> and was given in praise to Jehovah God. (Gen. 29:35) The people in the covenant with God and who praise his name Jehovah are those in the “land” singing the song, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses. Such praise rs of Jehovah today are the remnant of those to whom the apostle Peter writes, saying : “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” —1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> As the Lord God by Christ Jesus interprets his prophecies to his witnesses, they discern that Babylon has been dislodged from heaven and that the lofty religious organization of modern Moab has been rejected of him, its religion has been exposed as being demonism, and the city of “Christendom” is doomed to utter destruction at Armageddon. As Jehovah’s witnesses .they take up his judgments as written beforehand against His enemies and declare them against these opposers of the newborn Nation, God’s kingdom with Christ Jesus in the throne. As against such bad news for the enemy, they sing forth good news for all “men of good-will” who long for deliverance from Babylon’s abominations and oppressions and who pine for security, peace, prosperity and life-long happiness under a lasting, righteous organization. The singers of Judah, or Judeans, sing out fearlessly to all: “We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.” (The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font4"> Bible inserts the word “Zion” into this text.)</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">14. According to divine interpretation of prophecy, what do they discern respecting Satan's organization’ and what do they declare against the enemy, and what to all &quot;men of good-will&quot;?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> It is Zion of which these “Judeans” are singing, the strong and invincible Theocratic Government of the true and living God. It was exalted to power with the enthronement of Christ Jesus as King of the new Nation, the &quot;holy nation”, in 1914. Its strength was at once demonstrated by the war waged against Babylon, Satan's mighty world organization, which was beaten and thrust down to the earth to stay down and out. Of Zion’s King it was prophesied: “The Lord [Jehovah] shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:1, 2) His rod of strength will shortly “strike through kings in the day of his wrath”, and Zion will remain victorious in the field.—Ps. 110: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> An international police force, no matter of what strength and striking power, cannot guarantee a durable peace with freedom and security, nor will it be able to stand the terrible shaking of all man-made, artificial things at Armageddon. The one and only hope of lovers of life and liberty is God’s &quot;strong city”, The Theocracy. Those who take refuge in and under it find themselves encircled with indestructible walls and bulwarks of God’s protection and power, and which he has appointed to guarantee the salvation, security, deliverance and endless freedom of all who faithfully abide there. This is the truth! even though the dwellers in the lofty city of the modern Moabites scoff, and deny and try to suppress “this gospel of the kingdom”. The choice must be made by the people, either to trust in the postwar supernational &quot;city” of men's creation and take refuge in it, or to heed the Judeans’ song of the &quot;strong city” of God's kingdom and to haste to it for safety and preservation, in hope of life in a righteous new world. The prophecy declares that the song should be sung in this day of Jehovah, and all efforts of the “Moabites” will fail to quiet the song of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions of “good-will”. The word of God’s prophecy will not return unto him void, unfulfilled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NATION THAT KEEPS TRUTHS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The Kingdom of saving strength has been put in operation, and the way to its salvation has been cast up and thrown open in this glorious day of Jehovah. Through the prophecy the Lord God causes the command to go forth to the King of his “strong city”, Zion: “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font4"> which keepeth truths] may enter in.” (Isa. 26: 2) At Christ’s coming in his kingdom he is attended by all his holy angels, and these he uses to carry out Jehovah’s command as gatekeepers. The “gates” were flung</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 Of what do those &quot;Judeans” sing, and how was it and will It yet be demonstrated to be a &quot;strong&quot; city?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">16 (a) Why. then, is God’s &quot;strong city&quot; the only hope for life and liberty, and between what, therefore, must the people choose? &lt;b&gt; Will ••this song&quot; be sung, and why’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">17 To whom was the command to ‘open the gates’ addressed, when were they opened and who were first to enter in? </span><span class="font4">open after his coming to the temple for judgment in 1918. This was immediately after having cast Satan and his demons out of heaven, whereby mighty Babylon suffered a fall from which she will never rise. The prophecy (Isa. 66: 7, 8) foretold that after the “man child”, or Government of the new Nation, had been brought forth to power and Zion had successfully come through the travail of the “war in heaven”, then she would bring forth her other “children”. The Scriptures disclose that after Christ’s coming to temple judgment in 1918 he raised the faithful ones who had been called to the Kingdom and who had faithfully followed him and were then sleeping in death. The sleeping saints were thus brought forth and acknowledged and identified as members and joint heirs with the King Christ Jesus in the capital organization Zion.—1 Thess. 4:13-16; 1 Cor. 15: 49-57.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> As for the remnant who were alive on earth and seeking to serve the Kingdom interests, Christ Jesus on his throne at the temple judged them. He examined how they kept their integrity under the test then sorely trying God’s consecrated people, and how they were volunteering for the witness work, the &quot;song” that was yet to be “sung in the land of Judah&quot; to the praise of the Most High God, the Father of the new Nation. During and for a short time after World War I the religious enemies of the truth and their allies had brought those of the faithful remnant into captivity and had sought the spiritual death of these, if not, also, their physical extinction. Now, by His wondrous acts of deliverance and by the enlightenment and freeing power of the truth, Jehovah’s Kinu brought forth these prisoners of the enemy and set their feet on the highway to Zion, Jehovah's Theocratic organization. The remnant must be brought into it as approved members of Zion. Jehovah's acknowledgment of them as approved ones in line for the Kingdom constitutes Zion’s bringing foi th on earth of her other children. These are then anointed of the Lord God to be his visible representatives of Zion, the capital organization. “The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob Glorious things are spoken of thee, 0 city of God.&quot; —Ps. 87:2,3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Isaiah’s prophecy represents the remnant as approached unto the city and outside her walls, when the call from heaven goes forth: “Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay)</span><span class="font4"> The remnant are in line to be of that “holy nation”, The Theocratic Government, which is a righteous nation and a just. They ‘seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness’, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">18 Concerning what did the Judge Christ Jesus examine the remnant, and how did Zion bring these forth on earth as her other children' 19 Where does the prophet Isaiah represent the remnant as standing, from what had they been purged, and what words of the psalmist do they say? </span><span class="font4">greatest work of righteousness is the vindication of His name. Under the pressures of World War I they had been in large measure guilty of iniquity of lip, refraining from publishing the name and kingdom of God as commanded and as obligated to do in fulfillment of their covenant with him. Now by the power of his spirit and of his truth Jehovah’s King at the temple purges them from that unrighteousness of lip and fills them with courage and boldness to be his witnesses. Therefore the delivered remnant rejoice in the Lord’s salvation and say: “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death [at the hands of the enemy]. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord: this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.”—Ps. 118:17-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The truth is not a religion, but is the righteous laws and commandments of Jehovah God, and the faithful testimony concerning his name and purpose and Theocratic Government, and the reliable, enduring, fixed and incontrovertible facts concerning his works and doings toward his favored people and against his wicked enemies. Jehovah is a “God of truth”, and his Word is the truth. “The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law. All thy statutes are truth: . . . For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven. Thy truth unto all generations.” (Ps. 118: 85, 86, 89, 90, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douai/)</span><span class="font4"> “All his works are done in truth.” (Ps. 33:4) “Thou art near, 0 Lord: and all thy ways are truth.” (Ps. 118:151, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font4"> “The works of his hands are truth and judgment. All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity.” (Ps. 110:7,8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font4"> The King of His righteous nation, when faced with death on the tree, refused to deny the truth, and said to the Roman governor. Pontius Pilate : &quot;I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.”—John 18:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The King now bears the title “The Faithful and True Witness”, and all of his free nation hear his voice of testimony and are of the truth. The remnant of his free nation whom Zion has brought forth as her children after her travail of “war in heaven” must imitate their King and bear witness to the truth of God’s kingdom. They do not follow religion and its fables and traditions of men and its works of selfdeception, but follow and obey and do the truth. Therefore at the temple judgment their King and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 (a) What is the truth’ (b) What relation do Jehovah and his King have to the truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">21 (a) How must the remnant of the free nation imitate their King* (t) Being in hne for the &quot;royal priesthood&quot;, what must they keep, and how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge purged the remnant of all soils of contact with religion. Then he gave them the truth and thus a clean identification as Christians and witnesses of Jehovah God. (Zech. 3:1-5) As being lined up for membership in the “royal priesthood”, they must keep the truth. “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips.” (Mal. 2:7,6) They keep the truth, not by remaining silent about it, for that would mean denying the truth by letting the error stand unchallenged. They keep the truth both by being faithful to it and by telling it out to others. “A faithful witness will not lie.” (Prov. 14: 5) The continual giving forth of the truth fixes it more deeply and ineras-ably in the heart and mind of the truthteller.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> God has favored no other people on earth with the truth than the remnant of his Theocratic organization. (Ps. 147:19,20) This divine grace has not been restricted to them for their selfish enjoyment, but that they might “arise and shine” and be witnesses of Kingdom truth in all the world for a witness to all nations. “The lips of the righteous feed many: . . . The lips of the wise disperse knowledge.” (Prov. 10:21; 15:7) The Lord has turned to his tried and faithful remnant of people a “pure lip, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent”. (Zeph. 3:9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin) </span><span class="font4">The approved and anointed remnant will continue to preach “this gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness” down till the final end of this world comes, regardless of the hatred and violent opposition of all nations. Thus, by God’s grace, they prove themselves as of that “nation which keepeth the truth”. No one that loves the lies of religion can be of that nation and enter into Zion. (Rev. 21:27) No lover of religious lies can be associated with that nation, and those “strangers” of good-will who now become the companions of the remnant must likewise love the truth and must keep it by faithfully witnessing to it.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> It is a time of intense and bitter opposition to the truth and its proclamation. For the hardening of the remnant and their companions in their purpose to serve the Lord and show forth his praises, the prophetic word says to Him: “Thou wilt keep </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">him</span><span class="font4"> in perfect peace, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">whose</span><span class="font4"> mind </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font4"> stayed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">on thee:</span><span class="font4"> because he trusteth in thee.” (Isa. 26: 3) The italicized words in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> reading of this text show themselves to be insertions; and a more literal and</span></p></li></ul>

For in Thee it is confident.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font4"> Or: “A purpose sustained thou wilt guard, [saying] Prosper! Prosper! because in thee hath he been led to trust.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mind</span><span class="font4"> is that faculty of the brain with which we gather information and reach a conclusion; but the word that the prophet here uses means, not the faculty with which to think, but the thing thought or framed in the mind. (Isa. 29:16) The thing that fills the mind of Jehovah’s remnant and their companions is not a vain imagination, but is a knowledge of His purpose. God's purpose has been revealed and made clear to them, namely, to maintain His universal domination and to vindicate His holy name by His kingdom under Christ Jesus. This divine purpose the Almighty God sustains and will make it to continue prospering until it is consummated in a finished reality to the glory of his name. He declares: “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.”—Isa. 46:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>‘ The purpose of His covenant people now is in harmony with the divine purpose. Their resolve is to declare Jehovah’s name, which name stands for his purpose toward his creatures, and to obey his commandments for the furtherance of his irresistible purpose. His purpose is that his name shall be declared by them throughout all the earth before he shows his power over Satan the Devil and all his organization. (Ex. 9:16) Because of the stiffening opposition of the modern Moabites, the remnant and their companions do not drop their purpose to keep their integrity toward God and to be faithful witnesses that endure unto the end. Under all the pressure, crowding and encroachments of the enemy they sustain their one purpose, without even the thought of its abandonment. Having consecrated and entered into a covenant to serve the Most High God, whose name is Jehovah, and knowing that Jehovah’s purpose does not change but will triumph over all opposition, they establish themselves in their own purpose to colabor with God, no matter how long it takes. Nothing do they permit to separate them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus; and of them it is written: “Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.”—Ps. 112: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> In this purpose and determination Almighty God also sustains, upholds and stays them up, because it is in harmony with his own will and purpose. (Pss.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">37:17,24 ; 54:4; 3:5; 51:12; Isa. 59:16) He guards them therein, and answers their prayer amidst this total war: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118:25) He blesses their faithful keeping to their purpose with progress, granting them victories over the modern Moabites and also success in ‘fishing’ and ‘hunting* for the scattered and strayed “other sheep” of the Lord. (Jer. 16:16) He unites his people in this one approved purpose, and keeps them in peace among themselves that their lips may not be diverted from this righteous purpose. As it is written: “I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” (Isa. 57:19,21) And why does the Lord thus bless them, and why are they able to be strong, uncompromising and unchangeable in their purpose! The prophecy answers with this response to the Lord: “Because he trusteth in thee.” —Isa. 26: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Having stated the above guiding rule or principle, the prophet exhorts the remnant of the righteous, truth-keeping nation: “Trust ye in Jehovah for ever, for in Jah Jehovah is a rock of ages.” (Isa. 26:4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young)</span><span class="font4"> The “rock of ages” denotes “everlasting strength”, immovable, inexhaustible. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Authorized Version)</span><span class="font4"> Christ Jesus is the Rock upon which he builds his church, but Jehovah God is the overtowering “Rock of ages”. To Him the prophet Moses sang: “I will proclaim the name of Jehovah : ascribe ye greatness unto our God. The Rock, his work is perfect.” (Deut. 32:3,4, Am. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> “There is none holy as Jehovah; for there is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God.” (1 Sam. 2:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev.

<p><span class="font4">” Men are now beginning to put their trust in a new idol, the new order of international collaboration, to save themselves from a third World War and to secure for them and for their posterity the “four freedoms”.

(Matt. 24:15,16) Conditions may become ever so threatening, the wicked may spring as the grass, and the workers of iniquity may flourish in their global new order; they may finally close in on us to ‘eat up our flesh’, yet we may unwaveringly trust for ever in Jehovah. He ‘will set us up on a rock’ unassailable and unascendable by our bloodthirsty foes.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ABASEMENT AND EXALTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’• The capital city of the proud, wealthy Moabites was built on an eminence or hill that commanded all the surrounding plain. The postwar super-government of “Christendom<sup>-</sup>’ and of all the globe will he built on high, and the “great whore<sup>-</sup>’ of Babylon will ride that many-headed creature. As it is written: “And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.” (Rev. 17:1-6, 18) That lofty city will not reign over Jehovah’s faithful, trusting remnant and their companions, and will therefore try to tread these lowly ones lifeless to the ground. However, these “poor and needy” ones may keep their trust unshaken in Jehovah, because, when the “international new order” oppressors reach the peak of their power and domination, then the prophecy will be fulfilled: “For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.” (Isa. 26: 5, G) But Zion, our strong city, will continue exalted forevermore.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Zion, Jehovah’s capital organization under Christ, is Theocratic. Therefore those who are born in her keep her regulations, because these are from God, who is the Head of Zion and of her King Christ Jesus. The faithful remnant have always desired to walk in the way of His regulations. It is a matter of eternal life that they do so now, because it is the day of judgment since the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918. Jehovah is the Most Upright One.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> During the night of darkness which descended upon the consecrated ones about 1918 by reason of the action of the modern Moabites and their religious allies, the faithful longed for light and the execution of the Lord’s judgments for their deliverance. They sought him early, immediately after the close of World War I, desiring to know his regulations governing their future course of conduct. Then the Loid led them over the highway, the way of holiness, to Zion and to service in his Theocratic organization. The reproach which rested upon the Lord's memorial name because of their captivity and inactivity they longed to see lifted through their deliverance. So Jehovah, by his Elect Servant Christ Jesus, loosed them from their restraints, and now they freely and boldly sing forth his name, showing that Jehovah i<sup>1</sup>-the name of the true God, who is their Liberator and the Liberator of all them that now seek him.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> By the Lord’s revealed judgments and regulations the faithful remnant have learned righteousness and therefore shun the worldly contamination and unrighteousness of religion. The “strangers” within their midst, the Lord’s “other sheep&quot;, have heard the judgments of Jehovah God proclaimed by His remnant of witnesses. Such of them as have already heeded the Kingdom message of this day of judgment have done good to the brethren of the King Christ Jesus and thus have learned righteousness Their righteous acts of faith are seen in their zealous work in the witness field at the side of the remnant, the King’s brethren. More of these good-will “inhabitants of the world” will yet learn righteousness as a certain result of the continued proclamation of truth by the remnant and their companions. Such “inhabitants” will both learn and then do righteousness, as now commanded: “Seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”—Zeph. 2: 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

The Lord’s “other sheep’’ are severed away from the wicked &quot;goats”. Great favor or mercy has been shown to these “goats” to permit them to remain till now and to have an equal opportunity with the “sheep” to hear the Kingdom message. The remnant and their “sheep” companions are walking openly before all the world in the “land of uprightness” as witnesses to the majesty of God’s kingdom; and Jehovah has manifestly uplifted his hand for their deliverance, protection, guidance and prosperity in His service. The religionists have been able to observe all this zeal of Jehovah's people and to profit by it, if they will. But do they? The prophecy answers: &quot;Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah. Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see thy zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.” (Isa. 26:10,11, A»i. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah’s covenant people are hereby advised that they may expect to brush up with the wicked “Moabites” and their allies and to fight against their encroachments continuously until the judgment fire of the battle of Armageddon devours such opposers and persecutors.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” The remnant and their companions shun all dealings with such wicked ones and waste no consecrated time in controversies with them, but let them go their own willful, stubborn way and take the consequences of which they have been forewarned. We seek no debates or controversial arguments with those who refuse to see and who envy the zeal of God’s people. It is now a time of “peace to men of good-will”; and Jehovah God has appointed the way of peace for his remnant and “other sheep”. The war of Armageddon is ordained for the wicked, with destruction of all their works; but as for the Lord’s zealous and courageous witnesses the prophecy says: “Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.” (Isa. 26:12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

To Him must go all the credit for-the success, progress and prosperity of the witness work till now and of that which will climax his “strange work” in the near future. Were it not that He has “wrought all our works for us”, this visible organization and its work would have come to nought in that crucial year of 1940. But men cannot overthrow it, because in reality they are fighting against God in trying to do so. (Acts 5:38,39) Al-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FREE FROM OTHER LORDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Having now passed through the wide-open gates and entered in within Zion’s walls and bulwarks of salvation (Isa. 60:11), these delivered and protected ones can take up the next words of the prophet and say: “0 Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased [ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)</span><span class="font4"> they are Rephaim], they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.”—Isa. 26: 13,14, .1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">m. Rev. Ver.</span><span class="font4"> (Rephaim giants once occupied Moabite territory.—Deut. 2:11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The modern Moabites have tried to lord it over the Lord Jehovah’s people, till within recent years. Today they are pushing the idea that all peoples, including Jehovah’s covenant people, are the property of the State and that &quot;Caesar” has the prior and sole claim upon them. The religious element among the “Moabites” have persuaded the political element like King Eglon of old to believe themselves to be “the higher powers”. Down to the year 1929 even Jehovah’s witnesses had not been delivered from the popular view that the political rulers of this world are the &quot;higher powers” to whom Christian souls are commanded by God to be subject. But by publishing the truth on Romans 13:1-7, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtouer </span><span class="font4">of June, 1929, the remnant were given the freedom of the truth that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are exclusively “The Higher Powers”, whom Christians must obey rather than obey men opposed. The year previous, namely, in 1928, by the publication of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font4"> the Lord God also revealed to them that “Christianity is not a religion”, but is of the truth. It w’as because of not understanding these vital facts of truth that God’s consecrated people succumbed to conspiring religious, political and commercial elements in 1918 and fell into captivity and permitted other lords to regulate, hinder and restrain their Christian activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ In ancient times the Moabites under fat King Eglon oppressed Jehovah’s people eighteen years. Correspondingly, eighteen years after 1918, or in 1936, Jehovah God made emphatic to his people the truth that all religion is of the Devil. Hence during those intervening eighteen years, and particularly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">34 Having passed within Zion's gates, what do the delivered ones then confess and say. according to prophecy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">35 How. and till when, had other lords besides Jehovah had dominion over his consecrated people*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">36 Since 1918. like whom have Jehovah's remnant prepared themselves against modem Moabites and then struck for freedom, and likewise the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot;? </span><span class="font4">since 1929, when the persecutions upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and America and elsewhere began to increase in severity and magnitude, his remnant under Christ Jesus prepared themselves like Judge Ehud, the ambidextrous Benjamite. The Lord provided the remnant with the large dagger of these Theocratic truths. Then, in His due time, particularly from 1936 on, Christ Jesus by his remnant on earth lias plunged the cold steel into the paunch of pudgy King Eglon and caused his dirt to be exposed. (Judg. 3: 12-30) Since then, also, the Lord's ’‘other sheep” have been fulfilling the picture of the Kenite woman named Jael, who took the hammer and tentpin and nailed the head of King Eglon's fellow conspirator, Captain Sisera, to the ground. (Judg. 4: 18-24) Thereafter, according to the ancient type, the power of the Moabites and of the Canaanites over Jehovah's chosen nation was broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> Today, as a result of like action, the totalitarian monstrosity and the religious lords are as dead to Jehovah's people. Spiritually, therefore, Jehovah's remnant of witnesses are free, thus fitly representing on earth His righteous and holy nation, the new Nation of Zion. The Jael class, or “other sheep”, are standing unbreakably with the remnant in this freedom wherewith Jehovah by Christ Jesus has made them free; and together they all say now, this very day: “0 Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.” The political powers, with the full connivance of religious clergy, may take Jehovah’s people into custody by sheer physical force. They may deprive them of their unrestrained bodily moveinent in a concentration camp, and may ban them, as in Germany. But always and for ever they fail to crack and bind the spirit of truth and freedom within the hearts of Jehovah's faithful ones; and the making mention of His name and purpose continues to go on, as in Nazi Germany, where the Hitlerites find the underground witness work to be the one that they cannot control, break up or subdue, as reported by the Munich newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Neueste Naclu ichten</span><span class="font4"> as recently as June of this year. (Boston C. S. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Monitor,</span><span class="font4"> June 29, 1943, page 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The judgments of the Lord written aforetime in his &quot;Word have had bold declaration and doomed those “lords” to destruction. They are for ever dead to the Lord’s people already and shall never again live as “higher powers” to them. They are deceased; and those “Rephaim”, or totalitarian and religious giants of Satan’s demonized organization, shall never again rise to spiritual power over Jehovah’s “free nation” and put them in any bondage to the Lord's enemies, either now or in the postwar period of a super-State, dominated by religion. Till Armageddon’s fight they may continue to trouble Jehovah's people, as did that Moabite named “Sanbailat the Horonite”, who accused Nehemiah of sedition and tried to lure or frighten him off from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. But Nehemiah armed his builders and met Sanballat’s threat with the command to the workers on the wall: “Fight for your brethren!” and Jerusalem’s walls were built to completion. (Neh. 2:10,19; 4:1-14; 6:1-16) Finally, when those who have in the past lorded it over Jehovah’s people do die and decease at Armageddon’s war of execution, they shall literally go into extinction, without hope of rising and living in the new world which is without end. The sanctimonious harlot of religion leads them down thither. (Prov. 2:16-18; 9:13-18; 21:16) Jehovah's judgments proclaimed by his witnesses have already visited them and greatly incensed them; but at Armageddon the execution of those judgments will visit and punish them, and Jehovah will destroy them, without a trace left, thus making every memorial of them to perish. The New World shall be free for “men of good-will”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> Before that execution, and while those doomed “lords” and ’’Rephaim” are permitted to remain but a short time longer to defiantly oppose the Theocratic Government by Christ, the Lord God of the remnant continues to increase his free Nation. Therefore the prophecy addresses itself to God, saving: “Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.” (Isa. 26:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Concerning the Government which reSvS upon the shoulder of the Prince of Peace it is written: “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom,, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.” (Isa. 9: 6, 7) That Government knows no national borders on earth, but will exercise world domination over the globe; for God has removed all restricting borders “far unto all the ends of the earth”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Auth. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> All the inhabited earth becomes the territory in which “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached . . . for a witness unto all nations” before the final end of them and their lords comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>90</sup> As Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to his command to preach, have gone to as many of the nations as they could penetrate by personal house-to-house witnessing, and by printed page, radio, telephone and underground, our only Lord God has added to the</span></p>

He not only has gathered the Ruth and Esther class, or newer and younger part of the remnant class, unto Zion within the gates of our “strong city<sup>-</sup>’, but has also added the “strangers” that are welcome “within thy gates”. These “other sheep” the Good Shepherd has apparently only begun to bring into his fold into company with his free Nation represented by the remnant. The prophecy says: “Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.” (Zech. 2:4) The increasing of the Lord’s Nation has therefore not yet reached to the populousness he has decreed for it before Armageddon finishes off the envious opposers of such increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The increase thus far is to Jehovah’s glory. By a still greater increase and addition of “other sheep” He shall be further glorified among multitudes of “men of good-will” from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof. How, then, can we but continue to sing this song of His praise in the land of Judah in this day of Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">41. Who has thereby been glorified, and how may he be still further glorified?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark22"></a>THE CREATOR OF</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">FORM the light, and create darkness; I make peace, I and create evil; I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things?’ No self-contradiction is in that statement of the Most High God, as recorded at Isaiah 45: 7 (Am. Kev. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ver.).</span><span class="font4"> It has been misunderstood by religionists, and by reason thereof Jehovah God has been misrepresented. Jehovah is good, and all his ways are right. (Ps. 25: 8) Every good and perfect thing proceeds from him. (Jas. 1:17) Hence many have taught that it would be impossible for him to create anything that would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evil.</span><span class="font4"> The difficulty arises from wrongly understanding the term </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evil.</span><span class="font4"> Worldly dictionaries define </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evil</span><span class="font4"> as “anything having bad moral qualities, corrupt, wicked or wrong”. To be sure, Jehovah God could not create anything or practice anything that possesses bad moral qualities or that is corrupt or wicked or that is wrong, because 'all his works are perfect’. (Deut. 32:4) God is his own interpreter of his Word on this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another translator, Rotherham, renders Isaiah 45:7 in this manner: “I am Jehovah, and there is none else: forming light and creating darkness, making prosperity and creating misfortune.” That God creates evil there cannot be the slightest doubt, because his Word so says. There is a wide difference, however, between evil and that which is morally wicked or wrong. According to the Scriptures </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evil</span><span class="font4"> in this and like texts means that which brings adversity or hurt, affliction or sorrow. It is not necessarily morally wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Death is a great evil. It is the very opposite of life, and no greater misfortune could befall any creature than to lose his life. Death brings adversity, hurt, affliction or sorrow to those who were the friends of the deceased. It was Jehovah God who provided death as the penalty for the violation of his law, as stated at Genesis 2 17. It was not wrong for him to do so, but it was right for him to fix the severest punishment for the deliberate violation of his law. He created man, and his creative work “was very good”. (Gen. 1:31) It was God’s will that adversity should not befall his creature man; therefore he commanded him not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree, and informed man that if he willfully violated God’s law evil would befall him, which evil or adversity would be death. The evil which God had created, and which fell so heavily upon Adam, was not wrong, but right. It was a just punishment for the willful violation of God’s word. The rightful and just enforcement of that law brought the greatest adversity, sorrow and af-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark24"></a>PEACE AND EVIL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">fliction upon Adam and upon his offspring and has affected the entire human race.—Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God, as the scripture states, created light. “Light is sown for the righteous,” or those who do right. (Ps. 97:11) He created darkness, which is the portion of those who willfully continue in wrongdoing. (Ps. 82:5-7, Jude 13; Ps. 107:10; 2 Pet. 2:4) To those who are obedient to him he opens bis hand and fills them with that which is good. (Ps. 104: 28) “For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” “The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. Upon the wicked ho shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.”—Pss. 84:11; 11:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This divine rule Jehovah plainly announced to the nation of Israel when He directed Moses to state to that people the terms of His covenant with them. If that people would keep His commandment and obey his voice they should prosper and have his blessing: and if they would turn away from Jehovah and disobey him evil would befall them. “See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them ; I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land.”—Deut 30:15-19; also Deut. 31: 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By his prophets God repeatedly warned the Israelites that he would bring evil upon them for their wrongdoing. (Jer. 6:19) The Israelites were God's covenant people and were bound by the terms of the covenant to obey and serve God. Because of their wrongdoing God did bring evil upon them as a punishment therefor. Note Judges 2:13-15 on this: “And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely it cannot be contended that it was wrong for God the Creator to punish the Israelites for a violation of their covenant with him. It was not wrong, but exactly right, for the reason that they had deliberately violated their solemn agreement with Jehovah. God created the evil that befell the Israelites for their wrongdoing, and his action in bringing that evil upon the Israelites was right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What was God’s purpose in thus bringing the evil upon them? Was it merely to give them some experience with evil, that they might thereby learn the baneful effects thereof? No, such was not the reason. The Scriptures plainly state that the “children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord” by forsaking God and serving the Devil. (Judg. 2:11) The evil that they did was a gross sin, and therefore wrong. The Israelites, by the terms of their covenant, were promised life if they would obey God’s law, and were told that death would follow a deliberate violation thereof. The only way creatures can possess and hold eternal life is to know and to obey God. By departing from their covenant the Israelites were destroying their opportunity for life. The name and word of God were involved; and, for their good, Jehovah God would keep before them that he is the only true God and the Giver of life. The action of Jehovah in bringing evil upon the Israelites was not selfish, but was because of his love for them and for the upholding of his word and name. He would have them know that they could not follow or worship the Devil and receive that which they so much desired, namely, life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The law of God was expressed to Israel in these words: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.&quot; (Ex. 20: 3) Uis commandment to them was: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (Matt. 22: 37, 38) Knowing this clear and positive statement of the law and commandments of God and then going contrary thereto revealed to the true Israelites the hideousness of sin, “that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful,” because the sin was not mere immorality but the breaking of their covenant with God. Sin is a transgression of God's law, and to know his law and commandment and then to deliberately violate the same increases the enormity of the wrongdoing and makes such enormity manifest. That is the argument of the apostle Paul in Romans 7 :12-14. The Israelites had agreed to obey God’s law and commandments, and by taking an opposite course they broke their solemn covenant and also broke the law and commandment. For such wrongdoing on their part and as a punishment therefor God brought evil upon them, for their own good. In his so doing, that evil was right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a vast difference between evil and wrongdoing. All wrong or wrongdoing is evil, but not all evil is wrong. An act of injustice is always wrong, and also usually works evil upon another. The administration of justice is right, and often brings evil upon the person against whom it is enforced. Wrong or wrongdoing is always attended by injustice. Evil may be the result of the enforcement of justice or may result therefrom, but wrong could never result from the strict enforcement of justice. Jehovah is the just God, says Isaiah 45:21. The dwelling-place of justice is with him. “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.” (Ps. 89:14) In the administration of justice to his creatures evil or affliction must of necessity result to the wrongdoer. That does not at all argue that it is wrong. On the contrary it fully supports the statement of Isaiah 45: 7 that God creates evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font4"> means that which is right and in full harmony with God’s law. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment</span><span class="font4"> means the judicial determination or decree rendered by one having the rightful authority to do so. When the Psalm declares that ‘justice and judgment are the habitation of Jehovah’s throne’, the meaning is that all the judicial determinations or decrees rendered or made by Jehovah are right; and this is true even though such judicial decrees for the enforcement of justice bring suffering and sorrow, and therefore </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evil,</span><span class="font4"> upon the ones against whom they are enforced. It is the exclusive right of Jehovah to delegate authority to others to render judgment. In delegating such authority to certain ones in his organization of Israel, and commanding that they should administer justice, God declared that there should be no discrimination in so doing. His prophet Moses said, at Deuteronomy 1:17: “Ye shall not respect persons in judgment. but ye shall hear the small as well as the great, ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.” Here Moses typifies or represents Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any judgment or decree made or rendered and enforced because of ill-will, hatred or malice is wrong or unjust On the contrary, a decree or judgment made or rendered and enforced by one possessing the rightful authority and only in the honest administration of justice is right, even though it results in suffering on the part of the one against whom the decree is enforced. Because the enforcement of a just judgment does bring suffering and affliction it is cmI, but is in full harmony with God’s law. Such judgment or decree, however, must always be made and enforced by the one having full power and authority thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were God’s people chosen by him for his organization and they were given instruction in righteousness. What he lequired of them he requires of all whom he approves, to wit, “to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.” (Mic. 6:8) Worldly men have formed nations, made laws, provided for courts or tribunals which have rendered and enforced judgments, but have failed to do so justly because of the imperfection of man and because the nations and peoples of the earth have been and are under the influence and control of the “god of this world”, Satan the Devil. (2 Cor. 4:4, John 12:31) When God’s kingdom is in full sway in the earth, then Christ the King and just Judge will do justly and render all decrees in justice and righteousness. As it is prophetically written of him: “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isa. 11:4-9) All the King’s judgments will be right, but they will work evil to the wicked. “The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is wrong, therefore, for anyone to render or to attempt to render and to enforce against others a judgment or decree that would result in evil, unless the person so rendering such judgment or decree has full authority thus to do. It is therefore clearly seen that evil or punishment administered without authority is wrong, whereas evil resulting from a judgment made or enforced by the rightful authority is right and proper. Hence, too. any judgment or decree that is made, rendered and enforced contrary to God’s law is wrong and evil. It is not of God, to whom the question is raised ■ “Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which [throne] frameth mischief by a law? They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But the Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off.” (Ps. 94:20-23) That means evil, but in righteousness, to such wicked and iniquitous lawmakers who work mischief maliciously against God’s innocent and righteous servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is the God of peace, or prosperity, welfare, happiness, health and safety. Romans 16: 20 says • “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly ” This implies that he is also the God of war, because he will make war against Satan and will destroy him and his organization. Jehovah God fought for his covenant people Israel of old time, and will now fight for those of his Theocratic organization at his own due time. (2 Chron. 20- 15. Zech. 14:3) In response to the cries of his oppressed people Jehovah will express his righteous indignation against the oppressors, and He is therefore called the military God, or “Lord of sabaoth”, meaning the Lord of hosts (Jas. 5:4) With equal certainty, says Psalm 29- 11, Jehovah “will bless his people with peace”. His kingdom under Christ Jesus will bring peace to “men of good-will” of the earth, but only after the greatest of all wars Armageddon The peace thereafter established shall continue for ever —Ps. 72:3-7; Isa 2:4.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark26"></a>JOSEPH, WISE FOOD ADMINISTRATOR</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">I</span><span class="font4">N TIMES past some people have thought that when an abundant supply of food is produced in a country, the thing to do is to plow under crops and destroy livestock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A different policy seems to be in vogue at present. World food conferences are held, food administrator offices set up, anil other measures adopted to grapple with food-shortage problems. A famous food crisis was surmounted in Egypt over thirty-five centuries ago by Joseph, and his policy was not one of food destruction in times of plenty. Joseph, who, in his office of food administrator, had divine guidance, stored up food. Uis wise course later preserved life, and it, as well as his earlier life history, is prophetic. Hence a review of his life will be both interesting and instructive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time Joseph was born his mother Rachel said: “God hath taken away my reproach”, and she called him “Joseph”, which means “remover”, that is, remoter of reproach. The name also means “increaser”. (Gen. 30:22-24) He it as the firstborn son of Jacob by his wife Rachel, and pictures the first-created and beloved Son of God, Christ Jesus. It is Christ that removes reproach from Jehovah’s name, and gathers and increases the number of those that worship God.—Ps. 50: 5; Jolin 10: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Joseph was 17 years old the events of his life that are historically important began to occur. He had moved from his birthplace in Padan-aram to the land of Canaan. There he was a faithful shepherd lad, tending his father’s flocks with his ten half brothers. His relations with his brethren were strained. In the first place he was the favorite son of Jacob, as evidenced by the gift of a coat of many colors. He faithfully reported to his father the derelictions of his half brothers in their eare of the flock. Most galling of all, this young brother dreamed dreams that indicated his exaltation above them, even picturing the celestial bodies rendering obeisance to him. (Gen. 37:1-11) Likewise Christ Jesus, the Good Shepherd and most highly favored of God’s sons, condemns and exposes the wickedness of the evil shepherds, which truthful reports stir the hatred of such religious ones. And when He, while on earth, declared the prophecies foretelling his exaltation they gnashed their teeth against him.—Phil. 2: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A climax was reached when Joseph’s father sent him to Shechem to see if all was well with the flock. Spying him from afar, the envious half brothers “conspired against him to slay him”. In the end they rid themselves of their tormentor by selling him to merchantmen headed for Egypt (Gen. 37:13-28) Centuries later, in fulfillment of this part of the drama, Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to earth to note the condition of God’s flock and to investigate the Jewish clergy, who were duty-bound to feed the covenant people of God by informing them of His Word The Jewish religionists were his brethren after the flesh, yet they opposed him and “delivered him for envy”—Mark 15 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arriving in Egypt, Joseph was sold by the Ishmaelites to Potiphar, an Egyptian and officer of Pharaoh The Lord prospered Joseph and was with him in all that he did Potiphar noted this, and in time made him overseer of his house and possessions For Joseph’s sake the Egyptian’s house was blessed Thereafter Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph to have intercourse with her. Joseph refused to indulge in such illicit relationship with his master's wife, though she daily importuned him to do so Failing to seduce Joseph and gain her desires, she “framed” him and charged him with attempting the very crime he had steadfastly shunned. On this false charge he was cast into prison. (Gen 39:1-20) At this point Joseph pictured the body members of Christ yet on earth. As Potiphar’s wife was used to test Joseph, so Satan’s “woman”, his organization, is used to put the “feet members” to a severe test of integrity. The world would have Christ’s followers conform themselves to its Godless ways and selfish desires, and join in with its schemes. But no spiritual fornication with the Devil’s “woman” for them! (Jas. 4:4) Because of this the enemy organization makes false accusations against God’s people, even accusing them of sedition because they stand firm for God’s kingdom. On such false charges many were imprisoned during the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While in prison Joseph gained a reputation as an interpreter of dreams, the Lord still being with this man of faith. Joseph gave God the credit, saying: “Do not interpretations belong to God'?” (Gen. 40: 8) Two years pass, with Joseph still in prison. Then Pharaoh dreams. Seven fat-fleshed kine come up out of a river and feed in a meadow. Seven lean-fleshed ones follow, and consume the fat kine. He has a second, similar dream, seven good ears of corn coming up on one stalk, to be later devoured by seven thin ears. All the magicians of Esypt were called in to give the interpretation; all failed! Then the fame of Joseph reached Pharaoh’s ears. In reply to Pharaoh’s request for an interpretation Joseph said: “It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”—Gen. 41:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pharaoh relates his two dreams, and, true to the promise of Joseph, God gives the correct understanding through Joseph. The two dreams are one, and in explaining them Joseph said: “What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land.” (Gen. 41.28-30) Joseph next offered good counsel. He advised Pharaoh to seek out a wise and discreet man to set over the land of Egypt, and outlined a food conservation program to inaugurate during the seven years of plenty, that a surplus might be accumulated for the seven years of famine. He did not advise food destruction to manipulate prices. His aim was to preserve life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pharaoh heeded the counsel. To Joseph he said: “There Is none so discreet and wise as thou art. thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.” (Gen. 41:39, 40) Pharaoh appropriately called Joseph &quot;Zaphnath-paaneah”, meaning &quot;savior of the world” or “food of the living” He also gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of a priest of On, who bore unto him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. Joseph performed his duties as Pharaoh’s prime minister, filling the granaries of Egypt to overflowing. The seven years of plenty ended; famine set in.—Gen. 41: 45-54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All Bible readers are familiar with the trying events of the years that followed. When the Egyptians cried for food, Pharaoh said: “Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.” They brought their money and cattle and herds to Joseph. When these resources were exhausted they sold their lands, and finally themselves, to Pharaoh, all voluntarily. The famine overspread all the earth, and the inhabitants of all countries came into Egypt to buy corn. (Gen. 41:55-57; 47:14-23) Along with them came Joseph’s ten half brothers. The charge laid against them of being spies, the test by which they might prove their innocence, their subsequent return with the young lad Benjamin, and the demonstration of a complete change of heart since their cruel treatment of Joseph over twenty years before, and this climaxed by Joseph’s revealing himself to his brethren, all has been recounted many times, though seldom with an understanding of its significance. After making himself known to his brethren Joseph said: “Be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me be foie you to preserve life ... So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God.” (Gen. 45: 5-8; Ps. 105:16, 17) Beyond question, then, Jehovah was maneuvering events. Subsequently Jacob and his household migrated from Canaan to Egypt, where they were nourished by Pharaoh’s food administrator Joseph for the duration of the famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is the significance of all this today? Briefly, it is as follows: The Greater Joseph, Christ Jesus, at the temple looses the seals and interprets the visions and prophecies of God’s Word, revealing their meaning. (Rev. 5:1-5) Modern-day religious leaders, like the magicians of Egypt, cannot interpret correctly. In the antitypical fulfillment of Pharaoh’s dream the seven years of plenty and seven years of famine run concurrently, picturing the condition in two organizations from the time of Christ’s coming to the temple to Jehovah’s vindication at Armageddon. In God’s organization there is an abundance of spiritual food; in Satan's organization, famine reigns. (Isa. 65:13) As Amos 8:11 says, it is “not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord”. The people of goodwill still held prisoners in Satan’s organization are “ill favoured and leanfleshed” spiritually, but upon coming into God's organization they “shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; . . . for the Lamb [the Greater Joseph] which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the Greater Joseph they must come. He is the “savior of the [new] world” and the “food of the living”, the “living bread . . . from heaven”. (John 6: 49-51) He brings forth “meat in due season” from the Greater Pharaoh's storehouse of plenty, His Word, the Bible. (Prov 2:7, Matt. 4:4; Deut. 8:3) What must the persons of goodwill do to obtain the life-sustaining food from the hands of the Greater Joseph? As did the inhabitants of Egypt, they must come from the world, bringing all their substance to the Lord and presenting their bodies a living offering in Jehovah’s service. A full, complete consecration they make to God, holding back nothing. They realize that nothing they can give can-compensate for the blessings of life which wall be theirs in the New World. They hail the terms as generous, knowing that all belongs to the Lord in the first place. (Ps. 24:1) Christ Jesus will minister life to those of the human race who comply with the terms of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Years after the famine Joseph was blessed by Jacob, and received the birthright. (Gen. 49: 22-26, 1 Chron. 5: 2) lie made a trip into Canaan, to bury his father, and then returned to Egypt, where he died at the age of 110 years By faith he foresaw the time when God would deliver the nation of Israel from Egypt, and requested that his bones be taken along and buried in the Promised Land. (Gen. 50:22, 24, 25; Ex. 13: 19) Joseph receives mention in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews for his outstanding faith, and will be rewarded with a “better resurrection”. (Heb. 11: 22, 35) In the New World he will have administrative responsibilities, serving as one of “new earth’s” princes, applying Theocratic law under the direction of the Greater Joseph in the “new heavens”.—Isa. 32: 1; Ps. 45. 16.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A CHANGED HOME (EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Showing the need of not getting discouraged when a model Bible study does not seem to be going right: I called on a woman whose husband kept interrupting with remarks such as 'We’ve plenty of those books and don’t want any more’. Then he came to the door hoping to floor me with the time-honored ‘chestnut’ of “Where did Cain get his wife?’ He soon beat a retreat! Soon he came back with another sneering question, which likewise received a Scriptural answer. However, the wife asked me to call with the phonographic lecture recordings. This we did; but directly the record was finished the husband said: ‘That was all right, but—’ and then followed a lot of questions about the authenticity of the Bible, the Flood, etc. We covered them all, but did not convince him. Another call was arranged, but this was much like the first, only we left him in a better state of mind. Two other calls were made, but no real study could be held. We wondered whether he just wanted an argument, and decided to make one more call to settle the matter. We had left him the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font4">to read to answer his queries. The next call we found a very marked change in him. Said he: ‘That is a marvelous book, the best I have ever read. The trouble is, you folks make the Bible so darned interesting!’ He asked us to leave the book for another week so that he could get right through it. We called the next week, and found that not only had he finished it, but had got part way through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> as well and was also reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font4"> and both he and his wife had been continually talking about the Kingdom and its joys to one another and to the children. He still requires proof of every statement we make, but his joy, when we can and do prove it from the Bible, ‘is better felt than telt,’ as the Scots say. The wife said: ‘There is a different atmosphere in this house since you folks came; everything seems so much brighter, and we have something to look forward to.’ Now a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book study has started in the home, and the man who said he did not want any books has asked us to get him all we can, so that he can make up his set.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“THEOCRATIC TACTFULNESS” (MILWAUKEE, WIS.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A young woman refused to accept the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font4"> stating she was Catholic and that it would be a sin for her to read any publications not approved by ‘the church’ • ‘I have never seen these publications listed on our approved list, and I am sure the priests must have investigated them; so, if it were not a sin for us to read them, they would have been listed.’ I stated this educational work is designed to stimulate more diligent Bible study on the part of all peoples of all faiths; that Jehovah’s witnesses encourage Catholics as well as all others to study their Bibles. To this she replied: ‘Our priest reads to us from the Bible a text each Sunday. What do these books contain that our priest does not teach us!’ In the past I have always endeavored to answer such a question by discussing the false doctrines of the Catholic sect, such as ‘purgatory’, mass, Peter as the first pope, etc. Having observed that this usually closed the mind of my Catholic listener, I decided to put into practice the things I had learned from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> article ‘Theocratic Tactfulness”. So I sought not to expose the Catholic sect, but</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">spoke of the blessings of the Kingdom. She listened with genuine interest and showed great astonishment when I explained that these were things for which she prayed each time she repeated the Lord’s prayer.

<p><span class="font4">“While visiting here, I witnessed on the street in Saturday’s magazine work. I had been on the street an hour or longer without any placements at all, but not discouraged by this fact, knowing that many passers-by were at least being witnessed to. Then a lady came up to me very friendlily, asking if I’d take a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> She was reading it regularly and enjoyed it so much that she wished to send it to others, refusing, however, to give me her name on account of her position but affirming all her sympathies were xvith us and she was really anxious to read and learn more that she might engage in some work with us in the future. She had all the literature sent to her many friends all over, to the amount of ten percent of her salary regularly. Instead of just one six-month subscription, she gave me three, and also 50c extra to pass out literature to any who would read but not having the contribution. My spirits being bolstered up so much, I wouldn’t have been afraid of the old Devil if he had appeared; which soon it appeared he did in the person of a big, burly soldier, knocking right up against me, gruffly saying: ‘You've got your nerve peddling such trash!’ Whereupon, without losing any of my gained enthusiasm, I quickly answered, never backing up an inch, though his stomach was touching me: ‘If you understood what this was about, you’d not say such; we’re your friends!’ Then he smiled and held out a dime and said: ‘Give me both. You’re right, and I like them. I was just kidding you. Back in Topeka, Kansas, there was a girl came around occasionally to my office with this about an invisible Government. I never thought much of it then, but later I began to see there is something to it sure enough, and I want to learn all about it.’ I tried to take his subscription, but he said he’d take it when he had a sure address; though he gladly took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New World, Peace— Can It Last I</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty.</span><span class="font4"> I noticed a fellow attracted and listening to him talk and lingering on after the soldier had gone on.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and Ais active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“MORE THAN CONQUERORS” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December has been set aside as the Testimony Period above named. Suffice it to say there will be much for each to conquer who takes part therein. All who conquer self-love and who permit nothing to sever them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus will take hold of the privileges of the month. The means of testimony that will be to the forefront will be the latest publications, the book “The Truth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the booklet Freedom in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> both to be presented to all prospects on a 25c contribution. As winter then sets in in the Northern Hemisphere, the placing of the literature should be followed up by starting Bible studies, primarily with the new book, in as many homes of obtainers of literature as possible. Let the testimony thus be most deeply impressed and continue on through the winter-bound months. Your report on service at the month’s close should show, besides literature placed, new book studies requiring back-calls of you. Set your affairs in order now for a conqueror’s part in the campaign with Freedom’s message. Write us direct, if necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">instructions and set the right standard as to this grand privilege of conununion with the mighty Creator. We must go to the Bible for answers to our many questions on this subject and for our model of prayer. The Bible was written by men who were inspired by the unfailing Hearer of prayer and who enjoyed and used the privilege of calling upon him in praise, thanksgiving and request. None of them were religionists. None of them, therefore, went in for the religious practices, formulae and mechanical-routine repetitions of prayers, things that amuse the demons but do not please the true God. The Bible writers showed up the emptiness and uselessness of religious prayers, and set forth in the Record the true and acceptable way to approach the living God. Today numberless prayers are being offered in private homes, in legislatures, on battlefields and on battleships, and in religious buildings, by men and women without respect of their side of the global war. Such prayers from both sides, addressed to the same God, presumably, are all for victory and lasting peace. Such prayers from opposite sides marked also World War I, and other conflicts and tribulations of world]} nations. The settlement of the matter in dispute was determined, not by religious praying of clergy or laity, but by the might of the military winner rather than the righteousness of the cause. Or if there was any settlement approaching righteousness, it did not usher in lasting peace with justice, morality and prosperity for the common man. Of what value actually was the religious praying except as a false bolster to the morale of the loser as well as the winner? The losers lost not only the fight but also faith in prayer and in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ True prayer, offered in the right manner to the right One and on right matters, does count and bring results. The Bible Record gives many examples of praying rightly by men and women. It shows why their action was accepted and responded to by the One addressed. Their cases were written down and preserved for our instruction and encouragement. Religionists look upon the statement at Genesis 4: 2G</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. What kind of prayer does count, and what can be aaid coocerning Genesis 4:26 aa being the first account of prayer by men I</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH is within the reach of prayer by human creatures here on earth. He is not too lofty, nor too far removed, to be able to hear the expressions to him made by puny creatures amid our sinful and imperfect conditions. Neither is he indifferent and unconcerned. “The eyes of Jehovah are unto the righteous, and his ears unto their cry.” (Ps. 34: 15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Young)</span><span class="font6"> Only the lawless he tunes out: “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright [without any animal sacrifice as a persuasion] is his delight.” (Prov. 15: S) By his powers, which are more wonderful and incomprehensible than radio, he is able to detect and pick up man's unvoiced petition offered within the hidden retreats of the heart or mind. And his powers of response are just as marvelous, to His glory. “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">think,</span><span class="font6"> according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory.”—Eph. 3: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The primary issue of God’s glorious universal domination must be settled here at the earth. Because of this Jehovah God could not be and is not indifferent toward the prayers of worthy creatures on this small planet. Rather than showing unconcern or preoccupation with other matters of seemingly greater importance respecting his unbounded universe, the Most High God of heaven and earth invites true prayer. He watches for it. The time is near when all creatures that gain life everlasting in peace, health and happiness will regularly draw near to him in prayer. That time is the righteous New World which Jehovah God creates. The central government of the New World, the heavenly kingdom of his royal Son. has been established; and the establishment and operations of the “new earth” draw nigh. Hence it is timely that the subject of prayer in its relation to the New World be examined. Prayer to the great Life-giver is vital to all life-seekers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘No religious prayer-book can give us the proper</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">as the first account of praying by men, namely: “Anti to Seth [the son of Adam and Eve], to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord [literally, the name of Jehovah].” That was 235 years after the first man's creation; and, if praying at all, it was religious praying. Actually, it was the beginning of where men called themselves or their selfchosen false gods by the name of the one true God, Jehovah, the Supreme One. It was religious hypocrisy, which brought reproach upon Jehovah’s name because it was a taking of his name in vain, and hence was religious sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>s</sup> More than a hundred years before Enos, his uncle Abel had lived and he offered acceptable sacrifice to Jehovah God. Although no prayer by Abel on that or any other occasion is reported, yet it is certain that in connection with his sacrifice Abel offered prayer to the Lord God, that his offering by fire might be accepted. The favorable answer to his prayer roused hatred and envy of his religious brother Cain, who thereafter slew Abel. But even Abel’s blood, which soaked the ground, cried out to God in a prayer for His vengeance against the religious bloodletter. (Heb. 11:4; 12: 24; Gen. 4: 10,11) Why were Abel’s sacrifice and prayer accepted of Jehovah God? Because such were offered in faith; and “without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him”.—Heb. 11: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">• Faith</span><span class="font6"> means, yes, a belief in the true and living God, but that with an acceptance of His word as true and a hearty reliance upon it. Such confidence is shown by living in harmony with it, waiting for its fulfillment. Abel heard of God’s word, spoken in Eden, which sentenced his father Adam to death, but which also gave promise of a New World, established by God through the Seed taken from the womb or body of his holy universal organization. That Seed was to be hated by the great Seducer because the Seed would refuse to compromise God’s cause. He was to be bruised at “his heel” for that reason. But, let the hatred and painful treatment be what it might, the Seed of God’s organization was promised to overcome the seductive Serpent or Deceiver and to destroy him from the universe. This would insure a new, righteous and peaceable world. (Gen. 3: 14,15,17-19) Abel testified in belief of that divine word, and offered sacrifice and prayer accordingly. His prayer was unselfish, being for vindication of God’s word as true. For his faith and faithful conduct God accounted him righteous even though</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">6 Concerning what did Abel exercise faith in God. and what does his case show as the least or minimum requirements for prayer by men to be acceptable?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">descended from condemned Adam. Meeting such requirements Abel could address God and find acceptance. Less could not be required of men today who want to pray without feeling it foolish but having certainty of being heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Abel is promised a “better resurrection”. He will be back on earth in the New World to which he looked ahead by faith. He will be one of the “princes in all the earth” then, as one of the representatives of the invisible Government of God's King, Christ Jesus, whose sacrifice Abel’s slain lamb foreshadowed. (Heb. 11:35,39,40; Ps. 45: 16) Other faithful men of old who will be associate princes with Abel were likewise praying men. Their prayers were heard of God and answered for reasons like his. The patriarch Abraham prayed, and he was called the “father of all them that believe”. (Rom. 4:11) He was given the specific promise that God would make His name great by vindicating it against all that cursed the name of Jehovah. He would bless all the families of the earth that blessed His holy name. Abraham might be a party to this covenant by coming out from this world and living differently and doing so in hope of the promised world to come. Thenceforth Abraham’s sacrifices and prayers were all in harmony with that divine word of promise. Prayers of religionists are all for the sake of things of this world and its governments; they are not in the interest of the righteous New World and its Theocratic Government. (Gen. 12: 1-3; 14: 22, 23; 15: 2-8; 20:7,17) The true Seed of Abraham, Christ Jesus, the King of the New World, said to the patriarch's natural descendants: “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.” —John 8: 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• Abraham’s natural heirs of the covenant-promise followed his example as to communion with the covenant-keeping God. Isaac prayed for his barren wife that a son might be provided to whom the birthright promise might be handed down. His blessing upon Jacob, when passing onward to this son the promise of covenant blessings, was in itself a prayer to God. (Gen. 25:21; 27:27-29) After the dream of the ladder traveled by angels between heaven and earth Jacob’s vow to God was a form of petition to Him. Jacob’s wrestling all night with an angel and requesting a blessing before meeting his twinbrother Esau was also a strong supplication to the Lord and was in keeping with the hope of the New World.—Gen. 28:16-22; 32:24-30.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">God would bring forth through him. Then God added thereto another covenant, based on his law’ given through the prophet Moses. This covenant was to continue in effect until the promised Seed, Christ Jesus, should come. (Gal. 3:16,17,19,24) In the terms of such law covenant very little, indeed, is said concerning prayer. There is the blessing which was to be pronounced upon the whole covenant nation of God, as stated at Numbers 6: 22-27: “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron [the high priest] and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.” The nation of Israel foretold and prefigured the new nation of spiritual Israel, the apostle’s blessing upon whom corresponds with that of Israel’s high priest, namely: “And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.”—Gal. 6:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> The law covenant through Moses also gave the outline of prayer to be made in recognition of God’s goodness every third year at the time an Israelite brought the tithes of his increase before the altar of the Lord at the temple. This included a confession of faithful obedience to God and closed with the petition: “Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.” —Deut. 26:1-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The mediator of the law covenant with Israel, Moses, was an outstanding man of prayer w’ith God. During the forty-year journey through the wilderness, when God signaled for the camp to move, Moses always acknowledged Him before and after the move. “And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. And when it rested, he said, Return, 0 Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.” (Num. 10:35,36) When the ten plagues were visited upon Egypt Moses several times entreated God at the request of Pharaoh for the lifting of the plagues. (Ex. 8:9, 28-30; 9: 27-33; 10: 17,18) At Mount Sinai, when the Israelites sinned against the Lord by the worship of a golden calf, Moses acted as intercessor. He besought the Lord to spare the people upon whom His name was called, and that for His name’s sake. (Ex. 32: 11-14, 30-34) Later the murmuring of the Israelites against Jehovah at the false, discouraging report</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Qf ten of the spies back from the Promised Land also required the intervention of Moses. (Num. 14:13-19) The Ninetieth Psalm bears the title: “A prayer of Moses, the man of God”; and the next psalm is understood to be Moses’ composition too. It closes with this promise from God to his chosen people: “He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.” (Ps. 91:15,16) Moses was inspired to declare himself a type or prophetic figure of a greater prophet and mediator to come, namely, Christ Jesus. This One also proved to be a mighty intercessor and man of prayer.—Deut. 18:15-19; Acts 3:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGS AND PROPHETS AS EXAMPLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The psalms composed by the shepherd-king David show where he belongs in the study of this subject; and David was a type of the Good Shepherd, the King of kings, Christ Jesus. Psalm 72 ends with the words: “The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.” The prophet Samuel, who anointed the shepherd-boy David to be Israel’s future king, said to the Israelites when they had asked and been given a human king: “Moreover, as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way.” Samuel prayed for the nation because they were God’s covenant people and his visible Theocratic organization upon whom the name of Jehovah was called. “For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.”—1 Sam. 12: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1S</sup> David’s public prayer shortly before his death, when turning over the kingdom and the temple preparations to his son Solomon, glorifies the true Theocracy and universal domination of God. Concerning this it is written: “Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all. the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.”—1 Chron. 29:10-13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14 At the dedication of the temple what did Solomon offer up to God, and how did it close?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Solomon publicly offered up praise and thanksgiving to God, and a fervent petition for the blessing and protection of His chosen nation and for prosperity on the worship of Jehovah at the place where he had put his name. He added: “And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require; that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.” (1 Ki. 8:14-60, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> Among the successors of Solomon to the throne who also offered supplication and praise to the Most High the Record includes kings Jehoshaphat. Asa, Hezekiah and Josiah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> The royal rulers of the nation were not alone in exercising this privilege toward God; those of the people thereof did also. In his discussion of the subject the apostle James writes: “Confess your faults one to another [not to a priest in a confessional box], and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are. and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.” (Jas. 5:16-18; 1 Ki. 17: 1; 18:42-44) During the drought Elijah’s part in raising a widow's son to life was accomplished with supplication to Jehovah.—1 Ki. 17: 19-24.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">*• Elijah’s successor was also much given to calling upon the Lord. His cry at the edge of the Jordan after he had smitten its waters, “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” was answered by Elijah’s God with the dividing of the river waters to permit Elisha's passage. When he was used of Almighty God to raise the Shunammite’s son from the dead, “he went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the Lord.” The miracle followed. At Dothan, when his young servant cried out in terror at the enemy host surrounding them and threatening their destruction, “Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.” Again the prophet prayed, and the Syrian hosts were smitten with open-eyed blindness, as Elisha led them into the camp of the Israelites. (2 Ki. 2:14; 4: 33-35; 6:17-20) Elisha and his predecessor Elijah were both used of God to foreshadow</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1G la) What instances are there showing Elisha was a man of prayer<sup>9 </sup>(b) What were Elijah and Elisha used to foreshadow, and what did their recourse to prayer indicate concerning this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s “strange work” through his faithful witnesses in these modern times before he brings in the New World in completeness. The communication of those ancient men with the God of heaven shows that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in these days cannot be effected by them without likewise calling upon God for help, protection and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>lT</sup> Other men of Israel who figure prominently in the panorama of prayer are Job, Jonah, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel. Job, a contemporary of the prophet Moses, was an example of patient endurance with integrity toward God. He drew near to Jehovah both in prosperity and in affliction, and after his restoration. He is a pictorial representation of all humans who maintain their integrity during this time when wickedness is permitted and who are thereby accounted worthy of life in the New World. Job was instructed to act as intercessor for self-styled friends who had wronged him grievously; and the Record tells us: “And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.”—Job 1: 5, 20,21; 42:8,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jonah had the unique experience of lifting his heart and voice to Almighty God from the belly of a sea-monster. From that living submarine he was heard; and concerning this the account says: “Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish’s belly, and said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font6"> out of the belly of the grave] cried I, and thou heardest my voice.” In being delivered from that tomblike condition Jonah primarily pictured Christ Jesus, who was raised from the dead on the third day to be the King of the New World. In praying down in the depths of the sea he also pictured the remnant of the members of the body of Christ’s followers. These were apparently the “children of death” in 1918, but were brought forth from their sepulchral condition of Christian inactivity in 1919. (Jonah 2:1,2; Ezek. 37:1-14) Thereafter such remnant, like Jonah, applied themselves to the work of preaching God’s message to the nations threatened with destruction at the battle of Armageddon by the “strange act” of God. (Jonah 3:1-10) Those Ninevites who repented at Jonah's preaching escaped destruction which came upon Nineveh in due time. Persons now repenting at the message of Jehovah’s witnesses will be spared by Jehovah’s executioners at Armageddon to find everlasting life in the New World.</span></p>

(Jer. 32:16; 7:16; 14:11; 42:4) For forty years Jeremiah declared the day of God’s vengeance against hypocritical religionists and their temple and city, for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. In this Jeremiah pictured the Lord’s witnesses now engaged in his “strange work” which warns of his “strange act” of destruction upon religious “Christendom” in the tribulation of Armageddon. The prophet Habakkuk foretold of like destruction upon the hypocritical religious organization. His thrilling description, in chapter three, of God’s “strange act” at the final end of the world is headed or introduced by the words: “A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font6"> or, according to variable songs; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font6">in the manner of an ode].” (Hab. 3:1) His exclamation at the vision indeed constitutes a prayer that Jehovah’s faithful remnant and their companions now pray, that Jehovah may avenge and vindicate his name upon his enemies before bringing in the New World in its fullness. The prophets Hosea and Joel exhorted God’s people caught in the snare of religion to turn to him with supplications for his mercies and for help to walk thereafter according to His covenant.—Hos. 14:1, 2; Joel 2: 15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> Ezra, the scribe and priest, was one who joined the remnant of Jews that had left their exile in Babylon and returned to the Holy Land to rebuild the temple on Zion's hill. Rather than require a military escort from the ruler of Babylon, Ezra reports, “so we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us.” They safely reached the temple site without incident. Among the restored remnant of Jehovah’s people Ezra found conditions that deserved to be laid before the Lord God. The Record reads: “Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men, and women, and children: for the people wept very sore.” Then the troublesome matter was straightened out in harmonv with God’s law. —Ezra 8:22, 23; 10:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Nehemiah was another one concerned about the condition of the remnant that had quit Babylon to go up to worship and serve Jehovah in the land which he had given them. Very much depressed at the news brought to him, Nehemiah says: “And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.” Repeatedly he asked the Lord to be attentive to his prayer that he</span></p></li></ul>

His prayer was answered, and he was used for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. While engaged in that work, with enemies all round about threatening violence, Nehemiah says, “nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.” In surprising time the city walls were raised up between the Jews and the enemies. —Neh. 1:4,6,11; 4:9; 6:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The great test that led to Daniel’s being cast into the lions’ den for his faithfulness came because he was a man who could not be restrained from prayer to God. His enemies had the decree framed limiting all prayer for thirty days to King Darius of Medo-Persia. Then Daniel knowingly “went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime”. Daniel’s course of open and known communion with God despite heathen decrees was approved by the great Judge of all in that He rescued Daniel from the lions’ fangs. (Dan. 6:10,21-27) Supplication to God also brought to Daniel the recovery and interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s lost dream of the terrible metallic image. (Dan. 2:16-19) Prayer also preceded the revelation to Daniel of the seventy weeks of years leading up to Messiah the Prince’s appearance on earth (Dan. 9:3,4,20-27); also the marvelous prophecy as to the hostilities of “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” at the “time of the end”, and the standing up of the mighty Prince of God’s people to bring in the New World.—Dan. 10:2,3,12; 11:1-45; 12:1-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> After the flight of several centuries from Malachi, the last of the old Hebrew prophets, there appeared another prophet, who was a miniature fulfillment of Malachi’s propheev concerning Elijah. (Mal. 4:5,6; Matt. 11:13,14; 17:10-13) This favored prophet was John the Baptist, the forerunner of the true Seed of Abraham upon whom all blessings for all families of the earth rest. John's father -was a man of faith and prayer. That is sure from the Record: “According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> John grew up in the deserts till his testimony concerning Jehovah’s purpose and the coming of the Messiah was due to begin. Disciples or learners gathered about John at his preaching. He baptized the repentant ones in water. Among other things, he showed them their relationship to God and instructed them as to approaching and addressing Him. Hence Jesus’ followers asked the Master for like instruction; as recorded: “And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” (Luke 11:1) Others “said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, . . . but thine eat and drink!” (Luke 5:33) Jesus then explained why they did not fast.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” All the above-noted men lived and died before Jesus’ death and resurrection and ascension to heaven. Upon what basis, then, could those men draw nigh to God in prayer and find a hearing ear and answer from Him! The religious belief is that any and all men anywhere and at any time may offer a prayer and, if it is sincere and earnest, it will find its way to God and be accepted of him. The Bible reply does not support that. The men whose prayers were accepted of old time were men of faith in the true and living God, Jehovah. Because they believed in his existence and supremacy, they also believed and depended upon his word. Hence they avoided religion and its worship of demon gods and its acceptance of man’s word, particularly the word of religious clergymen. They believed God’s word as it was added to by His further revelations from time to time. Always it pointed to the coming of his Seed, the Deliverer, and the creating of a new world. So they did not fall in with the schemes and policies of men regarding this old world under demon rule. In hope of the new world they walked according to God’s word and devoted themselves to pleasing him. Their faith and devotion to God and his purpose brought them a measure of righteousness or justification, which then made them acceptable with God. Such justification was a picture of the true justification that should come to Christ’s faithful followers.—Rom. 4:22-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>,e</sup> From Moses’ time forward till Christ those whose prayers God recognized were faithful members of his chosen people of Israel. They were in relationship with the Most High God by the covenant of his law given through Moses the mediator. Thus</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">24 Who gathered about John the Baptist* and what proof la there that he taught them to pray?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 Upon vs hat basis could the men of old before Moses draw near to God in prayer and get a bearing and answer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">26 From Mottes onward what further basis for offering acceptable prayer was there, and bow only could “strangers&quot; approach God in prayer and receive answer ? </span><span class="font6">they were persons in covenant bonds with God and who were endeavoring to be faithful to the covenant by loving obedience. Any who were aliens and strangers to the nation of Israel and outside its covenant must approach God through his organized people and in the manner of worship he had ordained in connection with his temple. Only thus could strangers, such as Rahab, the Gibeonites, Jael, Ruth, the Nethinim, the widow of Zarephath, Naaman the Syrian, Ebed-melech, and others, find any favor from God and any answer to prayer. To this effect King Solomon said, when dedicating the temple: “Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.” (2 Chron. 6: 32, 33) Such provision for the “stranger&quot; should be of great encouragement and consolation to those who feel far off from Jehovah and unacquainted with Him, and who now are inclined to “seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him”.—Acts 17: 27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MASTER TEACHER ON THE QUESTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The argument may be raised, that the aboverelated cases of communication between God and man were before the coming of Christ Jesus and that since his coming the conditions respecting prayer have been radically changed and all formality has been cast out. Those arguing so depend heavily on Jesus’ condemnation of the procedure of the Jewish religionists of his day. They quote his words: “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">27 Since Christ, wbat radical argument may be made by some concerning prayer, and upon what words of Jesus do they base tbelr argument? </span><span class="font6">in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” (Matt. 6: 5-13; Luke 11:1-4) “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater [condemnation].” —Matt. 23:14; Mark 12:40; Luke 20:47; 18:9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Are Jesus’ words to be understood as holding down all prayer by his followers to private prayer unobserved by all others, even by fellow Christians? Do his words cut out all public prayer amid an audience? Is there to be no regularity about prayer in the endeavor to avoid repetitions? Do Jesus’ words condemn Daniel for three times daily offering petition to God where he could be observed by his enemies and hence be turned over by them to the lions? Where should prayer be presented, and how? These and many other questions can be answered satisfactorily by looking at the Record which has the approbation and imprimatur of Jehovah God and his High Priest, Christ Jesus. That very Record closes with prayers written so they can be read by all: “Even so, come, Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”—Rev. 22:20, 21.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> To the Samaritan woman at the well near Mount Gerizim Jesus said: “Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” (John 4:21,23,24) The hour has come where worship of Jehovah God, including prayer, is not restricted to any city or building. It is no longer needful, as in Daniel’s case, to pray with one's windows open and face turned toward the site of ancient Jerusalem. It is not necessary, as in the case of worshipers in the temple at Jerusalem, to pray with the face westward toward the Holy of Holies. Since the “Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands”, one’s posture or the direction of petition and thanksgiving need not be toward any earthly site. One’s attention and offering should be to the God of heaven and earth. “For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same [from east to west] my name shall be great among the Gentiles [the nations]; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in every place </span><span class="font6">incense [accompanying prayer] shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">28 . What questions, therefore, arise concerning prayer? and why may the Bible record be expected to give satisfactory answers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">29 . What did Jesus say to the Samaritan woman at the well respecting worship, and what does this indicate as to posture, direction or place in offering prayer? </span><span class="font6">be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.” —Mal. 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> At the very beginning of his earthly ministry as Jehovah’s “faithful and true witness” Jesus is observed at prayer, in the presence of John the Baptist. “Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the holy [spirit] descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.” (Luke 3: 21, 22) That voice was a response to Jesus’ petition. The apostle Paul’s words, at Hebrews 10: 5-10, indicate that, while thus praying, Jesus had in mind Psalm 40:6-8: “Sacrifice and offering [of animals] thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” This was an expression of Jesus’ consecration of himself to his God and Father, Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> The Father’s voice from heaven and the sending down of his spirit or active force on Jesus was open proof of his acceptance of Jesus’ consecration and the offering of himself. Jesus’ attitude at his water baptism was prayerful. This shows his followers that the occasion of being immersed in water is a time of serious consideration, one of looking to God and asking for help to carry out what is symbolized by such baptism, namely, one’s consecration to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; Jesus prayed to the Most High God, His Father Jehovah. He did not pray to himself, which he would have been doing if he were a member of a religious “trinity of three persons in one God”. Jesus was on earth. His God and Father was in heaven. Regularly during his earthly witness to God’s kingdom Jesus offered supplication’ and thanksgiving to God. If Jesus were God Almighty Most High himself, then it was foolish for Jesus thus to pray; for he would be praying to himself and would be hypocritical, deceiving any who heard and observed him at prayer on numerous occasions. It was fitting, however, for him to offer up petition to God, for he is Jehovah’s Son: “who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; called of God an high priest after the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">31. What do the Father’s voice and the descent of the spirit therefore prove? and what should be the attitude of Jesus' followers at time of water baptism?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">32. What foolish deductions respecting prayer does the “trinity&quot; doctiine lead to, and why was it fitting for Jesus to pray to God? </span><span class="font6">order of Melchisedec,” (Heb. 5:7-10) The priest-king of old, Melchizedek, publicly prayed Jehovah’s blessing upon Abraham.—Gen. 14:18-20; Heb. 7:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“ In the sermon on the mount Jesus’ words concerning prayer in secret did not mean that thenceforth Jesus did not go up as a Jew the three required times each year to the temple at Jerusalem and join in the public prayers that were there offered by all the congregation at the time of offering the incense. (Luke 1: 9,10; Rev. 5:8; 8: 3, 4) Jesus’ presence at such feasts in Jerusalem is repeatedly reported. As a Jew according to the flesh he was “made of a woman, made under the law”, and said he: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.” Accordingly he continued celebrating the feast of the passover until the paschal sacrifice was fulfilled in himself and he became “Christ our passover”. (Gal. 4:4; Matt. 5:17; 1 Cor. 5:7) So it was that Jesus is reported at his last typical passover feast and as offering up in the hearing of those come to the feast this request: “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say! Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name.” “Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.” (John 12: 20-30) Jesus did not violate his own instructions concerning secret prayer; for his Father answered his public prayer with public response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Jesus was anointed with God’s spirit to be the King of the Government of the New World, and all his petitions to his Father were in behalf of that world to come. In Jesus particularly the primaryissue of Jehovah’s universal domination was at stake. How so? Because Jesus is Chief Executive in the Government through which God has chosen to exercise his universal sovereignty and through which also he will for ever vindicate his blasphemed name. Satan the Devil and would-be usurper of the universal domination tried to destroy the Government at its very root by striving to make Jesus fail of worthiness of the kingship. He used all his devilish arts and means to make Jesus come to terms with him and break his faultless integrity toward the Most High God. But Jesus was uncompromising toward God’s adversary. He proved that Jehovah’s chief Son and highest officer in His universe was unbreakably loyal and faithful and true to Him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">33. After Jesus’ words concerning prayer in secret, what about bis own joining in public prayer at the temple or offering up personal prayer there’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">34 (a) How was the primary issue particularly at stake In Jesus, and whj would this fact specially require prayer on his part? (b) Why, then, is it appropriate for his followers to pray?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">To keep his grip on his integrity toward Jehovah, Jesus drew on the divine strength by supplication to Him. This enabled him to vindicate his Father’s name and word by unswerving obedience and a correctness of course on earth. So he proved worthy to exercise the powers of the New World government and vindicate Jehovah’s name at the battle of Armageddon. For related reasons, namely, to keep integrity and share with Jesus in vindicating God's name, his faithful followers need likewise to resort to prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’’Jesus must have been praying behind no shut door of a secret closet but in the hearing of others, when that recorded at Luke 11:1, 2 occurred: “And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.” Jesus did not brush the subject of prayer aside as from henceforth an indifferent matter, governed by suddenly arising emergencies and not having directive objectives. He showed that divinely guided prayer concerns itself with the New World and its Government which will cause God’s name to be hallowed in all creation. He did not teach that prayer be offered to his human mother or to any saints after death, to act as intercessors. It should be offered up to the Creator of the New World. Address to Jehovah, not alone as God but in the new relation of “Our Father&quot;, was by no means indicating that the so-called “Fatherhood of God” toward all men was now established and that all men on earth, as creatures, could approach God and address him as “Our Father”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Universal &quot;Fatherhood of God” doctrine does not fit in with Jesus’ words to the religionists: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will- do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie. he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8: 44) Fatherhood of God did not apply to Cain, the brother of Abel: “Not as Cain, who was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of that ivicked one,</span><span class="font6"> and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him! Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.”—1 John 3: 12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">35 Where was Jesus* praying when he was afterward asked to teach his disciples to pray, and what did be then show as to divinely guided prayer’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">36 When introducing the form of address “Our Father&quot;, win could not Jesus have been teaching the &quot;Fatheibood of God&quot; toward ail men’ 37. By the address “Our Father&quot; what was Jesus reallj show ins and why could he properly teach bis disciples to pray thus to God’ </span><span class="font6">are sons of God and may address him in petition as “Our Father”. Contrariwise, this very form of approach as introduced by Jesus shows who only may draw near to God and make known their requests to him. The disciples whom Jesus thus taught were, first of all, members of the Jewish nation which was in the law covenant with God, and hence were His people. Also these men had left all to follow the Son of God. Thus, besides what they were naturally as Jews by birth, they were wholly consecrated to God as Jesus was. They were men of faith in Jehovah God like their forefathers Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They believed in God’s Word, and especially his promises concerning the coming Messiah or Christ, the Seed of Abraham. In expression of that belief they followed Jesus. He knew that God’s spirit was to be poured out upon all consecrated flesh of this kind and that these would be begotten of God’s spirit to become his spiritual children, spiritual Israelites, the children of the One whom Abraham typified, Jehovah. As such prospective children of God Jesus taught </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">them </span><span class="font6">to express themselves to God as “Our Father”. The other Jews that did not believe on him could not use this prayer. Therefore it is written: “He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”—J ohn 1:11-13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” Such spirit-begotten sons of God, being anointed of Him and proving faithful to death, are all to be associated with Christ Jesus in the Government of the New World. Rightly their prayer would be looking toward that coming world and in the interest of God’s kingdom. The apostle Peter wrote to such, saying: “Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.” (2 Pet. 3:13,14) Such sons make up the “Israel of God”, not after the flesh but after the spirit, and hence His “holy nation”. (1 Pet. 2:9) Prior to Christ “Israel after the flesh” was the only nation having access to God during the time of their favor with him. Thereafter the “holy nation” of spiritual Israel was the only body of people privileged to pray to Jehovah God as “Our Father” and with answers in view. This exclusive privilege of these spiritual sons of God continued down to the setting up of the heavenly Government of the New World in A.D. 1914 and the coming of its King to</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">38 . Toward what would the prayers of his disciples be looking, and till when has their privilege of prayer to God been exclusive? </span><span class="font6">the temple thereafter in 1918. Since then God’s favor has been going out to those who were foreshadowed by the “strangers” that lined themselves up with God’s chosen people of old. Clearing up of the privileges of these present-day companions of the remnant of God’s “holy nation” will be made later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> In addition to his words in the sermon on the mount Jesus gave some final instructions concerning prayer to his disciples on the night of his betrayal and arrest. He said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. ... I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. . . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” —John 14: 6,12-14; 15: 7,16; 16: 23, 24.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">*° After his conversation which included the above words Jesus then, in the presence of the eleven faithful disciples, “lifted up his eyes to heaven.” He prayed for them, and for all those who would believe on Jehovah God and Christ Jesus through their testimony or witness. Then he led them out to the garden of Gethsemane, where he prayed apart from them and received strength to endure the supreme test just ahead.—John 17:1-26; 18:1; Matt. 26:36-46.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> The sum of the above is this: Henceforth no creature on earth could go to God with petition and have His recognition and answer unless he came by way of Christ Jesus and offered his requests in the name of the Son of God. Jesus’ faithful course of integrity toward God even unto death proved him worthy of a resurrection to life in the spirit and a return to his Father in heaven; and thereby Christ Jesus was opening up a way for believing humankind to come to God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> By his ransom sacrifice Jesus takes away the sin of such believers, and by this they are made acceptable to God as his children. Of old Moses was mediator between Jehovah and Israel. Now Christ Jesus, whom Moses foretold and prefigured, is the “one mediator between God and men” of spiritual</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">40. Thereafter on that same night what prayer did he himself offer? 41. What do Jesus* above instructions show as to offering prayer henceforth, and how did he himself open up the way for it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">42. Why thenceforth must all prayer be offered up in Jesus’ name? </span><span class="font6">Israel. Hence approach to the great Hearer of prayer may be, not direct, but only through his Son. All prayer must be offered up in his name. (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6) God does not deny himself, neither does his Son deny him; and hence the above rules regarding prayer may not be by-passed and ignored. To try to do so would be presumptuous and would meet with no success.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The subject is a large one, because it is important. We are at the portals of the New World. Men of good-will desire and expect to enter into life everlasting in that world without end. They are asking about the privilege and the proprieties of prayer. A related article in the next succeeding issue of this magazine will answer such questions.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark14"></a>FREEDOM OF WORSHIP</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font5">REEDOM of worship comes from Jehovah God, the Giver oi life. It is granted and secured only to those unselfishly devoted to Almighty God. This fundamental freedom was guaranteed by Jehovah long before worldly governments of man were established. It began with the history of man and has accompanied the faithful down through the old world. It is the foundation freedom of the New World. This freedom was claimed by the apostles Peter and John before the ancient Sanhedrin court, where they declared: “We ought to obey God rather than men.’’ (Acts 5:29) Jehovah guaranteed to them freedom to preach, for it is written: “They ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.”—Acts 5:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although worldly governments must recognize this right, they can no more grant to Jehovah’s witnesses the liberty to worship God than they can give to God the liberty of receiving such worship The immortal freedom to preach as a minister of Almighty God soars high above the reach of earthly powers or decrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, in all the earth, there is but one people who enjoy freedom of worship. It cannot be taken from them. Who are these people? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's witnesses!</span><span class="font5"> All others are forced, through blindness, ignorance, or fear, to serve Satan the Devil in spite of the constitutional compacts of freedom in liberal democratic nations. This unbreakable guarantee has been held by Jehovah’s servants only by a fight on many fronts throughout the woild. Such battles today are like those of the Israelites in ancient times to protect that granted them by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The acts-of the apostles and the words of Jesus describe our fight today against our enemies as not against flesh and blood, but against the Devil and his demon spirit creatures, deceiving and directing visible rulers of this evil world. (Eph 6:12) Therefore the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. (2 Cor. 10:4) Our weapons are: the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness. and the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God.—-Eph. 6:13-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful course of the apostles proves that they were the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font5"> to claim in court their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">supreme, God-given and legally guaranteed</span><span class="font5"> right to worship God as commanded by Him. This was centuries before the writing of the Magna Charta or the Bill of Rights. This claim they made to keep open the field of worship established by Almighty God. The “recognized” religious clergy opposed their preaching and goaded the officials to persecute the apostles —“unrecognized” ministers. Today the religious priests, rabbis and preachers put pressure upon the officials and rabble elements of the nations and engineer the persecution of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and cause their ministerial status to be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1933 the Jesuits, through Hitler—the “housepainter”—stole the German government. He made his first payment to the fellow conspirators, the Catholic Hierarchy, by banning Jehovah’s witnesses, confiscating their property and literature, and placing in concentration camps all such faithful ministers as he had not killed In 1933 there began in the United States the invasion of the field of worship by wholesale arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey, under the rule of Catholic-IIague gangsters, which other states followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1935 the flag-salute persecution in the United States overran every state in the Union, accompanied by suffering and destruction. Along with and following these moves came a widespread increase of arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching the gospel, throughout every state of the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1939 war machines thundered out of Germany Hitler struck through Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and overran continental Europe, and Italy betrayed and stabbed prostrate France in the back. Then the Nazi-Fascist-Catholic Hierarchy-American Legion combine in the United States launched a campaign of violence against defenseless and helpless Jehovah’s witnesses about June 3, 1940, the day the United States Supreme Court handed down its notorious judgment against liberty in the flag case Along with this came nation-wide destruction, death, mobs, and assaults against Jehovah’s witnesses, their children and their property in almost every state in the country This continued without abatement for more than two years. The states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky took the lead in this invasion of the field of freedom by violence. The false arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses increased throughout the nation and mounted up to several thousands annually Many cases were carried through to high courts to secure the risht of Jehovah’s witnesses under the Bill of Rights to preach the gospel. On June 8, 1942, the United States Supreme Court struck what was thought to be the final, death blow against Jehovah’s witnesses by approving the notorious license-tax laws against their charitable preaching activity. Then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The floods of illegal arrests and avalanches of violence during the years 1940 to 1942 did not deter Jehovah’s faithful fighting witnesses. They pushed straight ahead against demonized encroachments and continued preaching the gospel, paying the cost of their warfare in casualties, loss of liberty, beatings, scourgings, and other violence, from border to border and from coast to coast, to say nothing of being tossed, nation-wide, into the fiery furnace of unfavorable newspaper publicity. Condemned to rot in judicial shackles and fetters and made fit to die in the eyes of the public, Jehovah’s witnesses, nevertheless, stood firm, courageous, and immovable in keeping their preaching covenant to Jehovah God against these dark, fierce storm clouds of destruction. Greatly outnumbered, with demon hosts driving the municipalities on to assault God’s people throughout the nation, Jehovah’s witnesses stood firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When these invasions of the field of worship reached their height, Jehovah assembled his people throughout the world, in September, 1942. This was the first New World Theocratic Assembly. There it was revealed that the ancient leadership by Jephthah of God’s chosen people to victory pictures the present-day </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic rule</span><span class="font5"> over God’s organization and the blessings it has brought and will continue to bring with victory until the final war for freedom at Armageddon. Almighty God made known to His people that Christ Jesus is in charge of the battle. The promised and anticipated fulfillment of the Jephthah picture of victory gave the Lord’s people great joy. The benefits received at that assembly can be likened unto the comforting message of Jehovah to Jehoshaphat: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. ... set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> with you . . . : fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> will be with you [to deliver you].”—2 Chron. 20:15, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, trusting not in the arm of flesh, not in any man or man-made compact, and not fearing the disapproval of the highest court of the nation, pushed on in their preaching activity in every city and in every state. They, as an organized Christian army, welded together unbreakably in love and faith, were willing to pay the price of casualties, court cases, appeals, persecutions, loss of liberty, property, and position, and other indignities, for the opportunity of proving integrity to Almighty God. What was the answer of Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On September 3, 1942, Jehovah's witnesses filed their motion for reconsideration of the license-tax decision and shortly thereafter an appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court to review the flag decision of 1940. On May 3, 1943, the license-tax invasions were swept out of the land by a vote of 5 justices to 4. On June 14, 1943, the compulsory flag-salute regulations were declared to be un-.Vmerican, by a vote of 6 to 3, and the battle of Jehovah’s witnesses in that court was completely vindicated. On the same day the high court held invalid, by a vote of 9 to nothing, the Mississippi statute declaring Jehovah’s witnesses’ activity to be subversive. The State of Mississippi had permitted religious seditionists freedom but had persecuted Christians. The faithful brethren in Mississippi who did not retreat from such Goliath-like opposition were rewarded. The Great Warrior, Christ Jesus, thus swept out of the field of freedom of worship these encroachments that mounted high after many years of invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The battle was not won solely by the faithful and bold fight waged in the courts. The victory was given by Jehovah mainly because of the continued preaching activity of his publishers on the home front, who kept the command of Jehovah, to wit: “Tomorrow go ye down against them.” “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her [organized religion] in battle.” (2 Chron. 20:16; Obadiah 1) The Lord blessed their efforts and brought about the victory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these latest decisions of the United States Supreme Court, it took a long step toward restoring itself to the high position of confidence as custodian of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which for many years it enjoyed in the minds of all lovers of liberty,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah's witnesses have trusted in </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the Supreme Judge of the Supreme Court of the Universe</span><span class="font5"> to interpret His irrevocable, unimpeachable and unbreakable guarantee of freedom of worship and freedom to be active in preaching Before Jehovah, the Supreme Judge, Christ Jesus, the Mighty Advocate and the Wonderful Counsellor, has obtained judgment against the nations to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">enforce</span><span class="font5"> this decree of freedom by his “rod of iron”. He rules over His people in the midst of many enemies and strikes through kings to establish freedom of worship for them in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have run to and fro throughout the lands, and “climbed over the ‘legal’ walls” thrown up by the religionists, to reach the prisoners in the religious prison houses and liberate them from religion and fear (Joel 2:7-9; Isa. 61: 1,2) The Lord has caused these protective walls—ordinances and statutes—to fall flat, level with the ground, thus leaving the religious “vipers” (snakes in the grass) unprotected from His burning and searching truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spectacular battles and victories of old did not end the fight of the Israelites to take the Promised Land. We cannot expect the enemy in this modern warfare to desist from attacking God’s people. The fight continues to the very end. New mischief will be framed by law, requiring continued resistance. The persecutions of Christ Jesus never slackened. Jesus said: “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”—John 15:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s faithful ministers will ever be faced with worldly officers, boards, commissions and others who do not recognize their status as ministers and their rights as ambassadors of the New-World. The increased preaching throughout the world will bring increased persecution. The “new order” will have a guarantee of “freedom of religion” but none for freedom to worship Almighty God. The “new order” does not bring peace. There can be no peace between Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and the Devil’s organization. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to fight to establish freedom and push the battle to and through the gates of every nation under the sun. They will do this until freedom to worship Almighty God has been established through Christ Jesus in every foot of territory assigned His faithful followers in the earth. Let the enemy take notice now: We </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will not retreat or surrender one foot of it! </span><span class="font5">It may be that the Lord will restore to His people their rights in Germany and in other totalitarian lands where the work is now banned. The fight is long and hard—an endurance test. The more difficult and hard the fight, the more glorious the triumph through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each publisher, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is an ordained minister. He will not stay at home, seek a path of ease, or go on a “sit-down strike”, but will actively use his freedom by preaching from house to house. The battle will be waged on the “home front” of each publishers assignment. He will continue to stay in his own territory, will not flee from opposition, but boldly face the enemy, relying on Jehovah for deliverance. The faithful servant will recognize that his battle is not with flesh and blood, but with the demons, and will keep on the whole armor of God, day and night, in order to stand in the evil day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1939 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font5"> was provided to aid the brethren in court battles. Those who studied it prudently were not caught unawares when arrested, and they gave a good account of themselves before the courts. It has helped the brethren to fight the enemy, to frame the issues before the lower courts, to lay the groundwork for appeals to higher courts of the states and to the United States Supreme Court, and to act as their own counsel before the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To maintain his strong position, the minister of God must study. “Study to shew thyself approved unto God.” Such minister will be ever ready with an answer concerning the hope that is within him, to people of good-will and the enemy. He will not spurn the Lord's provided spiritual food. He will prepare himself aforetime to meet opposition from the enemy, and not wait until arrested to begin to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those witnesses remaining on the “home front” and all those who go into other lands to preach the gospel are faced with great, clear and immediate need of training in methods of court-fighting to protect their rights of worship and in keeping clean all legal avenues of worship Now all such Christian ministers may have the opportunity to be trained in the art of self-defense in the courts at law</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to recent developments, the Society saw the need of newer and better equipment for the faithful warriors to remove encroachments from all fields of worship. A handy instrument, a new booklet, is now provided that helps improve their knowledge of how to effectively use the “sword of the spirit” and the “spirit of a sound mind” in the battle with the enemy, when before police, judges and others. It contains a thorough course in legal training for the Theocratic minister and carefully guides the path of such minister from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font5"> of opposition to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">final end</span><span class="font5"> of the case on appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name of the booklet is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship.</span><span class="font5"> It was released the first day of the “Free Nation's” Theocratic Assembly last August, amid tremendous applause by all those assembled, in 100 cities of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is being studied regularly at service meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. Each Theocratic minister will study it on other occasions until the suggestions contained therein become his own.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark16"></a>AARON, ISRAEL’S FIRST HIGH PRIEST</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font5">ARON played a very important role in the early history of the typical Theocratic nation. Contemporaneous with Moses, Aaron’s course was overshadowed to some extent by the leading role played by his better-known brother, yet believers in God’s Word will not lose sight of Aaron’s activities at the time of Israel's birth as a typical Theocracy, and his duties relative to that nation’s worship of Jehovah, as ordered at Mount Sinai and thereafter. God-fearing Christians today will not ignore this prophetic history concerning the exodus and the wilderness trek, remembering the apostle Paul’s declaration that it was recorded particularly for Christians on earth at the ‘time of the end*. (1 Cor 10:1-11) As high priest Aaron foreshadowed Christ Jesus alone, and at still other times he pictured the anointed remnant on earth during these last days of Satan’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1598 B.C. Aaron was born, to Amram and Jochebed, in the land of Egypt. In course of time he married Elisheba and had four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. The first mention of Aaron appears in the Divine Record at Exodus 4:14-16: “And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.” (A.R.V.) Moses had been called by the Lord to be the deliverer of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, and he had raised the point that he was not “eloquent”, but was “slow of speech”. Aaron was provided as his spokesman</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thereafter Aaron met Moses at the mount of God Moses communicated to his brother all the things Jehovah had instructed as being preliminaries to the exodus from bondage. Together the brothers then journeyed to Egypt, and Aaron, as Moses’ mouthpiece, “spake all the words which the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.” (Ex. 4: 27-31) Next in order were the appearances before the haughty Egyptian Pharaoh. Aaron spoke the judgments of God as instructed by Moses, and at the proper time stretched forth the rod of Moses that signaled the start of several of the plagues Thus in unity of action Aaron and Moses worked Jehovah backed them up. The tenth plague left not one Egyptian household without a death to mourn, and God’s people Israel were hustled from that land of servitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wherein are the foregoing acts of Aaron prophetic ? Moses is a type of a greater Deliverer, Christ Jesus (Acts 3:20-23) In the above sequence of events Aaron symbolizes Jehovah’s witnesses living in these last days of antitypical oppressive “Egypt”, Satan’s world Now, at the time of the end of that world, Jehovah has sent forth His Greater Moses and Deliverer, Christ Jesus, to rule The King at the temple uses the witnesses as his mouthpieces in the earth. Jehovah chose the brother of Moses as his spokesman; in the fulfillment He has selected the spiritual brethren of Christ to speak. Aaron’s use of Moses’ rod, symbol of authority, shows that the witnesses today act under divine command and authority in the gospelpreaching work. Moses directed Aaron to do certain things in connection with the plagues; Jehovah has given Christ all-power to plague Satan’s organization, and he in turn confers authority upon his earthly remnant to perform certain acts in carrying out Jehovah’s “strange work”. He directs their repeated smiting of the enemy organization with the “arrows” of truth, which plagues the enemy considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the third month after their liberation from Egypt the Israelites eamped before Mount Sinai. Aaron, along with a limited few, was permitted to approach with Moses toward the mount of God, and was blessed with a vision of Jehovah’s glory. (Ex. 24: 9,10) Thence Moses went up into the mount, where he remained forty days. He received Theocratic laws from God's hand for the guidance of the typical Theocracy, and in addition was given minute instructions as to the conduct of Theocratic worship. The construction of the tabernacle was detailed and the functions of the priests serving therein were outlined. To Aaron was appointed the position of high priest. According to God’s instructions, he was inducted into that high office by Moses.—Leviticus 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aaron did not arrogate this high position to himself, nor was he democratically voted into it by any religious college of cardinals; no, but “called of God” was he. (Heb. 5:4) For forty years he served in this capacity, representing before the Lord the entire twelve tribes. (Ex. 39: 6-14) At times his authority in the priestly office was questioned by those lacking appreciation of Theocratic rule. Outstanding was the rebellion of Korah, a fellow tribesman, a Levite. The earth itself opened up and swallowed Korah and his eo-conspirators against God’s anointed high priest. Thereafter the congregation complained against Moses and Aaron, and twelve rods representing the twelve tribes were placed in the tabernacle, that the Lord might indicate his choice. Upon the rod of Levi, Aaron's name was written. On the morrow, when the rods were brought forth from the tabernacle, the rod bearing Aaron’s name had budded and blossomed and yielded almonds. Beyond all doubt the tribe of Levi was God’s choice for the tabernacle service, and Aaron was high priest by divine right. The budded rod of Aaron was kept in the ark of the testimony as a token against the rebels —Numbers 16,17 ; Heb 9: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The duties of the high priest are of prophetic significance For example, on the day of atonement the high priest offered as sin-offerings a bullock and a goat, presenting in the most holy of the tabernacle the blood of the animals. Herein Aaron is pictorial of Jehovah’s great High Priest, Christ Jesus, presenting his life right as a human creature in the heavenly courts of Jehovah, as a sin-offering for imperfect men who are devoted to God.—Leviticus 16; Heb. 9:6-12,22-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aaron was not without sin; he made mistakes, some serious ones. During the first forty-day stay of Moses upon Mount Sinai “the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him”. (Ex. 32:1) Aaron acceded to the popular demand and practiced religion. Thereafter, when Moses came down from the mount and cried out, “Whoso is on Jehovah’s side, let him come unto me,” all the sons of Levi, including Aaron, ranged themselves alongside Moses. Similarly, in 1918 Jehovah’s people were tainted by religion in that they looked to worldly rulers as “higher powers”, thus regarding them in the position of gods. Like Aaron, they discerned their mistake, repented, and went forward in Theocratic service. (Isa. 26:13,14) This shows that the Lord’s people must wait upon proper instructions from the King Christ Jesus, and not try to run ahead of the Lord and act on their own responsibility or upon popular demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On another occasion Aaron, along with his sister Miriam, was guilty of trespass. Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses because of his marriage to an Ethiopian woman, and went so far as to challenge the position in which Jehovah had placed Moses, saying, “Hath the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> indeed spoken only by Mosest hath he not spoken also by usl” Jehovah heard this seditious speech against the Theocratic order, and took action suddenly. The three involved were brought before the tabernacle, and Jehovah demanded of Aaron and Miriam how it was that they dared speak against Moses, seeing that He had exalted and used their brother in such a marvelous way. Then Miriam was stricken with leprosy. Aaron quickly acknowledged the foolishness of his sin, pleaded with Moses for Miriam’s sake, and Moses in turn besought the Lord, that she might be healed. Jehovah answered the prayer of his servant.—Numbers 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In their fortieth year of wandering in the wilderness, the Israelites came unto Mount Hor. Aaron had lived for 123 years; soon the Israelites would enter the Promised Land. To Aaron and Moses Jehovah said: “Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: and strip Aaron of his garments [of the high priest’s office], and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.” (Num. 20:23-29) So it was. Aaron died in Mount Hor, and his son Eleazar succeeded him in the office of high priest This office was to go to the firstborn son, upon the death of the high priest. The two older sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, were destroyed by the Lord when they offered strange fire before Him; hence Eleazar was in line for the service privilege of being Israel’s high priest. Aaron was likely buried by his brother and son, and for him Israel mourned thirty days—Num. 20 29, 33-38,39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Aaron” means “lofty”. Jehovah’s High Priest Christ Jesus occupies the most exalted position in the universe, next to Jehovah, being placed at the head of the capital organization Also, the name means “enlightened”. Christ Jesus said: “I am the light of the world”, and the remnant of the royal priesthood have been called out of the darkness of this world and into the marvelous light of The Theocracy. (1 Pet. 2:9) Remember, Aaron could “speak well”. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are instructed and enlightened by Jehovah God and the Greater Moses, and they must be diligent to speak the Lord’s judgments against the modern-day “Egypt&quot;, and offer instruction in the true worship of God to all men of good-will. The priests in Israel were the ones responsible for educating the people in God’s laws and commandments. The people desiring to have Theocratic education looked to them, realizing that Jehovah had ordained the priests for such service. Malachi 2: 7 states: “The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> of hosts.” Now, Jehovah’s witnesses must use their lips to speak the truth and to feed many, carrying on a campaign of free, Theocratic education among men of good-will. (Prov. 10:21) As Aaron acted closely with Moses as his mouthpiece, the witnesses now on the earth must declare the testimony of Jesus Christ that is committed to them. (Rev. 12:17) Their service as “mouthpieces” is assured of success by Jehovah God. (Isa. 59:21) When their ‘speaking’ is completed and the “other sheep” are gathered, then the Almighty God. through Christ, will speak in His wrath to the “goats” that spurned the message his witnesses declared. (Ps. 2:5) Wicked men will understand the language of force and destruction that He will level against them at Armageddon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark18"></a>FIELD EXPERIENCES</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERS IN BRITAIN SAY:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We would just like to say now what a joy the work is these days. We seem to be having such grand experiences these days. The people did not seem to want studies at all the first time that we worked F----, nor the second time,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nor the third, but our determination has at last made them see the importance, and we are running fourteen book studies. One of our people of good-will overheard quite a discussion about us that took place in a bus, as they were waiting for it to start. It appears that my companion and I were riding past with our magazine bags on. One man could not contain himself and started to give the occupants of the bus an idea of what he thought of us: ‘wasting our time, lazy, etc.’ Then up flares a young lady: ‘Don’t you say that about those two girls; they are about the only real Christians round these parts, and my mother has them regularly every week and would never turn them away. They give the people real comfort, and it is a pity they aren’t appreciated more.’ ”—D.E.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A man contacted in the door-to-door work did not want to hear the phonograph, but had a number of questions to ask and seemed satisfied with the answers given. Eventually he heard the phonograph recording, but declared that it was ‘over his head’. He accepted the loan of a book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font5">and would welcome a return visit. I made the return call, taking the recording ’The Dead’, and answered many questions and outlined the study procedure. A study was arranged for Sunday evening, after our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. Exceptional interest was shown by his married daughter, who had read much of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> and rejoiced in it. His wife was also interested, and a book study was carried through with all having a share in looking up the scriptures in the Questions Booklet. Great progress has been made over the past four studies, and now the daughter and her father have attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> studies. The daughter’s first field report of witnessing showed five hours’ work, with placements and a sound attendance, together with some names in her notebook for return calls. This after little more than a month after our first contact with them.”—S.J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN A FEDERAL PRISON CAMP (WASHINGTON)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry</span><span class="font5"> booklet was gotten to the boys, there was much rejoicing over this. They have already selected their committee, and in turn they have chosen one to conduct the meetings with it. These Jehovah’s witnesses are forbidden to attempt to witness to their fellow inmates. After much deliberation they have finally been allowed to have their study meetings, but only those registered in the office as Jehovah’s witnesses are allowed to attend. Any infraction of this ruling meets with punishment. Last week during a windstorm the flag atop a very high flagpole became badly entangled and could not be lowered. Two of the Jehovah’s witnesses endeavored to release the flag. One of the boys finally shinnied up the pole and carefully brought the flag down. Comment of the onlookers was noteworthy. One said: ‘Of all the hundreds of men here, wouldn’t it beat all to see one of those Jehovah’s rescue our flag!’ Another blandly remarked: ‘You see, they’d risk their lives to save that flag, but you couldn't force them to salute it.’ Recently pressure was brought to bear against them, being fomented and augmented by the prison chaplain. Every bit of literature they had, including their Bibles, was taken from them. Considerable action was taken by Jehovah’s witnesses, who formed a committee of three of their number to act as spokesmen. They demanded of the prison head that they be granted their legal right to indulge in their manner of worship, and further insisted that a better stating of their case be sent to the head of the Federal Prisons at Washington, D. C. Finally word came from Washington, which made it possible for the return of their Bibles and one book to each prisoner. Some of the boys share the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World;</span><span class="font5"> others, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children; </span><span class="font5">some, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook;</span><span class="font5"> etc. The Lord has seen that they are well supplied now. They have study meetings every night of the week and are diligently applying themselves, realizing they may be deprived of this privilege at any time They are rejoicing daily to be soldiers of the King. All urge those who still have their freedom to be found in the Lord’s service now while you can. When you are deprived of the privilege of giving public testimony to the Lord’s name, greatly do you regret opportunities missed in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AN HONEST CHIEF (CH1LLAN, CHILE)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While working from house to house during the special Testimony Period in Chilian, I was taken to the Division of Investigation by officers. The chief of investigation, questioning me as to the work I was doing, asked me for my permission and authorization. I answered that I was doing this by Jehovah’s permission, and gave him my card from the Watch Tower Society. Reading the card, he noted all the Scriptural texts and stated: ‘Why should you want more permission, being authorized by the One above!’ Then addressing the officers who had brought me in, he said that they brought into the Division people who are engaged in doing good, but that thieves and the like they do not bring in because they receive from them twenty or thirty pesos. Being free, I returned to my work.”</span></p>
